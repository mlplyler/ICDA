1 2	do not be fooled by the proffessional photos this hotel looks sad externally and is sad internally.[SEP]the surrounding area was not clean with rubbish & litter on the sidewalks.[SEP]the rooms are old and shabby not clean and the bed pillows were stained and smelled of body odours.[SEP]we were warned by locals to stay to the brightly lit areas for our own personal safety.[SEP]after visiting toronto, quebec & ottawa this was the only time we felt nervous for our safety definitely not recommended, at any price![SEP]briant.
3	it was the fault of my life selecting san giusto hotel.[SEP]it was a central hotel but that is all.[SEP]the elevator is not in the entrance you have to climb long stairs to reach it.[SEP]the room is very small, every door in the room includes the door of the wardrobe does not function well and noisy.[SEP]the bath was terrific ; toilet siphon was out of function, the shower handle was broken, not mounted on the wall, it was on the floor.[SEP]we warned the staff about the problems, nothing has changed.[SEP]breakfast includes nothing, it is disgusting.[SEP]while we were leaving the hotel, they demonstrated their real attitude to their clients, behaved very agressive.[SEP]i recommend any hotel in rome but not san giusto...
1 4 6	just returned home from 5 nights at the grand via veneto.[SEP]the hotel exceeded our expectations.[SEP]as with all great hotels, they clearly pride themselves on providing the highest level of service.[SEP]we were there for 5 nights and they did not skip a beat, from the " always there " doorman to the attentive and very professional bar and breakfast staff.[SEP]our spacious and exquisitely appointed room was on the top floor with 2 beautiful " juliette " balconies offering iconic views of rome.[SEP]the hotel also has an absolutely gorgeous rooftop with comfortable seating and a fabulous spa / jacuzzi (we were there in november so they were not serving but it was a great spot to sit and relax at the end of the day).[SEP]a pefect stay in every way!
3 4	i typically don't expect a lot from airport hotels.[SEP]these hotels typically have a very high volume of guests who typically don't stay for much more than a couple of nights.[SEP]in sum, i wasn't expecting a lot by staying here.[SEP]however, i was extremely disappointed in the cleanliness of the room, especially for such a reputable and high quality brand such as sheraton (starwood).[SEP]the room itself i found to be generally clean, however the bathroom was the worst.[SEP]there was a lot of loose hair in the bathroom, the mirror had water spots on it, and there were dirty towels hanging from the top of the shower.[SEP]i basically felt as if the room had not been cleaned by housekeeping staff before my check in.[SEP]i also felt like the front desk staff was not very welcoming.[SEP]i felt like i was a burden to the staff by checking in.[SEP]the welcome was not warm or informative.[SEP]nothing more occurred here other than an exchange of my id, credit card and a room key.[SEP]not even an exchange of smiles.[SEP]even though i will not recommend this hotel, i would hate to say, " don't stay here " based on my single overnight experience.[SEP]the hotel is very close to lax and nearby office buildings.[SEP]it certainly provides a convenience if you need to be in the area.[SEP]it also provides nice views if you enjoy watching airplanes.[SEP]more than anything, i just want my voice to be heard about a disappointing experience i had here.
1 3	i was there for the marathon weekend - the front desk staff was rude - i could not check in until 4 pm - and they neglected to tell me that there would be a $3 charge per bag for them to store my luggage until then.[SEP]despite leaving my room before 9 am and placing the " please clean my room " sign on the door - when i returned at 7 pm the room was not cleaned and when i called for towels - after waiting 1/2 hour - no towels - i finally received towels after returning from dinner and calling twice again (apparently the manager was stuck in the elevator!!![SEP]the wait for the elevators was on average 10 mins - it was easier to go up and then go down - the bathroom was moldy and the airconditioners did not work - they switch off the a / c in november - but it was 70 degrees in nyc!![SEP]i travel to nyc quite a lot and i would never recommend this hotel
5	the management and staff went out of their way to make our stay memorable.[SEP]there were a few problems with respect to our suite but management responded immediately and fixed some of our concerns.[SEP]the views from our room were spectacular and we enjoyed the close proximity to the ocean.[SEP]apparently the hotel will undergo a major room renovation project during 2010.[SEP]this is needed.[SEP]once done this hotel will deserve a 5 star rating.
1	i stayed at this motel during a major convention based upon price, reviews, and the fact that this motel offered a free shuttle service to the convention center.[SEP]the motel was clean, the rooms were nice, the staff was good, but if you're counting on the shuttle for transportation, it might be more at their convenience than yours and depending on the number of users, times might vary.[SEP]the pool was unusable two of the five days we were there.[SEP]but all in all, it was a good stay and things worked out.
10 11	dissapointing for a hilton![SEP]we stayed here november 2006, just before thanksgiving.[SEP]during this time, the hotel is not crowded.[SEP]rooms: the rooms are good size, larger than general hotel rooms and if you happen to have a room in the rainbow tower, at the very end facing the sea, they are absolutely amazing![SEP]of all the rooms i have had in any hotel, i think i will always remember the view from these rooms 鈥?we had two.[SEP]the higher, the better.[SEP]food: this hotel has very low quality food, for a hilton, it surprised us.[SEP]we tried various restaurants in the hotel, yet the food as always old, aged, not tasty and expensive for what鈥檚 offered.[SEP]and do not, do not eat at the restaurant next to the water way with ducks and fish in it, because you will loose your appetite due to the smell of the duck droppings and fish in the water.[SEP]grounds: the grounds of the hotel need dusting off![SEP]everything looked like they were covered with dust, just not a clean feeling.[SEP]although the hotel has a superb location and is a huge complex with potential, it is not maintained well.[SEP]conclusion: we would not stay here again, mostly because the food is bad![SEP]but if you are not worried about quality of food, then this is a good hotel.[SEP]not very good, not bad, just average 鈥?not worth more than 200 dollars per night.
1 1 2	ä± worked as a hotel controler for a long times, traveled all over world and i saw all kä±nd of hotels.[SEP]this place worth to stay because excellent service, nice rooms, perfect location, delicious food and very reasonable price.[SEP]we left very happy from there, felt like we are in home.[SEP]i advice everybody to stay there....
2	cheap and discounted price.[SEP]fast check in and out, service just for extra money (known).[SEP]small room (known), 1 bed - linen for 2 people, some blood on the duvet, lot of hair in the bed, capillary paperwalls, unopening window, the " bedroom " is separated from the bathroom by just a glas, no toilet brush, super shower.[SEP]1 min.[SEP]to tram 25, 20 min.[SEP]to central station by tram (eur 2,6/ pers.) you must beware of this hotel if you are a new couple.[SEP]highly recommended for the budget travellers, 1 room, 2 nights, eur 52.
2 2	i had the misfortune recently of staying in the st giles hotel, i was staying on business and had a single occupancy room reserved for myself.[SEP]the room was the size of a cupboard with a make shift bathroom, i use the term' bathroom' lightly as it was infact a toilet cubicle with a shower built in to the wall cavity.[SEP]the cleanliness of the room was poor and the overall feel of the hotel was tired........... very tired with a strange smell of stale food in the corridors!
0 0	the shore resort and spa was a beautiful place to stay with my family and small childre, i love the look of the rooms cause they are so much nicer than a typical look of a hotel room..[SEP]felt cozy![SEP]pool and beach were great & food to![SEP]you must order room service for breakfast the pancakes and french toast is delicious and an adult order is enough for 2 people... i can't wait to go back next year!
2	this was my second stay and although hotel is a bit dated i find the rooms very comfortable.[SEP]beds are extremely soft.[SEP]executive room that we booked was spacious and very clean.[SEP]marble bathroom had a bath tub and a shower cabin.[SEP]we were overlooking the green park and big ben through the trees.[SEP]hotel staff is proffesional.[SEP]they welcomed us very warmly and hotel has an unbeatable location.[SEP]i would always return to this hotel gladly.
0 0	we found every thing excellent the service the staff the location and the design for these resons we will come again.
2 3	i expected a big, impersonal best western, but this turned out to be a very cozy, small hotel with a pretty courtyard and a nice quiet location.[SEP]we asked for a room facing the meadow and had a lovely surprise when two hot air balloons took off from it one morning.[SEP]the rooms are pleasant, the staff is attentive and having the breakfast in the courtyard is a bonus.[SEP]we had a very nice stay.
1 1 1 2 3	stayed at the meriton early june 2009 for four nights have stayed on previous times with no real dramas.[SEP]this time our first room was dirty main bedroom had heavily stained beds including matress and pillow 2nd bedroom had what looked like some kind of bug in the bed very hard to even think about getting into bed.[SEP]carpets dirty clearly not cleaned even though the cleaners were still in the room as we checked in.[SEP]after being allowed to change room beds slightly cleaner but still clearly not a clean hotel.[SEP]having stayed at the mertion before i was very disappointed at the hotel this time.[SEP]i will be looking else where for a different hotel next time.[SEP]hotel does have a good location with coles close by
2	i read the reviews on here and was expecting better, to be honest.[SEP]my disappointment might be partly because we stayed in the four seasons (hk) just prior, and to compare them is only natural![SEP]the room was satisfactory, but i expected more of a disney feel for the kids.[SEP]the room looked a bit dated, and there was no wow factor for the kids.[SEP]the staff were nice, and certainly very friendly to the kids.[SEP]the playroom was a nice idea, but i thought it could have done with more toys / activities.[SEP]the pool area was fantastic, our daughters spent a couple of hours on the slide, and the pool staff were extremely attentive and very vigilant.[SEP]i was impressed by their attention to our children's safety, although of course we were supervising them the whole time too.[SEP]the character breakfast was worthwhile, but the food was only so - so.[SEP]the characters were brilliant though, and spent plenty of time at each table, and made all the children feel special.[SEP]a must![SEP]the park is only a short walk away, so that's a huge plus.[SEP]the meals at the hotel were ok, but very expensive.[SEP]we paid $10aud for a bottle of water with dinner![SEP]my tip would be to feed kids dinner at the park, rather than eat at the hotel.
1 2	my sister and i took a trip for my 40th birthday to none other than cancun.[SEP]we stayed at the occidental grand where we had a faboulous time.[SEP]the rooms were cleaned daily, the staff (armando who work the sports bar) was terrifc it was more than i could ask for, for a birthday celebration.[SEP]i loved it so much we are already starting to plan for next year's trip!!!!
0 0 6 8	unfortunately our stay at the rosedale in june 2010 was a huge disapointment.[SEP]we expected it to be much better than it was.[SEP]especially because of the cost.[SEP]they are an affiliate of a timeshare company in which we frequently use and they are supposed to have upgrade suites, so that was our reason for choosing the rosedale.[SEP]we requested a suite for 4 adults & they gave us what they told me was " the most updated 2 br.[SEP]superior suite " they have.[SEP]the room decor was by far the most dated of any hotel i have stayed in the last 15 years.[SEP]all the larger appliances were loud & old, the tv was small & out of date.[SEP]we felt like we were staying in a dingy hotel on the wrong side of the tracks, rather than a nice suite in downtown vancouver.[SEP]we also found " rosies ", the pub downstairs to be a disapointment as well.[SEP]they charge for internet service & as well as a nightly fee to park.[SEP]the location of the hotel was good but for the price we defintely felt ripped off.
5	very loud.[SEP]right near 59th st.[SEP]bridge.[SEP]a lot of traffic and construction noise.[SEP]surly service people.[SEP]bathroom not clean.[SEP]strange accoustics.[SEP]voices and sounds from other rooms come in through vents.[SEP]no exhaust fan in bath so shower steams up whole room.[SEP]far from subways.[SEP]there are numerous better choices.
1 2	i´ve choosen this hotel reviewing trip advisor, and it was all we wanted and more, it was mora than a boutique hotel, very friendly and exquisite decoration.[SEP]the rooms were great and everything was clean.[SEP]excellent choice.[SEP]the location was very good, a few blocks of the empire state, we´ve walked sinde the hotel to times square without problems, very good.[SEP]i would definitly would choose it again.
6 7	book this hotel at your own risk![SEP]my favorite part was when we left.[SEP]not only is the staff unfriendly and incompetent, the hotel was under construction the entire time we were there and the place was a mess.[SEP]the last day there, the numbers on the doors were taken off so we didn't even know which rooms were ours.[SEP]we rented a rollaway bed and the front desk clerk charged me $479 for it instead of the $15 it should have cost.[SEP]when i brought this to their attention, there was no apology, as if this sort of thing happens quite often.[SEP]the rooms were small, the air conditioning didn't work, and there was a strange smell that we never could figure out.[SEP]reading the prior reviews, i thought people were exagerating because the place couldn't be that bad.... i was wrong, it was worse!
4	i spent 5 nights at this splendid hotel with my wife and two kids (2 and 5).[SEP]5 tripadvisor stars really deserved.[SEP]very good position, 10 minutes walking from the eiffel tower and few meters from the metro station.[SEP]delicious breakfast.[SEP]very clean.[SEP]cordial and helpful staff.[SEP]spacious rooms.[SEP]reccomended.
0	great location average room.[SEP]can hear everything above below and beside you.[SEP]bfast average at best but location is excellent close to metro and walking to st germain and latin quarter and montparnasse
0 1	we loved this hotel because we like modern clean contemporary designs.[SEP]the hotel room is big enough with trendy bathroom, unlike other old fashioned hotels in the us but that's up to everyone's taste.[SEP]the location is great as it's fairly close to everything on the strip.[SEP]check - in was a bit of nightmare as big queues at every desk and staff walking around trying to direct people into the queues, they would be more useful if they opened more counters and put these " helpers " behind, but that's us, not sure how that works in other hotels, maybe we were there just at the busy time, other than that, can't complain:-)
3 4 5	not as expected my husband, daughter (2 years old) and myself just got back after a one week stay, feb 4 - 11.[SEP]the grounds, pool and beach are gorgeous.[SEP]the food was decent.[SEP]our room was horrible.[SEP]it was so musty and there was black mold all over the ceiling.[SEP]it looked like someone sponge painted the ceiling in black.[SEP]it was also growing in the a / c vents.[SEP]we requested a room change and told they did not have any and to come back the next day.[SEP]the next day, we weren't on the list and so on and so forth.[SEP]we never got a new room.[SEP]the service was not good either.[SEP]the servers in the restaurant speak english, but refuse to.[SEP]i can speak some spanish so we got along ok.[SEP]they also were not very friendly.[SEP]the bartenders were so slow even when there wasn't anyone in line.[SEP]they also always seemed put out and all we ordered were cokes and pina coladas - nothing difficult.[SEP]the beach was quite beautiful and there were plenty of chairs and huts.[SEP]the food was ok, not bad.[SEP]we always found something to eat and were always full.[SEP]i would not go back to this resort or this country.[SEP]the locals just weren't that friendly.[SEP]we have been to several islands, and never been treated so unfriendly.
1 3	this hotel has two very separate very different blocks.[SEP]although i realise that not all hotels are willing to take groups i do feel that hotels which do should not still charge four star prices for what can only be describe as a cheap two star experience.[SEP]bedroom were tiny (i know we're in london) but you could bearly walk around the bedroom.[SEP]decors was tatty, and everything in our block in a very bed state of repair.[SEP]breakfast was a complete free for all, with a lack of bowls & plates not to mention food items to put on them.[SEP]all service in a conference room.[SEP]i have since a school dining hall with more atmosphere and better food![SEP]if you are going to offer this quality of product and service to groups then i feel it's plain mis advertising to say its a four star hotel!
0	this hotel can not be 4 star... it should be 2 star hotel.[SEP]the room has not coffe maker even water to drink.[SEP]no mini bar.[SEP]small refrigerator in bathroom (!) is not working.[SEP]the worst one is that i wasted 20 min on 1st day + 40 min on next day to follow assistant instructions by phone to fix not working wifi conncention.[SEP]and finally he gave up to fix it.[SEP]i recommend to look for another hotel... if you want derseving 4 star hotel.
0 1	this was almost like being at home, but on a vacation at the same time.[SEP]the entire experence was well worth the ten [ 10 ] hour drive from north carolina.[SEP]i only wish that my family had more time to spend on our vacation to orlando and the " floridays resort ".
1 3	great for the price i was very happy with my stay at the greenwich inn.[SEP]the staff was very friendly and helpful and my room was very clean.[SEP]this is a great place to stay for the budget conscious traveller, but if you are looking for extra amenities or luxury, this is not the place for you.[SEP]pros: price, location (very near the shops and restaurants on chestnut and close to golden gate bridge), friendly staff, clean rooms, free parking, ample parkingcons: rooms are small, no telephone, thin walls.[SEP]it is a quite neighborhood and i felt safe, but due to the thin walls you can hear the street traffic at times.[SEP]if you are a light sleeper or in need of major relaxation, this could be a definite issue.
5 10 14 17	the good: staff was very nice.[SEP]room was a good size for a new york hotel.[SEP]probably due to being a corner room.[SEP]room had two beds with a sitting area and a bit of open floor space.[SEP]also had a wet bar.[SEP]bathroom was upgraded and quite clean.[SEP]location was perfect.[SEP]minutes to subway, times square and central park.[SEP]the bad: ceiling above wet bar had some issues.[SEP]the drywall appeared to have had some previous water issues and looked as if it wanted to fall off the ceiling.[SEP]the area under the wet bar was dirty and had a mouse trap.[SEP]i did not see any mice.[SEP]we stayed on the 10th floor but had to travel to the first floor for ice.[SEP]the ice machine was in a room that doubled / tripled as the vending area / business center.[SEP]that area was quite dirty.[SEP]tv was smaller than the one i had in my college dorm 25 years ago.[SEP]initially i was quite pleased with the room and the hotel but the more i was there the more i wanted to leave.[SEP]the place could be a decent option if only it was much cleaner.
7	maybe we just had a really bad experience but booked based on other peoples reviews.[SEP]arrived at 1 am, no parking nearby so stopped outside to unload our luggage and was shouted at by the security and told to move on.[SEP]when i finally had found parking which on a friday night is tough the guy in reservations was short to the point of rude.[SEP]we got up early the next morning and found that there was no shower mechanism.[SEP]literally nothing- just a screw where it should be.[SEP]we reported it to the front desk who sent a repairman up who was able to repair this and seemed unsurprised.[SEP]on checking around the room we also noticed a socket with wiring showing and a large mud mark on the end of one of the beds.[SEP]not sure who had cleaned the room but definitely not up to hi express standards.[SEP]the location must be its saving grace.[SEP]not far from the beach but would definitely recommend the hampton inn over this hotel.[SEP]for a few dollars more you get a much nicer hotel with excellent breakfast.
6	an owner operated hotel in passy, far away from the crowds is a great choice if you want to be in a residential district with fewer tourists.[SEP]great location if you're a walker--4 km romantic walk to the louvres along the docks..[SEP]the 72 bus is direct if you get tired and metro is very close by..[SEP]rooms are small by n / a standards, if you want vegas, you have to pay 3 - 4x the price of this hotel in paris.[SEP]if you book, ask for the rooms with windows in the bathroom, these rooms are 2 sq meters larger than the other ones and it makes a big difference.[SEP]a big plus are new sound proof windows and great a / c.[SEP]room cleaning is very good, beds are very comfortable.[SEP]very friendly staff including owners who work the breakfast anf front desk.t affordable bistros (for paris) nearby, including a one star michelin (ask the owner to reserve on your first day) my wife and i travel to paris frequently.[SEP]we will book there for our next time!
2 3	we have stayed at this hotel on our first night in italy on several occasions.[SEP]we just returned from our latest trip.[SEP]the hotel needs to be updated.[SEP]worn out mattresses, worn out bedding, soiled worn carpets.[SEP]the only thing it has going for it is the shuttle to and from the airport and into the center of rome.[SEP]there is now a marriott and a sheraton in the area with shuttle service.[SEP]give them a try instead.
1	dh and i stayed here for 3 nights july 2009.[SEP]the room is small, but comfortable, tastefully decorated and charming.[SEP]i would give it a 5 but the bed pillows were small squares and not standard or queen sized pillows.[SEP]i made a call to the front desk, but i was told that they don't even have regular sized pillows at all.[SEP]the hotel offers free wireless in the lobby and wired in room service for a fee.[SEP]the hotel gym is really nice and they also have a yoga room.[SEP]make sure to check out the little italy farmers market on saturday which is in walking distance.[SEP]i would stay here again but i would definitely have to bring my own pillow.
2 2 4 5 10	i agree with much of the criticism i have read.[SEP]just got back yesterday.[SEP]spectacular spot, beautiful... bring your fieldglasses if your are a naturalist or birder.[SEP]the staff are wonderful, intelligent caring and happy people.... but there are not enough of them!![SEP]room service, for all intents and purposes, is nonexistent.[SEP]no problem... we went to the walmart in playa and bought everything we needed for the week, booze included for a little over 100 usd.[SEP]the restaurants vary... some fabulous dishes, some not so hot.[SEP]any glitches in service have to do with not enough waiters working full houses.[SEP]never anyone at the concierge desk.[SEP]golf cart transportation throughout the resort excellent and fast.[SEP]summary... an amazing spot,,,not up to fairmont standards for service and dining.[SEP]quite expensive.[SEP]remember 10% surcharge for ivf (?) plus 2% accomodation charge plus a service charge added on top of the top dollar room rates.[SEP]if you've got a pile of money and a lot of patience the place is amazing.[SEP]if not, go to town to eat recommend casa d'agua and yaxche... both terrific.[SEP]stock your fridge with groceries..[SEP]forget about room service and don't bring a big family.[SEP]we really had a wonderful time but i can imagine people with higher standards than mine being very upset at the service given the cost of living at the mayakoba... they have some work to do.
0 4 9	this hotel was the worst hotel i have ever almost stayed in![SEP]my sister and i booked through a visa rewards points program (which will remain nameless).[SEP]we understood we were not staying at a four star hotel, but we did have a level of confidence that the accommodations would be suitable.[SEP]we checked in and it went downhill from there.[SEP]the hallway was musty and dark with chipped paint and carpet that was lifting and dirty.[SEP]our room was even worse.[SEP]the pictures speak for themselves.[SEP]both managers on duty were horribly rude and the " executive room " that they tried to move us to had a window that was gaping open and would not close and the a / c unit did not blow air.[SEP]after three hours of incompetence and rudeness, we finally moved to another hotel and enjoyed the rest of our stay.[SEP]keep away from this hotel!![SEP]the money you save is not worth it!
1 2 6	my family and i stayed at darussaade for 4 days.[SEP]from the moment we arrived until the moment we leave we had such a nice experince.[SEP]the kindness of the staff, the cleanness of the room, the marvellous breakfast coupled with the best location.[SEP]this was our second trip to istanbul and i must say that, in few years time we will come back to darussaade.[SEP]we usually stay at local boutique hotels in order to taste the living style of the locals as well as the beauty of the boutique and specific style.[SEP]darussaade is one of the boutique hotels that i can recommend to the ones who are planning to visit istanbul.[SEP]the hotel is very well renovated ottoman house which has a unique architecture that you can easily feel when you enter inside.[SEP]especially the kindness of the staff at darussaade and their effort to make things easier for you are the things that you can not find in anywhere else.[SEP]all in all very helpful and excellent staff, superb breakfast and the best location in sultanahmet.[SEP]highly recommended!
0 2	well i learned a lesson.[SEP]if you are concerned about the outside of a hotel and the neighborhood its in stay out.[SEP]this hotel rents by the hour and is dangerous.[SEP]how the board of health has not shut it down is amazing.[SEP]i stayed in my room for at least 5 minutes before i left.
4 5 5	as many people noted here, there are some problems with this hotel... it is seriously run down - but hey - location location location![SEP]talk about central![SEP]though it might be old and out of style, this hotel offers great rates![SEP]on average, a hotel room in manhattan goes for 300 $/night - i paid 1/2 of that during my short stay in the big apple.[SEP]i first laughed when i got to my floor - the walls are filthy - water dammage all over the place - and the shabby lighting does in fact remind me of stanley kubrick's film " the shining " starring jack nicholson.[SEP](as noted on a previous post) as the saying goes -you get what you pay for - so don't expect to have top class service nor top class accomodations when you are paying a fraction of the prices asked in hotels in the vicinity of hotel pennsylvannia.[SEP]i would recommend this hotel for people with short stays in manhattan and don't plan on staying in their hotel rooms during the day - enjoy the city - you're in the heart of it!
1 2 3 9 11	i don't even know where to start.[SEP]our room was so dirty the cleaning staff had to come back and clean it 5 minutes after our arrival.[SEP]there were ants in the bathroom as well as tufts of hair.[SEP]the mini fridge was broken and our floor was dirty.[SEP]the elevators are not air conditioned and while this may not seem like a big deal.[SEP]it is july in key west......[SEP]very hot.[SEP]we requested our linens be changed on our second day this did not take place until 7 pm.[SEP]there was sand on the lobby floor and did not look as if it had been swept in days.[SEP]the pool bathroom was so dirty with paper towel and tissue all over the floor.[SEP]there was also standing water on the floor.[SEP]there were dirty towels on the chairs with piles of dirty towels at the towel stand.[SEP]this is absolutely not worthy of the waldorf name.
0	we only stayed 3 nights, but the staff is really what makes the stay.[SEP]very friendly![SEP]my husband had left his cc and the staff was more than willing to call and help locate it.[SEP]also, i liked the quiteness of the hotel.[SEP]there wasn't a noisy crowd in the hall which is usually what keeps me awake at night.
5 6	we used this hotel for our 437th troop carrier group wwii reunion.[SEP]their service surpassed our expectations.[SEP]the location is city center with great views of the harbor from the rooms.[SEP]we were upgraded to the presidental suite on the 12th floor that everyone hung out at.[SEP]as some of the guest were in the 80's and even 90's -- this is a wwii group after all, the hotel was handicapped accessible and we never felt cramped in any part of the hotel with all of the walkers, wheelchairs and strollers for the great - grandchildren.[SEP]breakfast was real social each morning and the staff helpful with immediately cleaning off tables for the next guest.[SEP]we had our banquet the last night -- staff was accomodating to last minute requests, banquet room was super clean (the rug) spacious and the food was superurb.
1	we stayed for 2 nights after a 10 hour flight.[SEP]the check in was fast and problem free, the room was very nice, bathroom quite small but well appointed but the best was the heated outdoor pool right amongst all the sky scrapers.[SEP]we had breakfast which was excellent and great value at $17 a head.[SEP]the staff we met were very good.[SEP]the only problem for me was that we stayed at the georgia after travelling to whistler for a few days.[SEP]do nt get me wrong, the l'hermitage is very good but the georgia was in a totally different league and i would stay at the latter every time.[SEP]it is much more expensive however but, for me, it was so worth it.
3 4	arrived and there was a huge line for check - in.[SEP]no priority club or ambassador check - in either.[SEP]same issue upon departure.[SEP]upgraded to a very nice suite with a lovely view of a rooftop![SEP]it's one of those places that does certain things really well and then let's themselves down on the simple things like having no staff in the club lounge during the' quiet' period (middle of day) so if you happen to go in, you will find dirty tables, nothing in the fridges etc.[SEP]not what i expect of an intercontinental branded hotel, especially given the price per night.
2 3 3 4 8 9	i have travelled around the world and stayed in more hotels than i could possibly count.[SEP]many, many, many cost significantly less than this hotel.[SEP]absolutely none approached the absolutely awful conditions of this hotel.[SEP]we had black mold in the room and the bathroom was so disgusting i was afraid to touch fixtures / walk without socks on the floor.[SEP]the bedding was disgusting, and filth in the bathroom made me use wash cloths to touch everything.[SEP]a colleague from austria said " the room was fine as long as you didn't touch anything.[SEP]sirens all night outside as well.[SEP]this hotel survives because there are suckers born every day.... absolutely no one who has ever stayed in the hotel once would ever return again.[SEP]absolutely disgusting.[SEP]filthy, smelly, disgusting and totally ruined my experience of nyc.
3 4	we planned your trip 2 months ahead.[SEP]we were to have a king size bed, when we get there we were told there were none, so i asked what was open the girl tells me a room with 2 queens.[SEP]we were tired after traveling all day, so we took the room, we get there and we had 2 full size beds.[SEP]the room looked nothing like the picture online.[SEP]there were burn holds in the bedspreds.[SEP]the people there wern't friendly, i complained at the front desk, but they didn't care either.[SEP]very run down place.[SEP]we stayed away as much as we could because it was so bad, me and my husband couldn't even sleep in the same bed.
2 6	after staying a couple of nights at tropicana we moved to excalibur.[SEP]tropicana wins hands down.[SEP]excalibur is rather old, with dirty carpets.[SEP]our room was large and bed comfortable but you did not want to stay there (maybe that was intentional).[SEP]the swimming pools were not very attractive (as you put a couple of swimming pools in the middle of a parking lot) but large enough to accommodate a lot of people.[SEP]casino very dark, with low ceilings and way too many people for our liking.[SEP]it was our first visit to las vegas and if we ever come back it would not be to excalibur.
3 5	we have been fortunate enough to stay in some excellent hotels around the world including the wynn (las vegas), the ritz carlton south beach (miami) and can easily say that the radisson bloomsbury is equal to if not better than these hotels with respect to its customer service.[SEP]the level of this service is second to none the staff are both polite and courteous and will do all they can to accommodate your needs.[SEP]we had the pleasure of meeting kumar who is the guest relations manager at the hotel and is a credit to the radisson edwardian family.[SEP]the hotel itself is beautiful and the restaurant is extremely comfortable with an excellent menu.[SEP]london is very competitive when it comes to hotels and restaurants but i highly recommend not only staying in this hotel but dining in the restaurant.[SEP]this is the only place we ’ll be staying for our next and future visits.[SEP]thanks once again for all your help kumar it was a great couple of days made all the better by the hotel and your outstanding service.
1 4 5	this is our second stay this year.[SEP]new mgmt disappointing, get go staff told us economy problems caused shortage in staff, so no daily room cleaning or clean towels.[SEP]told we had to wash our own.[SEP]we would not book here again, as mgmt is rude and sloppy to guests.[SEP]you almost have to beg for towels or to have a bathroom cleaned before mid stay clean.[SEP]dirty towels are not sanitary, and we are very disappointed.[SEP]we thought the deli owner rude, and unsure of the current management also.
4 6 7	i came to toronto for a wedding with a group of 20 family members.[SEP]we were assured that all the rooms would be together, whereas some family members were in a different building all together.[SEP]do not be deceived by the pictures, they have since done renovations, and the business suites no longer look like the photos.[SEP]when family members asked for discounts due to the misconception of the rooms, they refused and didn't offer an apology.[SEP]the first night i had stayed in my room, the sheets smelled like they had not been changed.[SEP]we had put the towels in the bathtub for new ones to be put in the room, only they took the towels out of the tub and put them back in the holder.[SEP]would never stay here again!![SEP]bad service, unclean rooms, very noisy due to highway noise
0 1	we have stayed at this hotel several times and have never been disappointed.[SEP]the location in the champs de mars area not far from the eiffel tower is ideal, it is on a metro stop, the concierge and hotel help are outstanding and helpful and the breakfast is superb.[SEP]the view of the eiffel tower out our window was magic and it had a light show for the holidays.[SEP]one block from rue cler... a typical parisienne market street![SEP]we have also rented their apartment and studio.
1	we did not get to the hotel until just after midnight, (flight delayed) the staff greeted us with open arms and were very friendly.[SEP]room was fantastic and we could see the space needle, lovely sight at night.[SEP]breakfast i can't say enough, they had lots and lots of different items, from sausage to hard boiled eggs, waffles to pastry's fruit and donuts, not to forget the usa today for you to have.[SEP]the staff helped us plan our full day in seattle, was super and said to say the pump had gone out on the pool, but jacuzzi was working.[SEP]upon check out on friday a maintenance crew was fixing the pool, hats off to this hotel and its location, it was even safe to walk around in the evening..[SEP]there were 2 terminals with free access to the internet, coffee and cold drinks in the foyer at all times.[SEP]thanks for a wonderful stay
0 2	the hotel is dated and beat up and despite its great location and free internet (with an ethernet cord), i won't be back.[SEP]services, such as coffee, tea, and ice buckets, that are standard in the industry were non - existent at the flatotel.[SEP]i was completely unimpressed with the hotel and its staff including its housekeeping staff who left me questioning whether the bathroom counter and floors were cleaned regularly.[SEP]the lobby tries to look cool and sleek but comes off as cold, uninviting, and loud.[SEP]elevator service is beyond lousy, taking far too long for arrival in the lobby or my floor.[SEP]as to the room and its decor, outdated, outdated, outdated... from the long, impractical hallway, to the nook area with no lights, no coffee maker, and no reason to be there, to the television, to the bathroom.[SEP]the bathroom was in bad shape with missing tiles and an extremely slow draining bath drain that when reported to the front desk remained slow draining throughout my stay.[SEP]water leaked everywhere from the poorly designed shower enclosure.[SEP]the television was from another time... a time before flat screens and hdtv.[SEP]for nyc, the hotel was a huge disappointment - especially at the rates charged.
1	you get what you pay for.[SEP]not the cleanest rooms but bed was clean and so was bathroom.[SEP]bring your own towels though as very thin.[SEP]service was excellent, let us book in at 8:30am![SEP]for location and price, this can't be beaten, but it is cheap for a reason.[SEP]if you come expecting the hilton, then book the hilton![SEP]for uk travellers, think of a blackpool b&b.
4 5 6 11	i booked this hotel via a pre - paid web site and admit the price was good compared to most hotels in rome.[SEP]but, it was a big mistake, one i won't soon make again.[SEP]i was quite disappointed that it was billed as a 4-star hotel on the site.[SEP]i don't think i would give it more than 2 stars personally.[SEP]the room was dark, very outdated and dirty.[SEP]the shower curtain was stained and there were scuff marks all over the tub.[SEP]the carpet was filthy and shabby.[SEP]the bed spread was old and outdated.[SEP]the tv looked to be from the 80s.[SEP]this hotel is badly in need of a renovation and amenity facelift.[SEP]the breakfast was ok.[SEP]the staff didn't change the stained tableclothes between uses.[SEP]the only highpoint from my point of view was the location.[SEP]it was very close to the vatican and a short walk to the metro.[SEP]however, i would not stay there again.
4	stayed here 7 nights december 2011, 2 adults and 2 teenage daughters.[SEP]stayed in a premier room which were huge and ample room for the 4 of us.[SEP]the hotel is located in a great location approx 5 minutes walk to orchid road.[SEP]breakfast was great and service couldn't be faulted.[SEP]hotel is very clean.[SEP]we would highly recommend this hotel for couples and families.
0	bed not very comfortable.[SEP]the pool is very small about 12 x 12 and 3' 6 " deep.
3 4 7	we arrived at 8:30am on sunday morning, after a 14 hours airline excursion and had to wait till 2:00 before we could check in.[SEP]we slept in the lobby, and waited till check in time.[SEP]the room number was 136, the room did nt look anything like the photos on the website, we had two twin bed pushed together instead of a king size bed.[SEP]the ac was inadequate, and the one window in the room on the first floor faced an alley, whereby we could observe the rubbish being put out every morning.[SEP]i was very dissappointed.[SEP]the buffet breakfast in the garden included in the package was the only good thing about the hotel.[SEP]the lobby and parlor was elegant, but the room we stayed in was not anything to write home about.[SEP]the shower was too small, and drain was clogged with hair.[SEP]we would not stay at the quirinale again.[SEP]when we checked out, our bill was.60 cents for three local phone calls, we did nt eat or use any of the hotel ammenaties that we would have to pay for.[SEP]it was close to the train station which we used a lot, we went to florence, assisi, and many other towns were available from the train station.
0 4	what a load of rubbish â£100 a night for a hotel that smells like a butchers.[SEP]the food is dire, they had 3 things on the menu, i asked for canneloni and to be honest wasn't expecting much but when it came it was a tough as leather.[SEP]the bar man couldn't have cared less, the food was a microwave meal with some salad that was just about within sell by date.[SEP]the man on reception kept me waiting for 10 mins before he served me, i arrived and he saw me and then walked off.[SEP]no " i'll be one minute sir " definetly by far the worst hotel i have stayed in in london (and i have stayed in a few)
2 3	if it's space you want you won't be disappointed.[SEP]ny hotels are definitely not known for the space, this hotel however is full of space.[SEP]my husband and i enjoyed our stay at the sofitel.[SEP]we would definitely stay here again.[SEP]if you stay here first you won't want to stay anywhere else!
2 3 6	myhusband surprised me for my birthday with a stay at the rancho bernardo inn.[SEP]even though we live in san diego, i felt like i was on vacation.[SEP]great service, excellent food and a beautiful property... very quiet and relaxing.[SEP]we also enjoyed first rate spa services at their beautiful spa that has one of the most gorgeous pools and cabana setups i have ever seen at a spa.[SEP]in addition, our massages were done in private japanese style houses.[SEP]the following morning our children joined us for our thanksgiving dinner on the veranda.[SEP]overall, it exceeded my expectations and i would recommend it to anyone - whether for business or for pleasure.
0 3	this hotel is fantastic![SEP]we walked to the hotel from the aerobus stop in 10 minutes and to the city centre in 20 so the location was ideal.[SEP]the hotel itself has beautiful modern decor and a relaxing feel, and the rooms were spacious with all the amenities you'd expect including lovely toiletries and excellent air conditioning.[SEP]the attention to detail is impressive, even down to the aroma in the corridors.[SEP]as others have mentioned, we also found the roof top bar to be a great place to relax in the early evening, it really made our trip to have somewhere nice to chill out after a busy day sightseeing.[SEP]and the free drinks and snacks between 5 and 7 pm were lovely too (especially the tea selection).[SEP]we wouldn't hestitate to recommend this hotel and hope to come back one day!
0 0 3	beautiful common areas and the staff was very friendly.[SEP]i had a bit of bad luck in that it took me thirty minutes to recheck into my room on the second day of my stay.[SEP]the friendly staff made up for it nicely by giving me $50 in vouchers that my wife and i used for a nice breakfast on sunday morning.[SEP]i would stay there again anytime.
2 4	this hotel was told to be all lovely and rosey, reality it is nt to be fair i would nt allow my animals in here.[SEP]the rooms were unstable and easy excessable to the public, and theifs could easly be tempted by vaubles on show.[SEP]the bathroom looked like a cloak cupboard, and you could nt even turn round without banging into another wall.[SEP]the breakfast was one cold over cooked boiled egg with just a piece of toast, not very good to be starting the day.[SEP]staff were not understanding towards our needs and also not sympathetic towards our circumstances, and were nt vert trusting in the visitors.[SEP]the image outside is very diseaving and the website even more so, the â£90 we spent for a one night stay was unable to be justified.
0	enjoyed my stay at " coconut " very clean comfortable and quiet accommodation.[SEP]staff most helpful and courteous.[SEP]morning breakfast very good.[SEP]will come back!!
0 2 5 6 7	june 4, 2007 we were on a senior bus tour and what a shock to see this filthy, mold smelling room.[SEP]we stayed one night and had to move to a holiday inn across the street for $171.00 a night for our additional 2 nights.[SEP]it was worth a lot more than that to be able to breath.[SEP]ice machine broke, had to walk across busy 4 lane highway to get ice at a quarter a small bucket.[SEP]no blankets in rooms, no tissues and desk gave a customer an extra roll of toilet paper to take the place of tissues.[SEP]all rooms reeked of cigerettes and/or musty mold.[SEP]spraying and candles of no help.[SEP]this place should be closed up for the dirt.[SEP]no coffee pot.[SEP]everyone complained and will think twice before booking a trip with this travel agency.
1 4 7	we were scheduled to stay at this hotel for three nights.[SEP]when we arrived, we found that the " newly renovated rooms " were old and outdated, not to mention musty!!![SEP]we were told that we would be able to access the internet however, we were never able to do so.[SEP]when we questioned this, we were asked what kind of computer we had... not to our suprise, we were told that it didn't work with our brand of computer.[SEP]when we got ready for bed, we found that the sheets and comforter smelled horribly and did not " smell " like they had been changed.[SEP]we advised the staff of this and were told that they would put clean sheets on the bed and have our comforter washed... leaving us to think that they are not washed after every use![SEP]needless to say, our trip was less than enjoyable and we left after two nights.[SEP]we will never stay there again and totally advise against it.
0 1 1	this place is a real dumppppppp went there with my girlfriend to stay for 3 nights it was a real anarchy first the front desk had no personality![SEP]who hires these people no greeting what so ever and also no such help with luggage the handyman was dirty and kept complaining about some job he did there and for some reason was checkin my girl out and also the place stinked they did nt service our room for 3 nights and i spoke to someone but no one cared and i wanted to approach the manager but i see he did nt give a damn as much as i saw no one worked here its just a big scamm people (even motel 6 its not like these as these people do nt know the first thing about hotel business so do yourself a favor and go somewere else as i found out from front desk there is plenty other hotels in the area who actually give a damn about what they are doing.[SEP]good day wish you the best fellow travelers
2 4 9	we read the reviews just before we went and our hearts sank but on arrival we were pleasantly surprised.[SEP]not only were the staff helpful and polite but the decor was fresh and airy.[SEP]our room (941) was clean, beautifully decorated and well - equipped - iron, ironing board, hairdryer, coffeemaker and masses of storage space, as well a safe.[SEP]the bathroom was big enough with a powerful and, more importantly, hot shower.[SEP]towels and linen were changed everyday and the temperature in the room was easily controlled by a themostat system that you control.[SEP]for what we paid (â£400 for 4 nights inc ba flights) we were thrilled.[SEP]location and facilities were excellent, the tea place, subtle tea, across the street on the corner of madison and 30th is amazing as is the deli just along 30th street- cafe au bon gout- is great for quick breakfasts and great service.[SEP]zana, the hotel's restaurant, wasn't great but then we'd previously eaten at cafe carlyle so the standard set was high.[SEP]would we go back?[SEP]most definitely - a real find.
0 1 1 4 5 6 7	honestly this hotel was a dump, i wouldn't of let me dog stay there to be honest.[SEP]the hotel was dirty and so tired.[SEP]anyone that rates this hotel as good must have very low standards is all i can say.[SEP]i wouldn't touch this place with a barge pole.[SEP]the first room they put us in was the size of a shoebox and dirty, i refused to even put my bag down on the floor![SEP]the next room wasn't much better just bigger - it would seem this was the best it was going to get in this shocking hotel.[SEP]don't get me wrong i know hotel rooms in ny aren't big but they should at least be clean![SEP]i went to ny the previous year and didn't experience a hotel that was like this so i wouldn't recommend staying there to anyone if you stay there be warned the place is really dirty, decor completely dated, bar staff are pretty rude and reception staff seemed pretty uninterested when we complained as well.[SEP]it was that bad that we almost checked into another hotel - we were only there for four nights.
2 2 4 5 8 10	we stayed for 5 days, and reading all the other reviews i must say this hotel has 2 faces.[SEP]the quality differs per floor and room very much.[SEP]on arrival they offered us a horrible, worn out, dirty room (4th floor) (i thought that a corpse had been hidden under the bed for a month or so!!).[SEP]we wisely refused to move in and insisted on a solution.[SEP]that took some time but one of the receptionist made good effort and offerd us an excecutive room on 12th floor and that was reasonable.[SEP]we had to pay an adittional $25 a day, but as an extra breakfast, coffe and tea, a fridge and internet acces (free) was included, not a bad deal.[SEP]i can not understand how such big differences are possible in one hotel.[SEP]and we were not the only couple with this problem.[SEP]we were with 4 couples together and without any doubt, they were offered the same lousy, dirty, [ -- ] rooms at first also (and of course they refused as well).[SEP]they also got upgraded after complaining.[SEP]strange place hotel penn!
0 3	stayed from the 15 to 17 september, very impressed with the room.[SEP]easy walking distance to universal studios.[SEP]short drive to hollywood bvd.[SEP]7.95 per access wifi was disappointing, but overall would highly recommend.
6 6	this is a 3-star hotel but it certainly didn't feel that way.[SEP]staff manning the office were not friendly, and have a " couldn't care " attitude, not very helpful when asked questions on how to get around the city.[SEP]there is no lift in this hotel, so we have to lug our 15 kg luggage up ourselves.[SEP]the beds are lumpy and sunken in the middle and heater in our room didn't work.[SEP]when we asked the staff about the heater, they gave us the " live with it " kind of answer.[SEP]location is good, no doubt, close to shops, restaurants, and train station, and to the hyde park.[SEP]other than that, i wouldn't recommend this hotel which doesn't live up to its 3-star status.
4	we stayed in early november for four nights and found it to be a really good hotel.[SEP]it is in a good location, close to the subway and shopping and was a good place to set out on daily adventures.[SEP]however it is a few blocks uphill walk which is tiring after a full day walking and touring, but then you have a great hotel to come back too.[SEP]what really impressed me was after the first night we were told the maid found some problem with the air conditioning (i didn't notice any problem) and they would have to switch us which was fine and it was to an upgraded room.[SEP]both rooms were very clean and quiet.[SEP]the rooms are excellent, large and very comfortable.[SEP]the breakfast is just ok.[SEP]i found that our two week stay, which included five hotels throughout greece and rome that none of the breakfasts were really great, same general fare at all.[SEP]this was one of the better ones.[SEP]the hotel staff was friendly and helpful.[SEP]good hotel, nice rooms, good area.[SEP]very glad to have made this choice.
0 0 1 1	rooms smelled (so then all your clothes did as well), someone got a towel with feces on it (not kidding) they refused to comp the room like they initially promised, horrible customer service![SEP]sewer problem, caught wiffs of it by the pool.[SEP]only good part is food was decent and beds were comfortable.
0 4	we just returned from a stay at secrets capri - we were there april 17th thru 22nd... we had a great time - the resort was the best all inclusive we've stayed in so far.[SEP]we've been to several in cancun, cabo and the bahamas... i can think of nothing to complain about - all the good reviews you've read are true.[SEP]we're 50ish, so the smaller, quieter, adult - oriented atmosphere was great... non of that head - banging music during the day... we smiled when they played 70's type music as well as frank sinatra, etc... i'm sure the younger people were frowning, but we were lovin' it..[SEP]juan at the pool bar was the greatest.[SEP]we had read about him in previous reviews and he was so fun... he was so thrilled when i told him he was mentioned on the internet, so i told him i'd post his picture... just a totally memorable and thoroughly enjoyable vacation...
1	we enjoyed a three - night stay here in august.[SEP]we found the room to be outstanding, the customer service well above par, and the location to be ideal.[SEP]we will try to stay here again when in the area.[SEP]we found the lounge an ideal spot to relax in the evening.
2 3	small rooms, no extra beds for kids.[SEP]the music is playing the hall day.[SEP]very bad time in this hotel.[SEP]we will not return to this hotel.[SEP]during the night it is not possible to sleep.[SEP]times square is illuminated the hall night.[SEP]the staff is very friendly but they are not ready to help, whenever you need some help.
0	our experience staying at the manhattan club was pleasureable.[SEP]we stayed in a one bedroom and it was spacious for new york standards.[SEP]there was a fitness room on site, but we didn't use the facilities.[SEP]they served fresh coffee and tea and cookies from 11 am - 4 pm in their owner's lounge.[SEP]it's centrally located.[SEP]we were able to walk to central park, times square, broadway and subway entrances.
3 6 6	i had the misfortune to stay at the hudson.[SEP]at first, i was impressed with how beautiful / trendy it is, amazed with the friendly staff and i didn't even mind to wait in a long line to check in.[SEP]i knew in advance that rooms at the hudson were tiny, which for me was acceptable.[SEP]what was unnaceptable about that room was a malfunctioning air conditioner (which couldn't make the temperature drop below 73f) and the very unconfortable bed, with a dirty old conforter.[SEP]after a stop at the frontdesk that ended up in apologies, free drinks at the bar and a promise that the ac would be fixed, no work was done (from what i've been reading, unkept promises are fairly common at the hudson).[SEP]however, the worst was just about to happen.[SEP]when i lifted the griddle that hides the ac to see what was happening there, i found the most disgusting / unsanitary ac ever, full of dust, hair, no filter, like it has not been serviced in years.[SEP]no wonder it doesn't work.[SEP]in resume, this is a beatiful hotel that will suit you well if you like to sleep in a sauna and have no respiratory allergies.[SEP]or maybe if you want to impress your friends at the lobby.[SEP]the rooms there have nothing in common with the luxurious / trendy common areas nor with the friendly staff.[SEP]it probably was a nice place when it was well kept, but it is a shame that maintanance is not among their priorities.
0 0	i checked in around 6:00 on a saturday evening the place reeked of pot as he walked with me to the room because i didn't have any clean towels at the time.[SEP]the night clerk kept coming upstairs to change the rooms every five minutes when they didn't need changing and he would just hang around in the hallway for like ten minutes before he decided what he was going to do next.[SEP]who knows whether the guy was spying on us or not but he probably was.[SEP]the place was not cool for $163 a night.[SEP]the name of the hotel should be here's a room your stupid.[SEP]the room was a closet sized room with no curtains on the window everybody could see in i was like ok.[SEP]they gave us a thin blanket we were freeziing most of the time.[SEP]i really didn't want to ask for a blanket because that night clerk really gave me the creeps.[SEP]basically stay away it it not worth the price that was the cheapest room they had
0	nice hotel at an attractive location.[SEP]staff very service - oriented.[SEP]great rooftop terrace, with view on the san paolo dentro le mura (next to hotel), italian government buildings and san pietro (vatican).[SEP]close to termini and the city centre.[SEP]only negative side is breakfast: very much oriented on americans (meaning: lots of sausages / calories, hardly any bread, no real coffee), quite crowded and indoors (which is a pity with such a great rooftop terrace!).
1 1	this is one of those hotels you hear about and you need to experience for yourself.[SEP]this hotels has everything going for it, good service, nice rooms, nice bathroom with good shower.[SEP]great art by the dutch artist herman brood they even have his shoes on display and an artpiece motor bike in the lobby.[SEP]the restaurant has something for everybody and the chef knows what he is doing great tasting food and also very nice to look at.[SEP]you expect nothing less in an art hotel.[SEP]the location is good for those who need to travel by car or when you need to use taxi or public transport everything is close.[SEP]the price is good and this is one of those places you just need to stay at at least once.
1	the hotel was in a brilliant location and very near a metro station.[SEP]yes the room was small but it was clean and very well equipped.[SEP]the bathroom was a really good size and lets face it how long do you spend in your hotel room anyway?[SEP]the breakfast was fantastic and the staff were really friendly and helpful.[SEP]we will definately stay here when we return to barcelona.[SEP]it's worth going up to the roof of the hotel for the view over the city.
3 3	i have stayed in any number of hotels in paris and the hotel de l'abbaye remains my absolute favorite hotel.[SEP]just returned today after spending the last few days there..[SEP]probably my fifth or sixth stay.[SEP]the staff is the truly the finest, charming rooms, and beautifully decorated public rooms.[SEP]great location as well.[SEP]you will be hard pressed to find a better property.
3 4	my wife and i recently spent time in the big apple.[SEP]lots of shopping and attractions.[SEP]this hotel is perfectly situated for this activity.[SEP]the last thing anyone expects is rude hotel staff, filthy bathrooms and a ac unit that did not work.[SEP]we attempted to notify the staff, only to have a shower mat thrown over the dirty shower and a breakfast voucher for two.[SEP]this is not what we expected.[SEP]terrible customer service.
3 3	so - yes this is in a good location but the hotel is dire![SEP]i'd look around at the other stuff for the same price as you can get better.[SEP]i had to stay here for work on one occasion due to all other hotels being for wimbeldon and would never stay again.[SEP]the lobby was dirty and crowded, the room was dark, not clean and lacking in any kind of comfort.[SEP]to say the room was bare woudl be an understatment.[SEP]duvet - i'd have been better with tissue paper![SEP]i know that you get what you pay for with a tl, but if that was true for this place they should be paying us.[SEP]i'd only be staying here as a last (very) resort.
0 1 1	its been more then 12 years when we first stayed at the rio, and i still think its the best place for my family to visit.[SEP]we enjoy the food, shopping, entertainment, and most of all the rooms and friendly service, i have recommended the rio to family and friends and always will.[SEP]i would like to thank the staff at the rio for all there hard work to make us feel welcome from the time we make our reservations, and check in there friendly and helpful.[SEP]did i mention the room service wow!
6 7	my wife and i decided to combine a week long vacation with the graduation of my nephew from the marine corp basic training at mcrd in san diego.[SEP]the hotel was located in the perfect location.[SEP]the hotel not only provided a free shuttle to mcrd, but also the san diego zoo, which we took advantage of the day before family day began at mcrd.[SEP]in addition to proximity to the two locations mentioned above, the hotel is locate just about a mile and a half from old town san diego where there are plenty of quality restaurant to visit, not to mention the history of old town.[SEP]we had a rental car and decided to tour the harbor sights.[SEP]the ride from the hotel to the harbor was only about 20 minutes.[SEP]the hotel staff, as busy as they were, were alway polite, helpful, and attentive.[SEP]should we ever return to san diego, i would love to stay here.
2 10	march 5-march 9, 2005 i was pleasantly surprised when i drove upto the hotel.[SEP]a six story pink building in a southwest theme.[SEP]grounds are in top shape.[SEP]nice palm laden pool area with good sunlight exposure.[SEP]the room was big, king size bed, full bath / shower also had a fridge, small cocktail sink, coffee maker, a zillion tv channels and movies.[SEP]i left my room everyday around 7 am for golf, upon my return room was made up by the maid service.[SEP]a lounge and seperate resturant on site.[SEP]the front desk had a lovely young lady named lindsey, she knew all you would ever need to know of the area.[SEP]an airport shuttle service is available, plus they will drive you to any of the area resturants, malls, golf clubs within 5 miles of hotel.[SEP]i can not give it anymore than a 2 - 1/2 stars beacuse it just a nice hotel, it needs to be updated with newer rugs and furnishing.[SEP]no bells and whistles here just a clean room in a good area.[SEP]i will go back again.
7	hotel in an ideal location to take an early morning eurostar from st pancras to lille.[SEP]but that's about it.[SEP]exterior of the building promises some hope which is quickly dispelled once you're inside and in reception.[SEP]tired seventies would best describe the decor, but fine if you like orange.[SEP]designed by someone with a passion for doors as you may lose count how many you go through before reaching your room.[SEP]darkish corridors with low energy lighting might win prizes for the climate changing brigade but won't inspire a welcome in the hillsides.[SEP]if that doesn't put you off the rooms certainly will (unless, of course, you don't mind paper thin walls and late night revellers trolling around in the rooms above and below you.[SEP]wow, we didn't think hotels like this still existed in the capital, but to be absolutely fair, the beds were clean and the telly worked.[SEP]breakfast was, how shall we say, not bountiful?[SEP]edible, yes - but satisfying, well, we've had worse (but not often).[SEP]to summarise, it's handy for the stations - but so is age concern which is on the same street.[SEP]put the kettle on ma, we're on our way back home...
12	let me start with the reception.[SEP]i would say sluggish and dumb guys who did not have their good sleep.[SEP]not at all warm reception.[SEP]ok next you need in a room is drinking water.[SEP]i called for a bottle the price was too high, if i remember correctly, more than a beer can.[SEP]so i asked why not complimentary water or other option they said you can drink bathroom tap water.[SEP]i scolded him left and right and told that is not the water i drink.[SEP]next comes food, there were restaurants but whenever i needed the lights were off, so for me there was no food, no water, nobody to respond for service, what else do you expect in a hotel?[SEP]location?[SEP]ok its near raffles square which is slightly up market so if you are a conservative shopper you need to try little india, bougis junction, china town etc.[SEP]which nothing is close to this place.[SEP]for the same price you'll get lot of good options in singapore.[SEP]don't go by the star rating it has, its not worth it.
4 4 4	if you are thinking about staying here do yourself a favor and don't.[SEP]i stayed at this hotel once last year and i remember complaining about the a / c..[SEP]they had told me back then that it was a temporary thing.[SEP]when i recently stayed there in june paying around $420.00/night the a / c was practically nonexistent.... it was ridiculously hot in the rooms.[SEP]the staff was not helpful at all and you can see obvious signs wear and tear around the hotel... (ex exposed sockets, peeling wallpaper..). and the icing on the cake was when i saw a happy little cockroach roaming around the room... even if they gave me a free room i wouldn't stay there..
2	ca n’t say enough good things about the elan hotel.[SEP]stayed there nov 17 – 20 in a “ junior suite ”.[SEP]the room was comfortable, very clean, and spacious.[SEP]the staff was extremely friendly and helpful.[SEP]there as a continental breakfast in the morning and wine and cheese in the evenings.[SEP]we would not hesitate to stay at the elan in the future.[SEP]other items noteworthy, the hotel is across the street from a 24 hour restaurant and a taco bell.[SEP]not the best, but will do in a pinch if you get hungry late at night.[SEP]the hotel is a block walk from the beverly center which is a huge shopping mall.[SEP]in the other direction, you ’re less than a miles walk to the farmers market.[SEP]we even walked home from rodeo drive which was a little over 2 miles.[SEP]another plus is that the starline tours picks up at the elan every morning at 8:35am and returns you when your tour is over.[SEP]again, do n’t think you can beat the quality for the price.
7	we booked 2 rooms for my son's 21st birthday.[SEP]in one room the electronic greeting worked (tv, lights on, curtains open) but the other didn't.[SEP]no big deal, it was cool but didn't make or break the stay.[SEP]wireless worked sometimes but wired never did.[SEP]we didn't bother to call because it wasn't a big deal to us.[SEP]my husband uses a cpap machine and there is no place to plug it in, plugs behind the bed.[SEP]the staff brought us an extension cord.[SEP]the rooms were clean except for the windows which were filthy dirty.[SEP]we could barely see our " city view ".[SEP]our reservation included 2 free buffet per room but somehow wasn't applied correctly requiring a trip back to the front desk.[SEP]the buffet was great.[SEP]i would pay full price for it.[SEP]except for one dealer, a front desk person and a taxi stand attendant everyone working here seems to hate their jobs.[SEP]very few smiles or warmth outside the standard script.[SEP]my son really wanted to go to the nightclub but was intimidated by the line and attitude of the bouncers.[SEP]looked pretty much like if you didn't have a group of barely clothed women with you, you weren't getting in.[SEP]the only other thing worth noting is that it was difficult to keep our room cool and the elevators and halls were roasting [ -- ] hot.[SEP]i would hate to stay here in the summer if it is this bad in february.
2 7	no doubt the location is excellent.[SEP]it's right on the piccadilly and central lines on the tube, and right next to the british museum.[SEP]however once you walk inside the place, you realize how run down it is.[SEP]i wasn't under any impression that this would be a nice place.[SEP]for how much it costs, i know i shouldn't expect much.[SEP]but i did not it was going to be that bad.[SEP]i've stayed in old dorms and they are 25x nicer.[SEP]the bathrooms are gross and moldy.[SEP]this place needs some serious renovation.[SEP]on another good note besides the location, the staff was helpful.
0 2	plus... location, staff, front - desk, good coffee on each floor, nice open views if you are on front side of the hotel.[SEP]quiet.[SEP]minus... tiny rooms (even by ny standards and for what they charge), totally not suitable for business traveler (despite free wifi) because there is but one open electric socket, not desk, a small table that is very uncomfortable to use because of low chair, no newspaper on floor or for room (a few on the front desk).[SEP]so for the money they charge, not really worth it.
1 1	we stayed here for just 1 day during our trip (wish we had stayed longer!).[SEP]it is a very nice hotel, spacious room and very comfy bed![SEP]we used our points (and my husband is platinum) so breakfast was included... it was amazing![SEP]you could eat this and be ok til dinner.[SEP]one thing, the hotel staff was not as knowledgeable about what to do or how to get places and the concierge was always busy.[SEP]but it might have been the time of day / year.
0 5 14 19	love the fountains and will be back again... but... will request the old style rooms.[SEP]did not enjoy being in building 10 as it was too far away from the club house and pools.[SEP]also we were facing the main road and it was noisy most of the night out our bedroom window.[SEP]did not like the new style / decorated rooms.[SEP]the 2nd bedroom is a little smaller.[SEP]the master has a beautiful shower basically right in the middle fo the bedroom with no way to take a shower in the mornign without waking up your partner.[SEP]also no towel bar near the shower![SEP]weird.[SEP]the light for the shower area illuminates the entire bedroom, also waking your partner unnecessarily.[SEP]the master bath was huge beyond need.[SEP]the garden tub is in there but not in the main sleeping area as in the old style where you could relax and watch tv or watch tv while the kids bathed.[SEP]too bad.[SEP]main living area is a little smaller too which was a shame.[SEP]not enough room to sit at the dining table as it was too cramped into the space.[SEP]still love having the washer and dryer and kitchen was stocked perfectly.[SEP]we liked the interior access to the room vs.[SEP]the outside access at our other visits in bldgs.[SEP]5 and 2 but would take exterior entrance to get back the other amenities of bigger living space and more sensible master.[SEP]overall, will just request older style rooms going forward and try to get closer to the club house and indoor pool.[SEP]still an awesome stay overall.
1	we moved to this resort after a week at vacation villages at parkway.[SEP]we were very disappointed by the run - down appearance and lack of cleanliness of the first building and room we were given.[SEP]the building needed to be repainted and the plantings were dead or dying.[SEP]the carpet in the unit was very stained and worn.[SEP]i asked to be moved to another unit and was told that they were all similar because the resort was due for it's first update and renovation.[SEP]i was given a unit in a building closer to the front of the resort and it was better.[SEP]the floor was tile instead of stained carpet which made a big difference.[SEP]the staff was very helpful throughout our stay and i would say that they are the resorts biggest asset at this point.[SEP]my kids also enjoyed the pool and kids' craft / activity center.
3	my wife found half - eaten leftover food in the room upon check - in.[SEP]we asked for a non - smoking room and it reeked of cigarette smoke.[SEP]front - desk staff stonewalled us about changing rooms until 3 pm the next day, even after speaking with the manager about the unacceptable room they gave us.[SEP]why stay at a hotel this dirty and without any reasonable response for a change in room?
1	great resort?no don't joke......[SEP]big apartments with old furniture, no service at all, not clean, no restaurant, great location but a very cheap hotel.[SEP]old swimming pool area, very very little gym, old sheets on bed and 8 days without a changing...
13	as previous travelers have mentioned, this hotel is perfectly located at the end of duval street and next to mallory square.[SEP]if you are looking to stay in the heart of key west this is the place to be.[SEP]all of the shops and bars are very close & within walking distance.[SEP]the hotel is not 5 star, however it is fun and colorful with fresh paint and interesting artwork.[SEP]we had a large room with vaulted ceilings & a skylight.[SEP]the patio had a beautiful view overlooking mallory square and the ocean, perfect for watching the famous key west sunsets.[SEP]the formal restaurant, hot tin roof, sits on the edge of the property overlooking the water.[SEP]the food is delicious, however the service was rather slow.[SEP]sunset pier is more lively with good music and a more " pub - like " menu.[SEP]it gets crowded at sunset so get there early to get a good seat and enjoy the tasty drinks.[SEP]the only negative for this hotel was the noise in the morning.[SEP]we like fresh air so we opened our patio door during the night.[SEP]the roosters in mallory square are extremely loud in the early morning so be sure to turn the a / c on instead of opening the door![SEP]all in all we loved this hotel and will stay again for our annual trip to the key west.
3 3 5	i have avoided writing a review of my harrowing visit to hotel 65, but the fact i am still paying the price for this visit has left me with no choice but to warn others.[SEP]i wasn't keen on staying here as i believe in comfort over budget but our friends booked it and of course, the price seemed reasonable.[SEP]the hotel is all you'd expect for its price range: cramped, poorly furnished and basic.[SEP]what i hadn't expected was the following: horror number 1: my partner found a white plastic contraption under the bed with " pest control " written on it.[SEP]clearly the hotel expected " visitors " in our room.[SEP]it seems they weren't wrong... horror number 2: i woke, went to the shower room and discovered to my horror that i had a large number of red bites all over on my stomach.[SEP]you will know what these were without me spelling it out.[SEP]three weeks on and the bites have not gone away.[SEP]only antihistamines will make them go down and they are now scarring.[SEP]please, i really do recommend you keep well away from this place.
1 3	this motel was in very poor shape.[SEP]rooms were filty and smelled.[SEP]i would not recommend this to another person or family passing thru the town.[SEP]towels were left in the shower which was an indication that the bathroom was not even cleaned from previous occupant.[SEP]how gross is that![SEP]i couldn't wait to leave!![SEP]no recommendated at all.[SEP]the price of it says it all:(
4	based on a number of reviews i had read this hotel seemed to offer exactly what we were looking for.[SEP]in common with other reviews, i would say it is in a great (quiet) location and is easy to find by venice standards.[SEP]however, the hotel itself was a big disappointment.[SEP]the rooms are tiny - there is about 2 ft clearance around the bed, our floor was sloping and the bathroom was absolutely tiny.[SEP]there was also mold on the rim of the shower.[SEP]there were a number of mosquitoes in the room which we had to swat.[SEP]we had to check out early in the morning and they couldn't offer us breakfast since the waiter didn't come in until 7:30.[SEP]there is also no staff on at night - you must ring the hotel across the square.[SEP]while the staff are very nice and friendly, i really couldn't recommend this hotel to anyone.
5	hyatt dorado always brings good memories to me.... i have been there a few times and loved staying there.[SEP]the check is fast and efficient.... we did nt like our room the first time and it was promptly changed.[SEP]the second room was nice and spacious with a great balcony and beautiful ocean view.[SEP]one of my favorite things about this place was the pool and of course the pool bar.... drinks were delicious and the endless platano chip bowl seemed endless.[SEP]the location was nice... very quiet area, yet easily accessible by car and short drive away from both rincon and san juan.[SEP]overall, i would recommend this hotel for a couple who wants a romantic getaway but i am sure that anyone who stays there will enjoy it
8	i called the hotel directly to make the reservation and discussed the fact we would need a room for four of us, two adults and two pre - teens.[SEP]i specifically requested guarantee for late arrival.[SEP]our flight was delayed and we arrived in the middle of the night.[SEP]at first the desk clerk said they didn't have a room for us at all.[SEP]then he found one for us.[SEP]when we went up to the room we found that it had one bed.[SEP]we waited quite a while for a rollaway from housekeeping.[SEP]the next day we had to pack up and leave our bags to be moved while we were sightseeing, and did get a room with two beds.[SEP]the rooms were dusty and not oversized.[SEP]on the upside, the views were nice.[SEP]members of the wait staff in the lobby restaurant were very friendly and helpful at breakfast and tried to cheer up four jet - lagged, grumpy midwesterners.
4	this newer hotel met the standards expected of a pan pacific.[SEP]we stayed here for three weekend nights at a rate of $183 found on orbitz.[SEP]the hotel is located just north of downtown and on the edge of the south lake union neighborhood.[SEP]there is a whole foods in the building and a spa / health club across the driveway circle.[SEP]our room was average sized but had new furnishings, quality bathroom fixtures and a comfortable bed (however i prefer the new beds found at marriott and westin).[SEP]there was a large flat screen television and floor to ceiling windows (we had close up views of the condos across the driveway so you need to close the blinds for privacy).[SEP]the staff was very friendly even though we had no special requests.[SEP]there is free internet access in the lobby and a bar which we did not take advantage of on this trip.[SEP]there is street parking in the neighborhood, which was practical for us but may be a hassle if you are planning on leaving the car for extended periods as the spots are metered.[SEP]the health club across the way was of decent size and there was no charge which was a pleasant surprise.[SEP]the main drawback from our perspective was the bathroom, which had a sliding wooden door that faced the living room (you can watch tv from the tub if you wish) -- doesn't allow for that much privacy if you are traveling with a companion.
0	this hotel is a nice one - nice big room, quiet, good value, service was good, etc..[SEP]etc... no complaints on those items really.[SEP]however, be aware (1) it's a bit dull / boring (lacks any of the fun, energetic vibe of the real resorts) (2) a fairly long walk to the mgm grand (~10 mins) across a bunch of dingy 80s - era people movers (3) it's really hard to get a cab here on fri or sat nights (4) that you don't have access to things like wet republic at the mgm (you will need to pay extra) (5) the gym sucks and you'll have to pay the $25/day to work out at the mgm gym if you are (like me) a serious gym rat.[SEP](6) business center ($1/min for a poor - quality internet) was highway robbery.[SEP]b / c of the above we prob.[SEP]wouldn't stay here again, its not the vegas experience we look for, but its good value.
1	went to vegas w / my hubby, his parents, my parents, and his sister and brother - in - law.[SEP]we all absolutely loved it.[SEP]it is on the corner across from new york, new york, mgm grand, and another one whose name escapes me at the moment.[SEP]perfect place to stay on the strip because you are at the end.[SEP]not a far walk from the bellagio, caesar's, etc.[SEP]the rooms were immaculate, the casino was nice, as was the pool.[SEP]staff was all super friendly, and the rates were awesome.[SEP]the eateries left a little to be desired, but you get what you pay for at buffet time.[SEP]can't wait to go back again:)
3 13 14	we are owners at marriott's grande vista, a true 5-star resort.[SEP]we've been to orlando several times and decided to try a different resort.[SEP]that's where we made our mistake.[SEP]liki tiki is run down, old, dirty and grimy.[SEP]low class guests abound.[SEP]the " waterpark " is small and always crowded.[SEP]my 9 yr old wasn't thrilled and my 6 and 2 yr old had a good time.[SEP]my husband and i were miserable.[SEP]we had an incident when a group of young guests tried to steal my son's swimming goggles, even though my son was yelling at them not to take them, i had to run after them to get them back![SEP]the only positive was that the front desk was accomodating to our requests.[SEP]when we first checked in they were going to put us in one of the old villas.[SEP]i had called 6 months in advance requesting a new unit.[SEP]they were completetly booked but the rep managed to get us into a 2br unite in the new 1200 building.[SEP]the room was fine, except for the stench of cigarette smoke coming from the adjoining studio.[SEP]it's a sham, this is not a 5 star resort.[SEP]don't waste your time.
1	we stayed at the hyatt regency when we were in town for the miami marathon.[SEP]the rooms were nice and clean, but nothing overly spectacular.[SEP]the front desk staff were friendly and professional and happily placed me on a high floor, at my request.[SEP]we were offered a 40 dollar meal certificate to be used at the hotel restaurant because we booked using a aaa discount.[SEP]by the way... ask for the aaa discount because it will also give you 40 dollars off the going rate (at least it did at the time we booked).[SEP]the swordfish and steak at the hotel restaurant were very very good![SEP]in fact, that was the best swordfish that i have ever had![SEP]we would have stayed in the hotel for a second night, but they were booked ;-) the only negative that i can say about the hotel is that the self parking is a bit of a pain.[SEP]though, cost - wise, 12 dollars to park in downtown miami is not too bad.[SEP]oh, and wifi costs 10 dollars and is not free in the lobby or business center.
7	my partner and i stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in november 2010.[SEP]we were back - packing for 4 months and it certainly wasn't the worst accommodation we had stayed in.[SEP]although it is in the red light district, we did not see anything seedy![SEP]the location was good, within walking distance to the kallang mrt station and cheap travel into the main attractions.[SEP]there is a good chinese restaurant located at the end of the road from the hotel, with some funny karaoke going on![SEP]the hotel is lit up like a christmas tree outside and you can't miss it, although i would recommend getting directions before arriving![SEP]the internet was $1 for 15 minutes.[SEP]however there were a few negative points: the room was tiny and we found lots black hairs all around the room.[SEP]also, there was no hot water.[SEP]we wanted to extend our stay for a night and were told we couldn't do this as they had no rooms available so we would have to pay a higher rate.[SEP]we weren't happy with this so paid to use the internet service there and booked another room of the same description at the same rate we originally paid, and we got to keep the same room so think they were just trying to con us out of money!
0	exalibur is great, widescreen rooms are clean and comfortable and the hotel had everything we needed, nice casino and great places to eat at baja fresh and dicks last resort.[SEP]the free monorail to the luxor and mandalay bay is really handy too.[SEP]this was ourd first trip to vegas and were happy with our choice.[SEP]the only downsides is that the rooms do not have a frig, micro or coffeemaker.[SEP]they also do not have wireless internet, which was annoying.[SEP]the daily resort fee is too much given that they don't have internet.[SEP]also, beware the staff that tries to give you free tickets to shows, they only want you to spend a whole day viewing their timeshares.[SEP]this is very annoying as they stop you everytime you walk to the elevators.other than that it was a nice adorable place and we will probably go back.
0 3	staff was professional and courteous, high level of cleanliness and tidiness, clean quality linens.[SEP]rooms are a bit dated but fuctional.[SEP]only complaint is the bed was a bit worn out.[SEP]nothing special, but a decent and clean place to sleep.[SEP]good value.
3 3	picked this hotel based on cost and previous reviews.[SEP]we was not disappointed.[SEP]the location is ideal being only 2 blocks from grand central station and in easy walking distance of many of main attractions.[SEP]clean throughout, towels changed daily, staff helpful, good size room but bathroom dated and in need of decoartion - but hey it was clean and acceptable.[SEP]didn't have a view but what do you want for your money - we were out most of the day & night.[SEP]nice to be able to open windows and get some fresh air.[SEP]summary - a good well positioned hotel at attractive rates.
3	we loved our stay.[SEP]they offer very personalized service.[SEP]kids are important guests to them also.[SEP]our room was beautiful.[SEP]some of the best customer service i have ever received at a hotel.
5	i have time sharing at marriott cypress harbour in orlando but i changed my week this year to this special resort![SEP]great idea![SEP]its a resort with the marriott quality like the others but i think this is more luxurious or newer.[SEP]its in the area that i know, close to sea world, aquatica and discovery cove region.[SEP]having car you can reach to many options for buying food -cvs, walgreens and publix or you can have in the resort a quick option of market.[SEP]the ice cream sold at the light house is marvelous once i had breakfast at the restaurant (seated and served one) nikis grill - very good the villas (i stayed in a two bedroom villa) is great... huge space, clean, well decorated.[SEP]the one i stayed had views for the lake.... the staff is sympa and the pools are great too.
9	i chose this hotel because it was good value in a good location.[SEP]however that is where the good points end.[SEP]on the first morning we were there my partner left a tiffany ring in the bathroom, which had been stolen by the time we got back later in the afternoon.[SEP]we reported the theft immediately and the duty manager informed us that all the cleaners had gone for the day but they would deal with it in the morning.[SEP]we heard nothing the next day and when we checked with reception were told that the note on the system said that there was' never a ring in the room'.[SEP]after speaking to the manager they informed us they would check the lock log and cctv.[SEP]when we returned that evening we were informed by another duty manager that they had questioned the cleaner and that they didn't think the ring had been stolen as the cleaner' had worked there a long time', basically accusing us of not telling the truth.[SEP]we spoke to the actual manager the next day and he had exactly the same attitude![SEP]all in all it was a terrible first stay there but at luck would have it we ended up back there via a' secret hotel' deal online that could not be cancelled.[SEP]this time we would not let anyone in the room so nothing was taken but the room itself was very poor for the price.[SEP]i have attached a picture of the bathroom ceiling.[SEP]i would avoid this place at all costs.
5 5	at 3 pm i waited over 25 miniutes for an unapoligetic clerk who simply said he was tending to something upstairs.[SEP]my room was far below what was advertised on expedia.com.[SEP]i was told i was being upgraded to room 419.[SEP]the place was so noisey at 5 am garbage trucks empty endless trash bins located right below my window.[SEP]the breakfast was mediocare not a continental breakfast but rater a boxed muffin and juice with cut fruit that was obviously not refrigerated![SEP]this place is poorly managed the room was filthy sand everywhere i couldn't go barefoot in my own room, the kitchenette was disgusting the dishes and flatware were greesy and there were roaches everywhere even in the shower.
1 6 8	my husband and i stayed here for 2 nights during the last week of july.[SEP]we had planned to stay longer but after an issue with ants in 3 rooms over 2 nights, we had enough and checked out.[SEP]ants can happen anywhere but obviously there is a porblem at this " resort " since we were moved 3x and still no relief.[SEP]on the first night with the ants, our room was sprayed and we were assured the problem was gone.[SEP]not true, so another spraying and we could barely breath upon entering the room, due to the overwhelming fumes from whatever was used to kill the ants.[SEP]far from paradise.[SEP]overall, besides ants, we did not find rooms very clean - very dirty floors, previous guests towels hanging on the back of the door in the bathroom, housekeeping needs a wake up call.[SEP]will not be back and will not recommend.[SEP]for the prices you pay here, pest free and cleanliness should be a given.
3	we stayed at the holiday inn new orleans french quarter in late april 2012.[SEP]the rooms and hotel did not meet my expectations.[SEP]the property is tired and worn out.[SEP]my room had trash behind the furniture, rips in the carpet, wallpaper coming off the wall, no toilet lid, dirty tub and sink and a 110 volt out in the bath that was non functional.[SEP]i noticed a piece of apple in the corner of the elevator the day i checked in and it was still there 3 days later when i checked out.[SEP]this property is a cash cow and is always rented so they really don't have to improve it.[SEP]i should have spent a little extra money to stay at the weston, sheraton or the hilton.[SEP]live and learn.
0 2	downtown hotel but old and musty we recently stayed at this hotel as part of a package after our cruise that included a 2 night stay at this hotel.[SEP]after reading some of the reviews prior to leaving, i was a little worried.[SEP]we arrived and the room was disgusting and had a very musty smell.[SEP]we checked for bed bugs after reading some previous reviews and found none.[SEP]the matress appeared to be fairly new.[SEP]we were on the 9th floor.[SEP]my sisters room was actually worse than ours.[SEP]i have never stayed at a place before that i had to wear my beach shoes in the shower.[SEP]i must say, it is in a very convenient location but quite a few female escorts if you know what i mean all in the hotel area.[SEP]there were about 50 of us on this tour package and on our way home everyone was discussing the rooms.[SEP]apparently, some rooms were quite nice and renovated and others had similar comments to ours.[SEP]my suggestion would be to check your room and if it is not renovated and similar to what i have listed above, request another room.[SEP]i wish i had known this information when i arrived.[SEP]i just assumed the entire hotel had not been renovated.
3	i will start off by saying that i am a hilton honors diamond member and have stayed at other conrads and so i review this conrad from that perspective.[SEP]the conrad in chicago used to be a le meridian and they have changed nothing from those days it seems.[SEP]they are in the process of remodeling but at present it is still the same.[SEP]the rooms, bits and pieces are a bit tired, the shower had a couple of cracked tiles and seemed quite frankly a bit dirty.[SEP]the service is ok, the concierge is the best part of the hotels service, quick attentive, knowledgeable.[SEP]many of these small things you would forgive if it were just a hilton, but not a conrad and the prices they charge.[SEP]the staff at this hotel need to go and spend a few days at the singapore conrad and learn how a conrad should be run.[SEP]until then it is a tarted up hilton.
0	spent time here in march with gate 1 travel ; the rooms are fairly small, the beds are comfy and the bathroom was more than adequate.[SEP]the problem was that the central heat was on and you can not turn it off.[SEP]we did open our windows that make the temperature tolerable.[SEP]these turks seem cold natured ; the hotels could save themselves money on letting patrons turn off the heat.[SEP]the breakfast was adequate and the location of the hotel is really good ; just three blocks from the tram which will take you to most places you will want to see.[SEP]ask for a room that does not face the street.... it seems to be noiser at night than in the day time, and if you want to open your windows.... well, you get the picture.[SEP]i do highly recommend gate 1 tour to turkey ; it was inexpensive, comprehensive and lots of fun.[SEP]we had a great guide, neco, who was a literal encyclopedia of turkish history.[SEP]turkey is a wonderful country with really nice people.
1	stayed in this hotel as part of honeymoon trip to usa, had disaster stay in paramount new york but sheraton made up for it, welcomed by friendly reception staff who asked us reason for visit when we told them for honeymoon put us in king room on top floor of hotel overlooking city, room was very big with the most comfortable hotel bed i've ever slept in, went for walk in beautiful surrounding backbay and on return had found champagne, chocolate covered strawberries and congratulations card from hotel.[SEP]i would recommend this hotel highly, right next door to shopping mall and short distance from main shopping streets and sight seeing trolleys leave from front door could not fault this hotel
1 2	stayed here in february with my mom and sister in law.[SEP]i don't know if the problem was just on our floor, but everyday we had some issue with the cleanness of the room.[SEP]waste baskets wouldn't be emptied, the room wasn't cleaned once, no towels or soap would be left.[SEP]we complained a couple of times and got really average service at the front desk.[SEP]we asked for extra towels one day and took over 1 hr to bring them.[SEP]the rooms are really not very welcoming, feel very cold and dull.[SEP]beds are comfortable, and noise wasn't an issue as it is off the french quarter.[SEP]we asked to upgrade as we weren't very fond of the room, and were very confused when we went into the room since there was a present for some guy there, a little cake.[SEP]apparently he didn't like the room either and changed, but they still delivered the cake to the old room.[SEP]while we were on the phone trying to change rooms, we were told by the front desk there are rooms with no windows, so make sure you ask, unless you like that kind of thing.[SEP]the location is pretty good, as you get quiet but at the same time you are steps away from the action.[SEP]breakfast was ok.[SEP]all in all, it was just an ok stay, nothing memorable.[SEP]if i ever go back to new orleans i would probably like to try something else.
0	i am still really upset about my experience at the bentley hotel in new york a couple of weeks ago.[SEP]i arrived the evening of the superbowl, that is a sunday around 6 pm.[SEP]i innocently asked the young woman at the front desk if she could give us a nice room, as i had my wife with me and i knew that the hotel was famed for its views.[SEP]she gave me room number 201, which is the worst room in the hotel with no window.[SEP]the' window' was blacked out since immediately outside was the hotel air conditioning unit.[SEP]i will try to atach photos.[SEP]at check in the receptionist had told me that she' could not change the room as i was part of a group' clearly this was nonsense and the hotel was clearly far from full.[SEP]i don't know why some, thankfully few, people in one's travels are so nasty.[SEP]probably she is unhappy, unless i was meant to slip her a few dollars for such a request, in which case i may be just naive.[SEP]i have traveled all over the world, and i was sorry to disappoint my wife who seldom accompanies me.[SEP]i would have complained to the hotel but i can't seem to find a site one can contact.[SEP]i will try to post the pictures.[SEP]this type of dirty trick does the hotel great harm.
5	i sure wish that i would have read the other reviews of this place before i booked it.[SEP]i should have been suspicious when i saw the orbitz rate of $39 ; however i've had good luck at several other days inns so i just thought that i was getting a good deal.[SEP]was i wrong.[SEP]we arrived at about 11:30 p.m. after a long (and very hot day at sea world) and a visit to some old neighbors in windermere.[SEP]the check - in is located in a strip mall and the area is a bit seedy, imho.[SEP]the room was relatively clean (thank goodness), however it was in serious need of a paint job and new carpet.[SEP]the paint in the bathroom was peeling (about a 2x2 foot area was stripped to the drywall) and several other walls were pretty badly scuffed.[SEP]at least the air conditioner was working.[SEP]we had a decent night's sleep but were extremely glad to leave early the next morning to go to discovery cove.
1	stayed at the hotel sultania for 9 nights in january.[SEP]the hotel is wonderful, exceptionally clean and the staff are extremely friendly and helpful.[SEP]the hotel is well placed to see all the sights of istanbul.[SEP]you have a tram stop only a few hundred metres away or you could easily walk to some of the major sights such as hagia sophia, blue mosque or the cistern (even when snowing!).[SEP]the room was spotless, and extremely well maintained and very quiet.[SEP]the buffet breakfast is excellent with a fantastic selection of both turkish and western cuisine.[SEP]as it got dark early we also ate at the hotel bistro (which is also the breakfast room) and the quality of food and service was excellent (must try the turkish coffee or the turkish apple tea at breakfast).[SEP]hotel room service is food from the bistro (just a smaller menu), however the food quality and serving size is just like the bistro.[SEP]whilst i didn't try the hamam, the massages on offer were excellent.[SEP]the hamam / fitness area is also extremely well maintained and a lovely place to relax after a long day of sight seeing.[SEP]special mention must go to a few staff who made our stay very special - baris (bistro), murat (breakfast & bistro), irina (best massage ever) and vedat (lobby cleaner).[SEP]we would definitely stay at the hotel sultania again without hesitation and would highly recommend this hotel.
3	the entrance hall stinks of cigarrettes but the " hotelier " declared it a non - smoking hotel.[SEP]the carpets have seen better days - about 20 years ago - and the rooms do not appear to have any on - suite facilities which, for the price, should be the very least on offer.[SEP]in the room there was a desk, not one angle is either vertical or horizontal and looks as though it was constructed by a seven year old.[SEP]the " decor " is about as old as the carpets with missing pieces of paint all around the windows and doors.[SEP]the " wardrobe " doors did not fit and were wedged shut - not that i would leave anything in them.[SEP]you could hear every movement through the floor below and ceiling above.[SEP]not a recipe for a restfull nights sleep.[SEP]average of £ 124 per night without en - suite or breakfast is far too much for what amounts to a very run down has been hotel.
1	we needed a place to stay for one night after our cruise and after extensive research i chose this hotel.[SEP]the staff was friendly the room clean and roomy.[SEP]they allowed us to check in early and called up after we settled in and asked if we were happy with our room.[SEP]that s a first![SEP]the only problem i had was in the morning before we left i could not get the printer in the business area to work to print out our airline tickets to fly out.[SEP]if i had it to do over again i would have done it the night before so i would have had time to get help to get them printed but we got out with out any problems.[SEP]after we got home i realized that we accidentally forgot our sonicare toothbrush in the bathroom.[SEP]i called them and they had found it and i gave them my credit card to send it to us which they promptly did.[SEP]highly recommend!
0	this hotel, in a business building on the fourth floor is very clean, modern and near the via veneto's many restaurants and shops.[SEP]the friendly and helpful service from owner and manager, alessandro and his staff and family was outstanding.[SEP]his suggestions for dinner were excellent.[SEP]the room was typcally small but very efficient.[SEP]there was no breakfast room so we ordered breakfast the night before and it was delivered to our room on time.[SEP]the breakfast was excellent.
5	despite being only a block from bourbon st., this hotel is quiet and peaceful.[SEP]the courtyard with a little pool and loungers with towels is a blissful oasis of green amid the busy city.[SEP]i really have no complaints about this hotel-- i stayed for four nights for a conference.[SEP]my room was huge.[SEP]the free wireless worked well.[SEP]decor was normal, but the rooms were clean, and the heat / cooling actually worked.[SEP]staff was accommodating and pleasant.
1 2	location is good for those seeking for airport proximity.[SEP]however, the hotel is in really bad shape and needs to be renewed.[SEP]bedroom and bathroom looked old, tired and a dirty.[SEP]no wifi, but they had a free wired internet connection, although no cables were available in room, front desk had a spare one to borrow, but it was the last one.[SEP]i highly recommend to bring your own![SEP]it was ok for a one night stay, but it wasn't worthy the 100 euros i payed.[SEP]next stay will pay the extra buck and stay at the renaissance close by.
1	my wife and i stayed there 5 mights.[SEP]room was very retro and very nice.[SEP]what impressed us most was the exercise room... fantastic![SEP]staff was friendly and prices surprisingly affordable.
0 8	the place is beautiful, great rooms, fabulous pool, and close to disney, islands of adventure, seaworld, everything.[SEP]rooms range up to 3br units that are very family friendly and nicely decorated.[SEP]each unit has a nice screen potch and each unit above studio has a full kitchen.[SEP]lots of activities (from beer tasting to ice cream socials to exercise classes to a kids scuba primer) multiple pools, main pool is beautiful, with a terrific poolside bar.[SEP]located off trolley route (or reasonable cab or car) to tons of restaurants and the best of orlando.[SEP]we bought a hilton grand vacations timeshare because of this place - and love it.[SEP]the staff is friendly and helpful, there is handy deli / market on site - making it easy to supply if you prepare meals in your unit.[SEP]publix is handy across the street too.[SEP]if you are headed to orlando, this is the place to stay.
0 2	i love everything about this resort, people go out of their way to make sure you are happy.[SEP]the whole experience was very positive, the restaurant has delicious food all day long.[SEP]the pools and hot tubs clean, lots of towels everywhere you look.[SEP]nice cabanas.[SEP]i am looking forward to go back some day.[SEP]shuttle to lahaina is is free almost every hour.
3 5	first of all i would like to say about the location of best western premier opera diamond.[SEP]it's just perfect.[SEP]wherever you will go it takes 15 minutes.[SEP]second - it's really clear, new, modern and big rooms including wi - fi.[SEP]all staff very friendly.[SEP]very nice hotel.
1 3	my husband and i just spent two nights at the grand hotel francais, and we could not have been happier with our choice.[SEP]in many ways, the hotel has exceeded our expectation: the price was within our budget, breakfast was included, and the staff was friendly, helpful and fluent in english.[SEP]as other travelers have mentioned, the hotel is close to the nation metro station, which makes it easy to get around.[SEP]the room size was just enough to fit two people, but we had a comfortable stay throughout.[SEP]overall, the hotel lives up to its high trip advisor rating.[SEP]we would love to stay here again anytime.
1 1	we stayed for one night after the flight from sydney and then flight to east coast.[SEP]old hotel, worn out carpets, bathrooms are very small.[SEP]2 double beds rooms are on the street side (we were on last 10th floor and still noise was coming from the traffic, king size bed on another side into courtyard).[SEP]security guard in the lobby gets you feeling that this is not a safe area.[SEP]this was also the worst breakfast from all the hotels i did travel in usa, orange juice tasted like water, no microwave oven.[SEP]forget about mc next door homeless people only take out do not eat in.[SEP]danny's is 7 - 8 minutes walk also food is terrible.[SEP]the only bright spot is the internet caffe across the street, good food - but please cross the street on light only.[SEP]we were ok for one night, but there is no way i would stay here for a extended vacation time or with kids.
3 4	some friends visited from the states but had a difficult time finding a room.[SEP]this place had an opening so we booked it.[SEP]for a cheap hotel in london it wasn't bad... but compared to what they were used to it did not fit their standards.[SEP]the carpet was very worn as was the furniture in the room.[SEP]their room was in the basement and was very musty and dusty.[SEP]it was also tiny![SEP]but the sheets and bathroom were clean and the loo worked just fine.
0	terrible restaurant, dirty, cheapest beds, little sleep and backache, small rooms, very rude sttaff, tiny bath, the worst $30 motel 6 is better.[SEP]who cares about location when you can' sleep!![SEP]had 3 rooms for 9 nights at about $7,000.[SEP]a rip off even for new york.[SEP]there are much better hotels within a block at the same price.
2	i stayed at hotel keppler since i could use frequent flier miles, and the reviews of tripadvisor.[SEP]i'm so glad i did ; i loved the hotel.[SEP]the staff were fantastic, the room small but very nice, the public spaces all elegant without being too fussy or antiquated.[SEP]the hotel is on a very quiet street and allows an amazing night's sleep.[SEP]i will return to this hotel for sure.
2	the location was probably the best thing about it, however the hotel was extremely basic.[SEP]the room which i stayed in had a certain stench about it, and also the service was not up to scratch - including an employee, not knocking before entering the room.[SEP]it was just somewhere to sleep mainly, but extremely basic.
6	this is a wonderfully unique hotel, with the most helpful staff i have ever encountered in a hotel -- in paris or elsewhere.[SEP]it is on a quiet street, and is about a 10 minute walk from jardin du luxembourg.[SEP]the metro is a 5-minute walk, and the rer b line to the airport is a 10 minute walk.[SEP]this is a small hotel, and all of the rooms are designed in a different motif.[SEP]although the rooms are on the small side, they are not atypical for paris, and i've stayed in smaller rooms.[SEP]staff in the lobby are always welcoming, and you feel as if you're staying in a home rather than a hotel.[SEP]the rooms are comfortable, very creatively designed, and impeccably clean.[SEP]the staff are remarkably friendly and consistently helpful.[SEP]regardless of where i have to be in paris, i'd go out of my way to stay at the apostrophe hotel.
1 6	we stayed at the sheraton centre the night of july 16.[SEP]we booked the room through an on - line travel site and we were extremely disappointed.[SEP]the room was extremely small with one double bed, small bathroom with toilet against a small vanity.[SEP]when i complained about the room at the front desk, i was told " that's what i get for booking through an online site " and that the " hotel was full, and that was all that was available ".[SEP]the check in lines were also very long, and people were not happy with the slow service.[SEP]other than the $45 per night valet parking, there is no other parking on the hotel site.[SEP]safe your money, and stay somewhere else![SEP]i know i will.
4 4	i stayed for 5 nights and paid a fortune (the daily rate on my bill varied from $199, what would have been a fair rate, to the absolutely ridiculous amount of $379 per night).[SEP]yes, the location is great but if you expect a " design hotel " then you are on the wrong track.[SEP]the lobby is sort of cool but the rooms are below average standards.[SEP]i booked one of the more expensive rooms (superior queen) since i was warned that the cheapest rooms are literally the size of a shoe box.[SEP]the shower was infested with mildew but the house keeping didn't care despite a complaint.
2	location is average only - 15 minutes walk to mrt.[SEP]nothing much around that area.[SEP]room is aged but clean.
15	the hotel is right on the water at the end of duval street (a very happening street) and has a pier for drinks and watching the sunset.[SEP]our room was comfortable and the staff was very nice.[SEP]we stayed two nights and had breakfast / brunch in the room both days.[SEP]the first day we both had lox and bagel and they were great and the next morning i had a three egg cheese omlette and my wife had oatmeal with several choices of toppings.[SEP]a couple of thoughts and bonuses for the hotel.[SEP]1.[SEP]don't rent a car in kw.[SEP]everything is within walking distance or you can get a pedicab or hop off one of the sightseeing trolleys.[SEP]2.[SEP]you are right at duval, whitehead and front streets and that's where the action is, but the hotel was quiet.[SEP]3.[SEP]mallory square is next to the hotel and huge crowds gather there for the sunset and various performers.[SEP]our favorite was a so - so banjo player with his star golden retreiver named cleo that would come around and take dollar bills from several people at once and then take them over and put them in a bucket.[SEP]4.[SEP]there's a cvs right next door that has water, sodas, beer and wine and some sandwiches and it's convenient and will save you money.[SEP]will definately stay here if we ever return.
4 4	my 10 year old son and i stayed at the hotel felix for two nights while the phillies were in town.[SEP]i got a great rate on priceline.[SEP]the staff checked us in at 10 am on the day of our arrival and was permitted to check out at noon our last day.[SEP]i found the staff to be very accomodating and friendly.[SEP]room was small as stated in other reviews but it was nice.[SEP]bed was very comfortable.[SEP]our room looked over a parking lot when you looked down but i choose to look out and saw some nice views.[SEP]the location is good not great.[SEP]you are just off the action maybe four short blocks to michigan ave.[SEP]i would stay again.
6	from the moment we were greeted on check - in, this charming hotel was a wonderful experience.[SEP]the young lady behind the desk, with wonderful english and always a smile, provide help with what to see, how to get there, where to eat, etc.[SEP]the hotel is located 1 block from rue cler, the local street market.[SEP]we walked to the eiffel tower.[SEP]many places to eat nearby.[SEP]the room was small by american standards but quite comfortable.[SEP]it was spotlessly clean and well kept.[SEP]the king bed very comfortable.[SEP]the air conditioning worked fine though was hardly needed in april.[SEP]i would highly recommend this small hotel as an excellent option in paris.
3	my husband and i loves las vegas and this hotel added to our love for vegas.[SEP]this hotel was amazing.[SEP]it is a true vegas style hotel.[SEP]the room was large, clean and up to date.[SEP]the shark (aquarium) tank by the poolside was a sight to see.[SEP]we would love to spend another week at this hotel.[SEP]the price was right, however it is not on the strip, yet in the heart of old las vegas.[SEP]if you don't mind taking a 10 - 12 minute bus ride on the duce, or taxi ride to the strip.[SEP]the food was a little pricey at the hotel, there was a limited selection, yet several eatery's along the old vegas strip under the light show.[SEP]the staff at the hotel were pleasant and professional.
3	i've stayed in a lot of different hotels in paris as well as the rest of the world and i don't mind staying in shabby palces, that is if it's advertised and priced after it's standard.[SEP]this time i went with my mom and wanted to stay at a good hotel in a nice area so i choose hotel pratic, worst misstake ever.[SEP]they charged us 254 euros, without breakfast for 2 nights on the 4th floor, where builiders were working from early in the morning to quite late at night, tearing down the place, loose electrical wires etc.[SEP]our room had not been cleaned, concrete, mixed with god knows what all over the place, a tiny as bed that barly fits two.[SEP]the spreadsheet was nasty as hell, and one of us had to use it as a bed sheet during the first night, a fierce rash was the result![SEP]i would not go back here again if i was paid for it!
8	the first thing we noticed was the great location of this hotel.[SEP]as mentioned in the other reviews, only a couple of minutes from the arc de triumphe.[SEP]it is also a very short walk to the metro which, in my opinion, is the fastest and most convenient way to get around paris.[SEP]the hotel itself is very tastefully decorated.[SEP]as previously mentioned by other reviewers, the lift is tiny and a bit claustrophobic so only one person at once with the cases.[SEP]i don't usually like to mention size of rooms, but this room was particularly small.[SEP]literally, just little big bigger than the bed and not much room for our two cases.[SEP]as we were on the fifth floor, we had also had a balcony.[SEP]the room and bathroom were very tasteful and clean.[SEP]we also found the staff on reception to be very friendly and helpful with any requests we had.[SEP]the breakfast was good if you go down to the foyer level to eat (it is buffet style).[SEP]on one of the mornings, we ordered breakfast to the room and got a very small amount for the 12 euros (same price as buffet).[SEP]i would highy recommend this hotel for couples going to paris.
1	this hotel was fantastic.[SEP]the room was clean and very cute ; we even had a little table outside.[SEP]although it is a little far from the center of paris the metro is right there and there are several nice places to eat in the general area.[SEP]i loved the suggestions put together by the hotel, we had a great meal at a bistro right around the corner.[SEP]we paid a little extra for a larger bed and it was worth the money... very comfortable with nice bedding.[SEP]i have stayed in some pretty crappy hotels in paris for more money, the porte d'oree was by far the nicest i've stayed for the price range.[SEP]as other reviewers have suggested, don't miss the boulangerie next door!
5 11	i stayed at this property on the 4th march for a 2 night duration.[SEP]on arrival the staff greeted us with great service and dealt with our party of 11 in no time.[SEP]i was amazed with the decor of the hotel.[SEP]its styled in the theme of a wall street banking and stock exchange this (as you can see from the pictures!) in the room was twin beds, flat screen tv, and a free safe.[SEP]bathroom consisted of a free standing sink and shower etc.[SEP]beds were changed everyday.[SEP]i went into my friends rooms and they were of the same standard.[SEP]the bar area has the widest range of spirits i have ever seen in my life![SEP]obviously the hotel was nt the cheapest place to have a drink but it was really nice before heading out.[SEP]a pint of beer was 5 euro in the hotel.[SEP]the hotel was situated near and underground station which was a only about 200 yards away.[SEP]overall i would recommend this hotel to any of my clients wishing to stay in berlin.
1	i stayed here in 2007 with my friend in the moroccan room.[SEP]i ca nt recall it being unclean like some have said previously.[SEP]infact, all i remember are the wonderful staff who would do anything for you.[SEP]the vertical stairs, which were amazing lol and the lovely times we had sat in the bar, being allowed to choose our own music off the computer, and when they played dub side of the moon,(which i had never heard before then) they gave me a copy on disc to take home free of charge.[SEP]wonderful service, superb atmosphere.[SEP]real people.[SEP]you ca nt go wrong.
1	stayed at the fairmont queen elizabeth april 20 - 26 and then again from may 4 - 6.[SEP]the rooms are small, but are very clean.[SEP]the staff are excellent to deal with.[SEP]they are polite and helpfull at all times.[SEP]rue st.[SEP]catherine is only a few blocks away.[SEP]you can walk to crescent street and it's a short metro ride to old montreal and rue st deni.[SEP]i would reccommend this hotel to anyone.[SEP]make sure you ask about a corporate rate.[SEP]we stayed for $131.00 (canadian).
3	i booked the hotel on priceline.[SEP]the claremont charged me another $4 per day as a " resort fee.[SEP]" that means that i paid priceline and then i had to pay more money when i checked into the hotel.[SEP]the room was filthy.[SEP]i had to mop the floor with a wet towel in order to walk on it, without having my feet covered in dirt.[SEP]there was no maid service at all.[SEP]i spent two nights and no maid ever set foot in my room.[SEP]when i went to plug in the clock radio, sparks shot out of the outlet.[SEP]i told the manager, she went into another room supposedly to discuss my complaints, told me to come back in a half hour and nothing was done.[SEP]i gave her my contact info.[SEP](cell number, name, etc.) and nobody has called me yet and that was three days ago.[SEP]the only good thing about the hotel is that it is close to disney world.[SEP]one more thing.[SEP]when i checked in at midnight, there was one clerk and ten people in front of me.[SEP]it took around a half an hour to check in.
8 11	it is a mediocre hotel and the closet stunk.[SEP]my room was one of the top floors, elevators take time to reach there, the restaurant service is slow, and there is no nearby restaurant / shopping area -- this is in middle of nowhere despite being minutes from lax.[SEP]most folks in the shuttle (common shared shuttle from airport) were going to westin but i am sure it must be pricier -- i was the only person getting off at la quinta and i felt miserable when i entered my room.[SEP]btw, there were all sorts of dogs/ k-9 lovers in the elevator.[SEP]i wish i had known this before.[SEP]the original room that they gave me at 7:00 p.m. on the day of check - in was not ready.[SEP]i went to my room to be greeted by housekeeping who were cleaning a bad mess.[SEP]one of them took the slow elevator back to lobby and got me my keys to a different room.[SEP]- the room that i got into was very far from elevators and very musty.[SEP]- the bed was ok but comforters were not thick / plush for a good cozy sleep.[SEP]- had to keep the fans on to kill the musty smell but the fans were noisy and too close to the bed.[SEP]- some dust / allergens and i kept coughing through out the night.[SEP]- only nearby restaurant belongs to hotel --extremely slow service and food is not consistent.
2	we stayed in the 1bedroom suite over easter break while we visited the disney theme parks.[SEP]the hotel was above and beyond what we expected!![SEP]very clean with such an amazing and friendly staff!![SEP]my youngest daughter, 5, had a small break down that she had to leave her baby doll in the room while we were at the parks, when we came back our housekeeper had cleaned the room and placed " henry " in the made bed like he was napping, my daughter was so excited to see that henry had been taken care of while she was gone!!![SEP]we are florida residents and visit the parks several times a year and we will always stay at the hawthorn suites!!!
1 12	my husband and i went here for our anniversary last week -- our third trip to vegas in 5 years.[SEP]we chose this hotel because of its size, variety or restaurants, and pool area.[SEP]the good: staff was very friendly and helpful.[SEP]our room was anice -- great view, and a spacious bathroom and tub.[SEP]we loved the lazy river and wave pool, it was a great way to spend the afternoon since it wasn't too hot.[SEP]we had some great meals at the border grill, spago, and burger bar.[SEP]the buffet was ok -- but very efficient, with short to non - existent lines.[SEP]the very bad: this was the smokiest casino hotel we've been to.[SEP]yes, there is smoking in all casinos and that won't change, but mandalay bay seemed the worst.[SEP]a) no smoke - free tables like many casinos do, b) davidoff cigars and cigarettes were aggressively sold around the room, and c) the ventilation seemed very poor -- smoke permeated everywhere -- into the restaurants, the lobby -- even the hallways of the non - smoking rooms![SEP]we stunk at the end of the night we played in its casino.[SEP]not so after others (including bellagio, hard rock, cesars, and mgm).[SEP]also, the pool's " beach " was a little like a giant ashtray -- it felt cleaner to sit in the pool area.[SEP]our vacation was still great, but i would probably not stay at this casino hotel again.
7 9	we decided to choose hotel because it looks good and comfortable.[SEP]not too far away from rome centre.[SEP]there was also bus stop nearby which goes to the nearest metro station.[SEP]upon arrival the front desk was very nice and helpful even it was late night.[SEP]when we were leaving there was a computer with printer so we were able to do a online check - in very easily![SEP]and we get a very good map from front desk too.[SEP]hotel room was pretty small because from pictures it looks more larger.[SEP]it was also little dissapointment cause there was some little dirt in sheets.[SEP]well, it was so small dirt that we didn´t want to change it.[SEP]another mind sharp thing was that cleaners did not change sheets every day (oh yes, we had that tag in the door).[SEP]they just only turn sheets round that s all.[SEP]couple of days after they luckily change sheets completely.[SEP]i really not sure, but i think there was then some other cleaner... however, room was fine cause we didn´t spend much time there.[SEP]very nice thing that there was a free breakfast including.[SEP]breakfast was good and so on good value for money.[SEP]there was yogurt, good rolls, croissants, some cakes and of course coffee.[SEP]so, breakfast was very nice except one morning there was a little bit exceptional thing.[SEP]when we were taking some croissant there was ants under of croissants?![SEP]so we didn´t eat croissants anymore...
23	it is a limited service hotel.[SEP]no room service (food).[SEP]no bar in the fridge.[SEP]but just about everything else.[SEP]writing desk, tv, radio, hairdryer, laundry service, ironing room, breakfast included in room price, 3/4 restaurants / bars in the hotel building.[SEP]you are not going to pay a ridiculous sum of money for a marble entrance with a waterfall or two large ballrooms at this hotel.[SEP]although it is not pricey, in a way it is trendy classy.[SEP]the staff all wear a smart casual uniform in green and white.[SEP]they look cool.[SEP]the wait staff all wear those thick lensed eyeglasses and have animie haircuts.[SEP]and what's more they are efficient.[SEP]the rooms have been featured in style magazines.[SEP]why?[SEP]because they are fresh.[SEP]nice colours, crisp linen bed covers, tasteful artworks, expensive tap fittings and so on.[SEP]each room has a very interesting bathroom door feature.[SEP]whilst the rooms are not speacious - you do get a king sized bed with at least a metre gap to the sofa bed.[SEP]there is space in and around the desk.[SEP]you get one wardrobe, some shelving, a fridge and a luggage rack.[SEP]an ironing room is available on another floor if you want to freshen up your clothes and the hotel does offer a quick laundry service.[SEP]there are 3 breakfast choices - western, asian or vegetarian.[SEP]location is superb - directly opposite the times square shopping complex.[SEP]mtr is in the times square.[SEP]definitley would recommend to anyone loking for a decent place to stay.
2	nice location, an easy walk clarke quay along the river, or catch the # 51 bus to chinatown mrt.[SEP]service is excellent along with a nice lobby.[SEP]alas the rooms are well overdue a revamp.[SEP]the 6 of us (3 couples) were given a king room, a queen room and a double room, but at least they were on the same floor.[SEP]the world's slowest elevators are also part of the package.[SEP]we spent a week here and survived so it can't be all that bad.[SEP]adequate.[SEP]could be a really excellent hotel with a bit of work, but there are nicer hotels for the same price around.
8 9	check in 02/28/2011, 14 nights the hotel is located near the main train station, a 10 - 15 walk.[SEP]the metro line is close as well.[SEP]the young women, daughter - in - law of the owner, was the bright spot in the service.[SEP]these are the pluses.[SEP]the place was not very well run.[SEP]we there in the winter, the heat was not always on, as the owner of the building turns it off during the night.[SEP]the breakfasts, served in the room were a quality lower than airplane food.[SEP]the air quality is not good in rome, even worse in the hotel.[SEP]they were constantly spraying air freshner to hide whatever was being smoked by the staff and family.[SEP]this is not a place we would go back to.[SEP]it was a bargain, but sometimes you get what you pay for, or less.[SEP]this was one of those times.
1 2 4	this hotel does not meet the standards of a four star hotel.[SEP]the room was in a terrible state of disrepair, with badly worn floors, a permanently stained chair frayed at the edges, a tv stand with knife gouges, a broken shower fixture and a broken sliding door on a closet the width of a cereal box.[SEP]the window was covered with accumulated dirt from the outside, and dirt and hair were evident behind the door and in the corners of the bathroom floor.[SEP]there was also a half used bottle of body wash.[SEP]in the hallways and in front of the elevator, the carpets were stained and obviously dirty.[SEP]in addition, the ceiling in the hotel lobby is seriously water damaged.[SEP]moreover, access to the beach is over the freeway and through a large dirty parking lot.[SEP]the staff at the hotel admitted that the hotel was not in good condition and said there are better three star hotels.[SEP]he suggested that a four star hotel does not suggest a quality or luxury hotel, but only the size of the room as defined by the government of spain.[SEP]staying at this hotel was a very disappointing experience.
0 0	fab hotel great location we stayed here for two nights for our 20th wedding anniversary and i have to say this is a fantastic hotel in a great location, when we looked out of our window we had a birds eye view of tower bridge.the staff could nt have been nicer from the minute we checked in which i have to say was the smoothest check in ever, nothing is a problem.we had the breakfast on the two mornings and i would highly recommend this as you got a great feed and we did nt have to eat all day!!the rooms are a great size we had two televisions and two dvd players!!plenty of tea and coffe, biscuits and complimentary bottled water every day, the bed was sooo comfy.it was also so quiet at night but at the same time everything was so near, the tower hill tube station is just around the corner and the tower of london beside you and there are lovely walks along the river.we will definately stay in this hotel again and have recommended it to some of our friends who are going to london
4	picked the mirage because of the location and the pool.[SEP]both of which lived up to my expectations.[SEP]however, this stay was full of bumps in the road.[SEP]checked into my room around 11 pm.[SEP]it hadn't been cleaned from the previous guests.[SEP]the front desk promptly sent up a cleaning crew and comped the room for the night.[SEP]day three the room wasn't cleaned again so we got a credit towards food and beverage.[SEP]i will say service on the " repairs " was quick.[SEP]the room itself was rather odd.[SEP]strange shapes and colors.[SEP]the bathroom mirror was surrounded by bright lights that gave off an eerie feel.[SEP]defenitly won't go back!
9 10	my husband and i traveled to san francisco labor day weekend.[SEP]we had a blast![SEP]the hotel diva was wonderful.[SEP]first, we had to reschedule our trip and the hotel was very accomadating.[SEP]when we arrived, we were greated by two great guys at the front desk.[SEP]then when we went to the room we had a glass of wine waiting for us.[SEP]we stayed on the suite floor, so we had continental breakfast every morning, our room was large, and we didn't have a problem with noise.[SEP]our bathroom was a bit small, but not to bad.[SEP]i would reccommend going to the alcatraz night tour through alcatraz cruises.[SEP]it was amazing![SEP]we really enjoyed our time and hotel diva was the icing on the cake!
0 2 4 5	outdated, needs renovation we have spent 3 nights at the gromada hotel am tegeler see in june 2008 and have been disappointed.[SEP]the building dates from the 70ties, an so does the interior.[SEP]everything appears worn and old.[SEP]beds are the worst.[SEP]rooms are untidy and seem dirty.[SEP](ants in the shower is not what you'd like to find there.)breakfast is mediocre, prepared with little care.[SEP]but at least there is some variety to choose from.[SEP]the location is far from the city centre, although the subway station is just a 10 minute walk away.[SEP]subways run until 0:30 on weekdays, so no problem with that.[SEP]we certainly would not stay a second time here.
2	unlike most hotels in the st regis chain, this is extremely good.[SEP]the service is supreme.[SEP]the rooms are clean, spacious, great views.the beds comfortable.[SEP]there is however one let down: the resturant for breakfast is nothing less than a disaster and highly priced, with almost humorous service, in fact you could re make faulty towers here.[SEP]the biggest plus for this hotel are the concierges, normally in my experience snobby, uncreative at best ; here at the st regis truly great, helpfull and best of all knowlegable.[SEP]the st regis is probably the best hotel in san francisco
0	the apartment was clean and spacious, it was well equipped with micrwave oven, cooktop, fridge, separate dining and living room as well as a large bathroom and spacious bedroom.[SEP]i liked the fact that i didn, t have to get up and attend a set time breakfast, and was able to iron clothes in the apartment.[SEP]the position is great with a monorail stop in the building and light rail only a 3 minute walk away.[SEP]directly across the road from dixon street, the chinatown, i was able to buy food or eat out any time.[SEP]my room faced a central atrium and while i didn, t have a view, i was grateful for the quiet this offered as i believe the outside rooms receive a lot of traffic noise.
8 10	our reservation was handled professionally followed by appropriate confirmation.[SEP]the reception (doormen, front desk and concierge) was pleasant and professional.[SEP]we arrived early, on the day following a long weekend, nevertheless our room was ready.[SEP]the hotel is extremely well located, in the centre, and conveniently close to most activities.[SEP]in general, the hotel seems to be run efficiently, our room (king suite) was well laid out although the bathroom was much smaller than we would have expected.[SEP]we prefer this style of classical, older boutique hotel but if our room was representative the mayflower park is in urgent need of renovation.[SEP]we had lunch in the hotel ’s oliver ’s.[SEP]the food was adequate.[SEP]the sole waitress was pleasant but her appearance would be improved if she were to remove the obvious chewing gum from her mouth lacking.[SEP]the waiter who delivered our meals acted as though he would have preferred to be anywhere else but working, especially serving customers.[SEP]with such a large range of hotels in seattle we would probably not return to mayflower park
5	i was very impressed with the hotel's website.[SEP]it's too bad they have not put as much effort into maintaining their hotel as they have their webpage.[SEP]the staff are friendly and responded quickly to questions i had via email.[SEP]i appreciated the fact that the hotel had free wireless because i was traveling with my laptop but after that the amenities go quickly down hill.[SEP]the bed sagged terribly and had i needed to spend more than one night in it my back would have suffered greatly![SEP]the room was not clean, the tv did not work, the toilet did not work, and the ceiling leaked when the guests above took their shower.[SEP]when these issues were mentioned to the hotel owner, he seemed nonplussed but said he would look into it.[SEP]although cheap, i would have to agree with another reviewer in saying that this hotel is not worth the money you save.
3	we stayed at the newton for four nights while settling our daughter into columbia university.[SEP]it is only three subway stops from there and actually walking distance (mile and a half).[SEP]our room overlooked broadway but not too much traffic at night so noise not a problem.[SEP]everything very clean, en suite bathroom modern and clean.[SEP]prompt and thorough maid service.[SEP]the desk staff very friendly and helpful with maps, advice, directions etc.[SEP]quick subway ride to times square etc and sightseeing bus stops right outside.[SEP]this is a great budget (although not so budget at the end of august) hotel with no frills.[SEP]no complaints at all.[SEP]what made our stay was the excellent key west diner next door which serves a good and very reasonable breakfast with great service.[SEP]they offer room service to the hotel too although we didn't try that.[SEP]other interesting restaurants to be found close by on amsterdam.
1 1 3	checked in on 17th september for a 5 night stay in a bay front suite, check in was ok.[SEP]arrived at the suite which was way below expectations: on entering the lounge / seating area looked like something from a down - market car rental reception and was dark smelly and scruffy, the sliding door to the bathrom was jammed half open and the " balcony " was so small there was no room to stand because the two tiny wooden chairs were using all the space and you could not sit on them as there was no space between them to put your legs![SEP]we phoned reception and after about an hour a maintenance man arrived who fixed the bathroom door so it could be opened and closed.[SEP]the bathroom itself was tatty, dirty and had seen better days, as had the whole suite.[SEP]we were extremely unhappy and went to reception and told the manager we would only be staying one night instead of the five we had booked.[SEP]it used to be that hyatt was an up - scale brand, you paid a premium and received a premium product.[SEP]the hyatt mission bay resort is trying successfully to destroy hyatt's brand and reputation - do not stay there.[SEP]our previous bad experience at the hyatt santa barbara combined with this disaster at mission bay means that after years of being a hyatt gold passport elite member i have transferred my points elsewhere and will not risk staying at hyatt in the future - very sad.
0	the condition of the room was terrible.[SEP]we've stayed the hotel one night and it was enough for saying a lot of not polite words for condition of this hotel.
2	this stay was a nightmare![SEP]our 1st night we had trouble with the tv and then moved because there was no one to service it![SEP]the only room (we were told) that was available for us was the room across from the laundry, workout room and elevators and had a stale smell but after a 14 hour drive were to tired to move again.[SEP]in the morning we noticed the mattress pad was torn to shredds and upon leaving for the day we requested this be replaced!![SEP]also, we have no reading lamp on one side of the bed.[SEP]on the other side the reading lamp had no working switch and there was no clock in our room.[SEP]i requested their attention to these problems at the front desk as we left early that morning.[SEP]we needed to be in town for medical reasons and every night we had to deal with problems not address by staff that over and over again did not care!!![SEP]finally after the 3rd day we decided to leave the next morning -- i requested to have the manager come up to our room because the phone calls & front desk had not addressed our concerns!![SEP]finally, he did see what we had problems with and was very apologetic saying he couldn't understand how our room past inspection and had our lamp replaced and helped change our bed linens.[SEP]to little to late - after some very stressful days we needed peace and calm not more problems with our hotel room![SEP]we will never stay here again!
1 7	i would think in good ole usa with our code enforced policies and health agencies that a hotel as bad as this one would be condemed.[SEP]i can not even imagine the bacteria, viruses and disease floating around this flea bag hotel.[SEP]i would suggest to everyone contemplating a visit to new york to either save a little more money or use the all american plastic and stay at a higher priced hotel because in this instance " money really does buy happiness ".[SEP]this is by far the worst hotel i ever seen or stayed in within the usa borders.[SEP]i now know why you are expected to pay for your room at the time of making the reservation because there are very few people that would stay after viewing the lobby let alone the rooms if not pre paid.[SEP]i am disappointed in new york for allowing such a hotel to tarnish its patriotic state.[SEP]shut it down before you find someone dead and stuffed in a matress!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!![SEP]it has only been three days since my stay i am still leary that i may have some horrible disease, virus or bacteria just lurking, waiting to rear its ugly head.
0	if you want the best location and a very knowledgable, courteous staff with nice rooms and baths, this must be your choice!
2 4	where do i start!?[SEP]the breakfast is a canteen where you have to elbow your way to food and tables.[SEP]there are individual condoms taken from strips in the vending machines.[SEP]the rooms have barely any light.[SEP]the place is manky.[SEP]don't do it.
1 6	this dump should be condemned.[SEP]everything is filthy and falling apart.[SEP]the front steps are crumbling and the carpet and furniture are held together with duct tape.[SEP]the sagging, rotten beds are full of holes.[SEP]our window was broken and held together with masking tape.[SEP]the tv didn't work and we were promised a replacement which never came.[SEP]the bathroom reeked of urine.[SEP]i was led to believe that breakfast was included, but after having a glass of juice, cup of crappy coffee and a dried - up croissant i was given a bill for eight pounds![SEP]the staff was rude, belligerent, discourteous and barely spoke english.[SEP]the building hasn't seen a paintbrush in years.[SEP]this once grand structure deserves far better than the money -- that currently own and operate what is laughingly called a hotel.
1	checked in to hotel after a hectic day of travelling (airline delays, weather, etc.), just in time to drop off luggage and grab a cab for theater.[SEP]told the front desk manager upon departing for theater that the room was dirty, the floor was sagging, the water in the bathroom was dripping, and we wanted a new room.[SEP]upon our return from the theater, we were told that our luggage was moved to a new room in " thetower ", to a newly (2006) renovated room.[SEP]the only difference was that it was on a higher floor.[SEP]after midnight, in freezing weather, we gathered our luggage and left the hotel, and checked in to the lovely helmsley park lane for an increased price of $300 over a 3 day stay.[SEP]you obviously get what you pay for!!!
4	small, but beautifully formed.[SEP]tucked away just off the grand canal, you could easily miss it, it's so discrete![SEP]our advice is to use a water taxi to come in - apart from the fact that it's a great ride, it drops you within about 30 yards of the door, and i'm not sure we would have found it in the dark from the nearest alilaguna stop, staff are all brilliant, pleasant and so very helpful.[SEP]our sincere thanks to them all.[SEP]our room was a delight, comfy bed and a slick bathroom.[SEP]this trip was a retirement present from my company.[SEP]we will both remember it with huge pleasure and hope to be able to return in the future.
2 3 4	arrived late with little time, meeting partner for meal the other side of london which was already pre - booked or would have found another hotel.[SEP]the new wallpaper was nice but that was it.[SEP]the toliet did nt flush properly, the door on the bathroom was dirty as were the sheets.[SEP]the furniture was old.[SEP]the lift carpet was disgusting.[SEP]the air - con was nt cool... and if you think you are getting a breakfast, think again.[SEP]fruit bowl consisted of 1 chopped strawberry with 2 tiny cubes of melon.[SEP]they are charging (sorry, ripping off) olympic customers by charging £ 675 per night for a single room, this giving the uk a bad name.[SEP]extremely unfair if they get away with this.
1	this was my first trip to barcelona and i truly enjoyed my stay.[SEP]modern design, classy and chic!
0 0	disapointing with the standard of the rooms - parking is very expensive, room was very small, linen was not as clean as it should be - no face cloths, not what i expected from a hotel of this reputation.
6 9	just got back from a 4-day stay at the desert ridge.[SEP]really gorgeous place with great service.[SEP]was there for a conference and all of the conference sessions were fantastic.[SEP]the hotel was cool and never too warm (no easy feat in phoenix in august!) and refreshments were always stocked.[SEP]food at the banquet meals was fantastic, and i usually hate banquet meals.[SEP]food service staff was great.[SEP]hotel was very clean and fantastic service throughout.[SEP]gorgeous pool area with several pools and very ample chairs / shade available.[SEP]really nice patio / lanai area.[SEP]rooms were nice and very clean.[SEP]this is a resort experience.[SEP]my only gripes: housekeeping staff never quite caught on that there were 4 of us in the room and never left enough towels / washcloths so we had to keep asking for them.[SEP]prices at bar were very high.[SEP]bad wireless connections and had to pay to have it in room, but free in lobby.[SEP]not much to complain about, but had i been paying for this myself (and it is pricey), i probably would not have been more annoyed about these minor things.[SEP]room has everything: alarm clock, tv, toiletries.[SEP]very large shopping area with great stores / restaurants across the street (about a 10 - 15 minute walk i would guess).[SEP]very nice place with great service.[SEP]i would go back.
5	..[SEP]rather one of the worst, pairing with ic miramar in panama city.[SEP]there are good things in the hotel, the bellboys, the breakfast, and a very nice housekeeper that did her best.[SEP]but the rest ; - laundry, quick but way to much starching of shirt, delivered on a hanger even if asked for doubled.[SEP]- room, first one given did had a nonfunctional safe (which maintenance knew of when calling- evenso the room was offered to a customer the hotel knew is an ambassadeur gold member, staying a lot in ichotels).[SEP]second room had a functional safe, but furniture in so dirty shape, a not fully filled minibar, and no extra fringes for ambassadeur gold members - no upgrade of room was provided- even if that is standard for gold members - the bill on check out was generous, no laundry added, one breakfast missing - of course this is positive on one side, but on another it shows a hotel that has a malfunctioning billing system.[SEP]but i did sleep very well in a very comfortable bed.....[SEP]but will not return to this hotel again.
2	the rooms are so small you hit your knees off the bathroom wall when sitting on the toilet, staff were really unhelpful although they often smiled whilst being unhelpful.[SEP]i had a business meeting booked for 11.00am in the lounge and was told i would have to wait until 12 to order coffee, after running around the hotel i did get coffee served in paper cups and charged almost 30 bucks them, the waitres refused to carry them to the lounge so spent another 10 mins hanging around the kitchen door.[SEP]my room had cobwebs in corners and wasn't cleaned properly in bathroom.[SEP]no information is provided in the rooms (basic stuff really) so called down to ask where the sky bar was and was told the 13th floor.... there is no 13th floor..[SEP]i stayed here almost 10 years ago and had a great stay but this place has truly lost its shine, i would never come back here again much better hotels out there for less money and with much better service
6 0	great value  we stayed at the belvedere hotel sept.[SEP]21 - 28, 2008.[SEP]we were in new york mainly to see some broadway musicals.[SEP]this hotel is idealy located.[SEP]we saw 5 musicals and the furthest walk we had was 10 minutes.[SEP]it's also about a 10 minute walk to times square.[SEP]the room we had (523) was very large by new york standards, super clean and in newly renovated condition.[SEP]the room had a comfortable king size bed, desk and sitting chair as well as a microwave and bar fridge.[SEP]our costs were about $299/night but included a full breakfast.[SEP]the hotel staff were friendly and helpful.[SEP]our only complaint was that the elevators were very slow and we walked down rather than take the elevators.
2 2	cheap but not worth it the hotel was cheap.[SEP]the bed and bathroom were clean and the floor clean.[SEP]however, the decoration of the hotel was poor (it looked like it was prepared for painting months ago, but no work done on it), and other parts of the room (ledges, window etc) were covered in dust.[SEP]i would not stay there again.[SEP]i would find somewhere else and pay more if necessary.
