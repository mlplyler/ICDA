0	this is a great hotel for a single person in new york where hotel prices can be very expensive.[SEP]however, i think it would be a bit cramped for a couple.[SEP]the shower and wash basin are in the room and the wc is located down the corridor.[SEP]the hotel is clean and has both ac and a fan and is furnished with arts and craft furniture.[SEP]location is quiet but you need to take the subway to get to the action in new york, however it is an easy walk to greenwich village.[SEP]i found a great restaurant close by called cookshop on 20th street on the corner of 9th avenue.[SEP]great price for a single person in a quiet area
0	we stayed at this hotel for 2 nights as part of a " build your own " vacation from gate 1.[SEP]the hotel was " as expected ".[SEP]not in the city center, but not far from the metro station " manzoni ".[SEP]it was very easy to get there from termini, we just had a hard time finding the hotel on th street.[SEP]the location itself is not bad.[SEP]its about a 1mi walk to the colusseum.[SEP]there is a grocery store closeby, as well as a good resturant recommended by the staff called " the crazy sheep ".[SEP]its calabrese food and very, very good![SEP]the staff was very friendly although we did not have much interaction with them.[SEP]the complementary breakfast is kind of bleh... coffee and a roll, typical italian braskfast, just not what were used to![SEP]the rooms are very small but there was a huge closet.[SEP]the beds were very hard, but not the worst i ve slept on in europe.[SEP]we had a small terrace right off our room which was nice but we did nt really use it.[SEP]when you re sitting down you ca nt see the street anyway.[SEP]i saw a few other posts mentioned road noise - we had no problem with this whatsoever.[SEP]if you re on a budget this hotel is fine!
0	very pretty place, but did not like the front desk (" you can join us for breakfast in the citron for $24 dollars "), yes, she said that with a straight face.[SEP]and she was much more interested in getting me to upgrade from $269/night (a discounted conference rate) to a discounted additional $100/night (normally an additional $200/night) for a suite.[SEP]internet is an additional $15.95/day... for something that costs them very little![SEP]they really take advantage of guests in this isolated location.[SEP]i'm a very dedicated marriott customer, but this place is over the top.[SEP]rooms are sort of small, nice pool.
0	clearly this is not a bad hotel.[SEP]but it's clearly not the best hyatt i have stayed at.[SEP]talking san francisco, the embarcadero hyatt is clearly a better hotel.[SEP]as to location, fisherman's wharf is just a huge tourist trap, and a pretty bad one at that.[SEP]ok, one might want to give a look at alcatraz, maybe, if there weren't so many tourists, walk along the coat.[SEP]so, a short stop in the area might be ok, but why staying overnight in that area?[SEP](only reason we ended up there was the conference that i attended and which i would have wished to go elsewhere).[SEP]anyway, in my book, location is a minus, not a plus.[SEP]rooms are ok, beds are nice.[SEP]hallways are long.[SEP]our shower, a disabled - accessible walk in shower, would have been nice if the flow rate would have been a bit higher and we could have moved it higher up.[SEP]our windows opened up on the courtyard, probably because we booked the cheapest rate, so i can not really complain about that.[SEP]however, on the second floor, it really felt like a basement suite.[SEP]restaurant is not a real restaurant and wine selection is very limited.[SEP]first two selections that we ordered from the list turned out not to be available so we ended up with our third choice which was not great.
0	we stopped here for two nights on the fantastic price of â£19 per night, and because of the price we really couldn't complain![SEP]however, on checking in we were told that their lifts were not working, after asking, we found out they had been broken for over a week![SEP]we were then told we were on the 4th floor, and with three suitcases (one per room), no porters, we struggled to drag / haul these to our rooms.[SEP]not a good start.[SEP]however the rooms themselves were clean and the decor was ok.[SEP]we too had a cracked mirror, which we assumed may have come from the kettle which was next too it.[SEP]two of the rooms were at the front of the hotel and the road noise was pretty bad, especially as the windows didn't close completely.[SEP]the room at the back of the hotel was much better, until the bin men arrived at 8 am![SEP]this room also had minimal hot water though and no plug.[SEP]the location was half way between farringdon tube and kings cross tube, so in future i will first look at cheap rooms at kings cross royal scot (stayed here before and much nicer).[SEP]it definitely was a good 10 minute walk to this hotel, but if it comes down to price and availability i would stay here for â£19 per night![SEP]there is also a j d wetherspoons down the road (5 - 10 minute walk) for â£2.49 breakfasts!
0	stayed here on a last minute emergency for 1 night, i payed very little so i m not someone who pays a 3 star price and then complains that its not a 5 star.[SEP]location is a little of the beaten tourist track, but i have to say if it was more central i'm guessing the rates would be quite a bit higher.[SEP]its right in front in front of a tram stop which is a plus.[SEP]really well deigned' design' hotel, decorated to a high level, very tasteful and modern breakfast was really good continental breakfast.[SEP]staff were very friendly, making conversation and very helpful.[SEP]rooms, as i said i payed very little so i got what i payed for which is fine, single room in the basement, it was teeny tiny, but in a cute way and still well designed.[SEP]if i was staying longer or paid more i think it would have become an issue.
0	the hotel has great services, is very comfortable and neat.[SEP]the sauna and gym are free, as well as the room internet.[SEP]the rooms are great too, and so is the breakfast.[SEP]my room had a great view also, and was very silent.[SEP]the only problem for this hotel is itâ´s location.[SEP]itâ´s good for being near the airport, but at the same time itâ´s far away from the touristic sites and the city center.[SEP]but at least the hotel offers a free shuttle to sulthanamed (where the grand bazar, the blue mosque and hagia sophia are) and the taksim area (good comercial center).
0	not that hip for a w hotel.[SEP]rooms just ok, with views of a highway under construction.[SEP]alot of construction in this area, and nothing special except you are smack across the street from aa center.[SEP]ghost bar on the roof was very tame for a thursday night, and one would have expected that since the mav's game across the street had just finished there would be some activity here, not.[SEP]have stayed at crescent court, mansion on turtle creek and hotel zaza.[SEP]crescent court the best out of them all based on hotel experience, location and food choices... will try ritz next time around, but so far crescent court the best hotel in dallas in my opinion.
0	once again, we were seduced by the website photos and didn't look too hard at the location.[SEP]it's 20 minutes from downtown on the metro, then 10 minutes walk to the station through an industrial area (building sites, warehouses, vacant lots).[SEP]no cafes or shops nearby.[SEP]hotel interior lovely with a very modern design and great rooms.[SEP]charges for wifi/ broadband are 15 euro per day - a con when other places in spain provide it free... service at the hotel bar was a little erratic
0	the holiday inn on the bay had everything we needed for our three night stay in san diego... it was clean, secure, convenient and had the added convenience of free wifi internet.[SEP]the only negatives that come to mind are that the property doesn't in my experience deserve three stars.... two and a half stars would be generous![SEP]the $18 parking is insanely expensive, and the location... unless you are boarding a cruise ship... is not too convenient.[SEP]the walk to the gaslamp quarter is a good six blocks walk through an endless expanse of train tracks and parking lots.[SEP]however, the staff were polite and efficient without exception, and i might consider this property again at priceline rates.
0	location is the problem here.[SEP]didn't feel safe to walk outside but the front desk got cabs with ease.[SEP]very noisy outside, double glazing would help.[SEP]room excellent, staff excellent, facilities excellent, restaurant / bar excellent, reasonably priced, shuttle to airport excellent.[SEP]if it were somewhere else it would get a 5!
0	apartment is 5 min walk from main hotel, in the middle of a local area.[SEP]local vegetable and other shops right next to entrance, lots of cats.[SEP]no lift.[SEP]plus: 10 min walk from blue mosque, good size, kitchen, helpful staff negative: location, overall standard quite poor, breakfast on the whole we enjoyed our stay, but were not expecting the apt to be in the location it was.[SEP]would not return
0	we stayed here because they had a special deal.[SEP]and it just wasn't worth the few bucks we saved.[SEP]the room was in an area that hasn't been upgraded yet so stuff in the rooms didn't work as well as it should.[SEP]and the casino itself is one of the worst.[SEP]tons of kids around, boring food choices.[SEP]we went to one place for lunch and the folks next to us were so drunk it was uncomfortable.[SEP]the pools were small and off to the side, really an afterthought.[SEP]it's about the best place around if you are really on a budget.[SEP]and they do have free wifi.[SEP]but the location of the place is not ideal and the overall quality is weak.
0	the pembridge hotel is the worst value for money hotel i have ever stayed in.[SEP]the location is great but that is the only good thing about it.[SEP]the rooms are awful, and literally the size of the bed and very old fashioned and not decorated.[SEP]our room was in the basement next to the laundry room, it was one of the worst nights sleep i have ever had in a hotel.[SEP]on top of this in the morning the breakfast room was far too small for the amount of visitors.[SEP]people were standing up eating breakfast and microwaving their coffee as it was cold.[SEP]for â£100 it was a total rip off.
0	i have stayed in this hotels with my friends in october 2008 for 10 days (b&b fare).....[SEP]it was really a very nice hotel..[SEP]very friendly cooperative staff with a delicious breakfast.....[SEP]the room was big and renovated with wifi access, also they have 6 computers in the lobby free of charge for the internet public use.[SEP]the only problem was the location: prepare yourself to pay taxi 20 $$every time you want to go to the old city.... or just wait a little and take the free shuttle (i think its only 4 times a day).....[SEP]the swimming pool was small and the sauna was a small cabinet but clean..[SEP]however the turkish bath was some how smelly..!!![SEP]i did not use it.....[SEP]apart from its location, i think its really very nice hotel with small swimming pool and excellent services... and definitely deserve to be in the top 25 hotels in istanbul for its standards....
0	check your buttons![SEP]nice big rooms, great bar (free each evening for a couple of hours), attentive service.[SEP]for me, this is not a great location, as there is nothing in walking distance.[SEP]however, be careful with your laundry.[SEP]i handed a blazer in for dry cleaning and was wearing it to a meeting when i was asked where the buttons were.[SEP]good question, as there should have been 12 of them and they were all missing.[SEP]the laundry had taken all of them off and not replaced them.[SEP]when i got back they quickly put them back on - badly - and they're all coming off again!![SEP]bizarre.
0	fair, but not convenient i read all the raving reviews about ellie's and booked my weekend there.[SEP]while the hotel itself is nice enough - clean rooms, pretty grounds, i felt a little mislead about the location.[SEP]in actuality, it is located in the middle of a residential area, crammed in between 2 homes.[SEP]there is no mountain / hill view that i could tell, and the water view is of the pool.[SEP]you can see the water from the top level balcony, but it looks to be about a mile away.[SEP]i had envisioned something set back from the beach, kind of secluded.[SEP]and i never met that van guy several people referred to.....[SEP]the front desk was helpful organizing a day driver for me, and that is what i could recommend.[SEP]with the random location of the hotel, i was concerned a regular taxi would not know how to find the place.[SEP]location is not near kuta, which is more touristy and fun.[SEP]i am sorry i didn't stay in kuta -- you can walk to restaurants, shops and beaches from hotels in kuta.
0	one would generally not go to new york city for a hotel experience and especially not the hotel carter.[SEP]the location is fantastic, and the area is safe, but aren't you lucky that you are only staying for a few hours per night![SEP]the shower water was hot, the toilet flushed ok and it had beds, just.[SEP]included with the beds were welcome visitors... bugs and they welcome new visitors with relish, yum yum yum and leave one with their calling cards.[SEP]the 1970's style tv had sort of a picture on a couple of channels and there was an air conditioner of some sort.[SEP]the reception was ok.[SEP]if you could find another hotel as convenient, do so
0	marriott has a lot of brass calling this an airport location.[SEP]to be more direct, it is downright misleading and not true, especially considering the fact that downtown montreal is as distant from the airport as this property..[SEP]arriving at 9pm and departing at 6am, it took between 20 - 25 minutes, door to door.[SEP]this was with no traffic whatsoever.[SEP]the rooms are what you'd expect for the dollar.[SEP]we got sort of a kick out of the restaurant's pretensions.[SEP]white linen tablecloths, waiters in bistro aprons, and portion control butter, ketchup, etc.[SEP]the room is no more than moderately attractive, the service inadequate and the prices are much too high for the calibre of the food that is served.[SEP]the property is located in a virtual wasteland, that is especially unattractive ; seemingly in an enormous corporate / light industrial park.[SEP]there is no public commerce [ reatil restaurants, convenience stores, etc.[SEP]] anywhere within walking distance.[SEP]if it weren't for marriott's blatantly falsely promoting this as an airport location, i'd have given it the property.three stars instead of the two.[SEP]in summation: beware of marriott and even with that caveat, try them last.
0	we stayed her for three nights.[SEP]the rooms were definitely not four star.[SEP]the toilet leaked which showed obvious signs of prior repair, the heated towel rail, the electrics did not looks safe so we did not use this.[SEP]we told the reception about the toilet on checking out and got no real response.[SEP]housekeeping would have been aware as it was obvious there was a problem with water leaking onto the floor.[SEP]the overall decor of the room was also quiet old.[SEP]however, overall the staff were friendly and we had breakfast daily which was adequate for the size of the hotel.[SEP]the supermarket opposite was useful, however there are not many restaurants in the area.[SEP]we did eat at the one opposite on two evenings which was good with the lady very friendly.[SEP]would not go back - location also even though we can access metro's easily, still felt we were not central to main attractions etc.
0	we were on a 3 week trip hitting the major spots in europe and stayed at all hilton or hilton brand hotels and this was supposed to be the " best " hotel we were staying at.[SEP]unfortunately, it didn't live up to the hype.[SEP]relatively speaking, it was the worst of the hotels we stayed at.[SEP]don't get me wrong, room patio view was great and common areas looked great too.[SEP]you will get the standard amenities, a / c, and clean rooms, but that's not what you pay extra for.[SEP]the food was beyond over priced (8 euro for an espresso, 75 euro lunch buffet per person) and average, the service was average with staff who were nice 50% of the time, the executive lounge was sub par and only open in the evening, it's not near simple conveniences like cafes or stores, and the rooms were average.[SEP]initially, i didn't mind that it wasn't centrally located because they had a shuttle taking guests downtown until i found out that you may not have a seat if you didn't show up at least 10 minutes before departure and it only ran until 8.[SEP]if your going to rome on a vacation, i suggest staying in a more central location to get the best experience possible.[SEP]many good restaurants don't even open until 8pm for dinner.
0	having read other reviews, on check in we asked for block 1200, as this was the new building.[SEP]45 minutes later they found our reservation and gave us a one bedroom apartment in this block.[SEP]we could not fault the room, nice large kitchen and bathroom that included a spa bath.[SEP]washer / dryer, nice large lounge.[SEP]my only gripe was the one double bed we had was really small!![SEP]this block was just across from the water park but the time we got back from the parks, this was closed.[SEP]it is a trek to get to one of the other pools and after a long day at the parks, to trek over put me off.[SEP]the other downside is the trip up and down the 192 from the parks.[SEP]it is about 20 - 25 mins to disney.[SEP]last thing - be careful at check in when they give you a voucher to collect your free gifts - this is a time share hard sell!!!!![SEP]rooms great - location & pools let it down![SEP]if you want to ask any other questions, give me a shout.[SEP]claire
0	my wife and i stayed in this hotel while on holiday in california for a week.[SEP]the service from the staff was good, they were very helpfull.[SEP]the rooms were nice and spacious, nice size bed but the bed we had was very skweeky.[SEP]the hotel was neat and tidy, the location was ok, but it would depend on where you would be sightseeing, we had a rented car and went all around la, so the location was ok.[SEP]there is public transport close if needed.[SEP]overall for the price we paid, it was value for money, we had free wireless internet access and it also included a nice full breakfast which is one less worry trying to find a breakfast place each morning.
0	my husband and i stayed at this lovely hotel in october, 2007.[SEP]the service is excellent, the staff gracious and helpful, the room was comfortable and clean.[SEP]the breakfast buffet is generous.[SEP]all in all it would be the perfect hotel except that it is located so far away from the rest of the city.[SEP]we had to allow for an hour to get to the main sites of rome - and that involved a bus ride and a very long walk.[SEP]we ended up relying on taxis because of the inconvenient location.[SEP]if you can get this hotel at a good price, i recommend using the savings for taxi rides.[SEP]otherwise, i would consider staying closer in to town.
0	wanted a few days away for a bit of father son bonding time and chose berlin as it was an area he had not visited.[SEP]booked with expedia, from a good number berlin hotels.[SEP]this hotel is cheap place to stay, rather than booking a twin room it was a room each at approx £ 19.00 per room per night.[SEP]this normally would have alarm bells ringing, but berlin is a cheaper city than most, and frankly this worked out to be more than value for money.[SEP]ok the good buffet breakfast was extra (15.00 euro), but this hotel is good on your pocket!.[SEP]no complaints about the staff.[SEP]the rooms are neutral, if tired, but clean and very good sized.[SEP]the bathrooms are unusually small, and the hotel is very much in the old east german vein.[SEP]the location is not ideal with little in the way of bars and restaurants nearby, but the excellent u bahn is minutes away.[SEP]would agree with other reviewers about the illicit ladies prowling the streets, but what city does not have this attraction![SEP]in all a cheap place to stay, no palace, but for the price it fits the bill!
0	i chose this hotel cause i've stayed near termini before and the area was just so filthy and crime - ridden that i couldn't stand to be near it.[SEP]for $150 a night at the rivoli, we got a room that was huge for modern roman standards with a great outdoor seating area overlooking the city.[SEP]the bathroom was enormous and filled with spa goodies.[SEP]the location is residential and quiet but quite inconvenient because cabs in rome are sooo expensive and the nearest metro stop is a 10 - 15 minute walk through the filthy pooped filled streets of rome.[SEP]only two dining options within walking distance.[SEP]but it would have still been a more pleasant stay if the reception desk would have been more helpful.[SEP]one staffer in particular (name starts with a p and ends with an o) said " i don't know " enough times to become a running joke for me and my husband the rest of the vacation.[SEP]he spoke english but couldn't help with anything, reservations, recommendations, directions.[SEP]in fact, when i asked where we could purchase a camera he literally said " walk down the busy street, you'll find a store.[SEP]" ha.[SEP]breakfast was adequate but served by a sour - pussed waiter.[SEP]i told my husband that if i ever went back to rome, i would stay near termini which is terrifying at night but termini is the station that connects you to every area you want to be in while in rome.[SEP]it's too bad this hotel couldn't be better located and better staffed.
0	i was so happy here, i forgot to take pictures.[SEP]sorry.[SEP]all the furniture in the room is updated and the bathroom is nice and clean.[SEP]no frills â€ “ but a nice place to stay.[SEP]the continental breakfast is above average, with a waffle maker and apple/ orange juice thatâ€ ™ s not from the super - concentrate machine.[SEP]the location is out of the way for vacationers (15 minutes from old town along the 8), but if your going to be at ucsd â€ “ this is the place to stay.[SEP]the staff was excellent on both shifts and we will return.
0	hotel and room clean.[SEP]not a particularly good location at the end of the' strip' would like to have been in the middle of strip.[SEP]we got robbed in the middle of the night while we were sleeping in our room.[SEP]hotel staff investigated it and then told us they are not taking responsibility for what happened, basically did not want to know.[SEP]obviously an' inside' job as who else could have access to your room at 3 am and get in so easily.[SEP]disappointed that no one got caught for doing this to us.
0	i travel a lot for business and found this hotel to be very disappointing.[SEP]the hotel is very overpriced compared to other, better hotels in singapore.[SEP]the hotel is more on equal footing with a holiday inn rather than a boutique hotel, at almost double the prices.[SEP]amenities are basic.[SEP]the highlight being the rooftop bar, which offered limited range of drinks.[SEP]the restaurant was sterile, with no ambiance.[SEP]the waiters were friendly and accommodating, however the service desk were quite rude and indifferent.[SEP]the location is at the centre of a busy intersection, so you can hear the noise from the traffic in the room.[SEP]although the room was clean, it smelt of dirty drain water unless the air conditioning was kept on.[SEP]i soon learned why the room was freezing cold after the cleaner's visit.[SEP]i would not recommend this hotel, unless it was the only available hotel left in singapore.[SEP]unfortunately, this was my experience as i was travelling on business.
0	the riviera hotel is certainly not comparible to the many new and bigger hotels on the vegas strip.[SEP]the casino is on the small side and " older " looking and the shops / facilities aren't top notch.[SEP]however, our hotel room was lovely and maid service was great.[SEP]we stayed in one of the signature rooms, the most updated hotel room the riviera offers.[SEP]it had a new and very comfortable bed, linens, and bathroom was big and clean.[SEP]check in did take about 20 minutes and the hotel adds fees each night, i believe it was $7 extra.[SEP]the location wasn't bad either, a 10 minute walk from all the other newer casinos, but " the deuce " bus was able to take us all along the strip and had a stop right in front of the riviera.
0	the only good thing about this hotel is the location.[SEP]the only good thing about this hotel is the location.[SEP]paid extra for the city view room which we did not get.[SEP]the room was not overly clean.[SEP]found the staff unhelpful and long waits for the uninterested concierge.[SEP]would never stay here again, very dissapointed.
0	stayed here for one night.[SEP]the hotel itself is perfectly adequate: clean, up to date with good internet access and friendly staff.[SEP]breakfast is ok.[SEP]for the price it is very good.[SEP]only thing to watch out for is the location.[SEP]while it is near all the sights it is one block away from the red light district which has some unsavoury characters walking around it (and using the phone booths to relieve themselves.)
0	i recently stayed at the nh caransa for 3 nights.[SEP]the hotel rooms were spacious and modern.[SEP]however, our room faced the square that has a lot of night life.[SEP]i was kept up all night by the sounds of the neighboring bars and the people outside the hotel.[SEP]additionally, we requested a wake up call that we never received.[SEP]we made a comment to the front desk as the next day we would be traveling and we needed a wake up call to get to the airport on time.[SEP]we did not receive this wake up call and when we went downstairs, the person working the front desk was sleeping.[SEP]overall, the actual hotelroom was nice but the staff and location were not ideal.
0	reception is a joke.[SEP]the rooms look ok, but they are dirty and dusty.[SEP]i would go into detail but really, take my word its bad.[SEP]the air con sounds like its generating enough cool air to freeze the artic, but its not the case, you could get cooler air from a volcano.[SEP]the area is shocking, and you would never walk around alone and you are in the middle of no where and a horrible location at that.[SEP]if you want sleep forget it.[SEP]the disco is open until 5 am..[SEP]and its starts at 1 am.[SEP]its so loud you will not sleep, i say this as i ve just come back from the hotel, and can not belive the noise from the club into the room with the windows closed.[SEP]boom boom, boom boom!![SEP]the breakfast at best was shocking for 14 euros, so toast and jam it was.[SEP]the staff offer as much help as a lame dog on a race track..[SEP]good points, well leaving and knowing my boss booked here for a business trip and it was nt my money and i would never go back.[SEP]really if you want a hotel, do nt book here, unless you want the party life and then yes you will be happy with the club next door.[SEP]if you want sleep, or in a couple who would like a nice trip away, then belive me, just do nt do nt go here, you will wish you had not.!!
0	a bunch of wanna - be trendees in a plastic hotel that is impossible to cover up small rooms with incredibly small bathrooms with ikea furniture and plastic over - priced everything else.[SEP]we were part of a wedding party that had a large block of rooms - the comments above reflect not only the consensus of our group, but also that of another wedding party for the same night.[SEP]the sentiment was universally held by 20-somethings to 60-somethings.[SEP]the price of the rooms was exorbitant and the value was ridiculous.[SEP]we stayed at the knickerbocker earlier in the week on the north end of michigan av for half the price ; double the room size ; exemplary concierge service and great location.[SEP]we've been in a dozen other chicago hotels in the loop, michigan av, oakbrook, and lincoln park areas... all significantly better!
0	this hotel is in the middle of no where.[SEP]the hotel states on the web says right crossed the road is water bus.[SEP]but in fact it's in the middle of camp site.[SEP]you get off water bus from lido, need to walk 1 km, there is a bus run every half an hour.[SEP]when we finally found this hotel, we asked them to give refund, because they have lied about their location.[SEP]the receptionist is very rude, call me b*tch, we ask her to apologise, she would nt do it.[SEP]also we booked the place through placetostay.com, she kept saying some speedo website.[SEP]she would nt listen and was going to charge us 2 nights before we even check in.[SEP]i wo nt stay in this hotel for ever, even they give me a free stay!!![SEP]it's all lie and rudeness!!
0	we stayed here for 3 nights based on good reviews.[SEP]firstly, to get there from marco polo airport get the alilaguna red line (linea rossa) and get off a the lido (casino) it will cost you 25 euro each for a return ticket purchased at the airport.[SEP]it takes about 1 hr.[SEP]when you get off you are literally 20 m from the hotel - perfect![SEP]when i rang the hotel from the uk they told me to get the blue line, which stops at the lideo (sme) - which is a good 20/25 min walk with luggage - or get a taxi.[SEP]the reception staff are not friendly nor informative.[SEP]when i asked for the location of a nearest supermarket, the reply was vague and not specific - poor show.[SEP]the room was small, dark and cramped.[SEP]the hotel grounds where unkempt and furniture was past it's best.[SEP]the atmosphere felt unwelcoming and we never saw anyone in the bar.[SEP]it appears everyone just used this as a base.[SEP]my advise is book early and get a hotel on venice island - after all that's what you've come to see!
0	i stayed at the ramada plaza while attending a birthday party in toronto.[SEP]it was a great location, minus all the construction going on.[SEP]we had a nice room, and had no noise complaints.[SEP]my only issue with the hotel is the height of the shower heads in the bathroom.[SEP]i'm not that tall (5'5 "), the shower head was too low.[SEP]i had to tilt my head back in order to get my head under it.[SEP]other than that, it served it's purpose.
0	the other reviews are true, i will not mention again the location and prices.[SEP]what i did not like at all was the way they handled my credit card.[SEP]first of all they've tried to pre - authorized my card for the amount of full stay + 30%.[SEP]i've explicitly has told them not to do that as i do not possess an extra 2000 eur in my account.[SEP]they pre - authorized 1000 eur which was ok.[SEP]later on they did more pre - authorizations without letting me know, so by the end of my stay the whole bill was pre - authorized.[SEP]on the check - out they successfully debited my account for the same amount.[SEP]i know the hotel wants to be on the safe side, but in this case they must release all the pre - authorizations as soon as i pay my bill.[SEP]now i am forced to go into overdraft and pay debit interest on my account just because rome marriott park hotel is soooooo clever.[SEP]and to be honest, the level of service is crap even by italian standards.
0	i arrived for the first of two nights but left asap, willingly forfeiting paid dues.[SEP]lobby, initial check - in person, and room had decent mid - range qualities.[SEP]room seemed clean and quiet.[SEP]free in - room wireless internet worked well ; just had to login on telus interface every session.[SEP]on the other hand, there was running heat but it was not effective.[SEP]dark hallway felt desolate and unsafe.[SEP]hotel restaurant / lounge was worse than if one never existed.[SEP]it looked dead even at dinner hour, and there was a closure sign in front of one section.[SEP]a polite enquiry with on - duty front desk was met with apparent deceit.[SEP]location was a bit scary.[SEP]there is youth drop - in centre within one block off of granville street, at least partly accounting for many groups of men or youths loitering on nearby streets.[SEP]there were also quite a few homeless persons (more than elsewhere), and they can be quite forward.[SEP]there were also sleazy tattoo parlours and porn shops on this stretch of granville.[SEP]cost benefit tradeoffs were not worthwhile - especially for females, families or single travelers.
0	we stayed here one night over labor day weekend while meeting up with my in - laws and our son in college.[SEP]we had three rooms total, which were all good size.[SEP]the king suite was actually two rooms combined into one.[SEP]we wanted to stay downtown, but nothing was available in our price range.[SEP]this hotel is not a bad location, just one block off i-240 and 10 minutes from downtown.[SEP]i really don't have anything good or bad to say about it.[SEP]the staff was friendly, the hotel was clean and safe.[SEP]i would stay again for one night, especially if i had a flight out the next morning, but i don't think i would make it a base for a multi - night stay.
0	we loved the hotel, the only down side was the location which is a bit far from the center.[SEP]we knew about it though, so it wasn't an issue for us.[SEP]the train station is literally 15 seconds walking from the hotel and the area is full of restaurants and markets.[SEP]the room and bathroom were cute, the bed was really comfy![SEP]there was no train rumble as we asked for an upper room.[SEP]the breakfast guy (can't remember his name) was lovely and couldn't do enough to help us![SEP]excellent value for money!
0	we visited hong kong quite frequently during the past decade, but this was our first stay in this hotel.[SEP]it is a new hotel in a dilapidated neighhood.[SEP]there are many shops and restaurants nearby.[SEP]since we speak mandarin and cantonese, we had no problems venturing the neighborhood.[SEP]the room is of a decent size by hong kong standard.[SEP]the main drawback of the hotel is its location.[SEP]the nearest subway station in mongkok is 2 km away.[SEP]the hotel does provide free shuttle bus service to tsimshatsui and hunghom mtr station at an interval of 20 - 40 minutes, with occasional services to airpot express kowloon station.[SEP]boarding the bus at the hotel is not a problem as there is a staff to maintain order.[SEP]it is a different story at the pick - up point in tst.[SEP]guests rush to get in the bus.[SEP]if you can't get in, you can wait for the next bus and try your luck.[SEP]or else, you can take a taxi back to the hotel ; the fare is around hkd40 (not bad for a party of 2 - 4).[SEP]if the hotel is nearer to any of the mtr stations along the nathan road, i would give it a 4-star rating.
0	we've stayed in the hyde park hotel in october 2010.[SEP]the hotel itself is quite nice, rooms are small but not shabby, looking as they have recently been refurbished, left overall feeling of freshness and cleanliness.[SEP]bayswater as a location is great, easy access to everything and 24hr buses to the area but the hotel is much further from the station than it seems onthe map.[SEP]it is actualy 10 minutes walk by the streets looking all the same way.[SEP]for me personally it was tough and that's why i've got lost so many times on the way back to the hotel (probably it is all my topographic cretinism, but comment may be valuable for people who struggle with topography).[SEP]it was quite cool outside so the room was not warm as their heating system didn't work.[SEP]we immediately got the small heater from receiption.[SEP]overall staff is very nice, with heater, iron, directions and numerous questions we've asked they were always friendly and willing to help.[SEP]there is a very comfortable service in the hotel - they can order a shuttle bus to heathrow for 12gbp only, it is cheaper then tube and definitely much more comfortable.[SEP]they have small " office " corner where you can check you email and they also allow you to print out with no charge.[SEP]it was a pleasant experience inside the hotel but if you could move it a little bit closer to the tube / bus stop...
0	first i would like explain why i said it was a bad location.[SEP]this hotel claims to be downtown but it is on the edge of downtown which means a long walk to downtown (which i wanted to avoid).[SEP]the rooms were small and difficult to move around ; a long mirror would have been nice.[SEP]the staff is ok, nothing special, considering that you are supposed to be staying at a 4 star hotel.[SEP]i would definetely not go back to this hotel.[SEP]the walks to downtown wouldn't be bad if the weather was nice but since it was raining all the time, it was just annoying... it is an option if you are in vancouver for the hospital ; it is literally across the street
0	pretty touristy location and unremarkable hotel.[SEP]i stayed here because it was only two metro stops to my office in la, but what i saved on cabs staying in hotels elsewhere in the city, i spent on the internet access in the room.[SEP]$13 a day, which feels a little unrealistic these days.[SEP]also, i fail to understand why the hotel's website has rooms decked out in funky, bright colours.[SEP]no pictures posted here, nor the room i stayed in, has decor in anything but white and cream.[SEP]where are these rooms??[SEP]if you want to be in the thick of hollywood - walk of fame, touristy shops everywhere you look, right next to a mall etc - this is for you.[SEP]as a business hotel, i'm not sure it makes the grade next to other places i've stayed in la.
0	we checked into hotel vintage park on 6 november and couldn't have enjoyed a more fantastic stay.[SEP]from check - in to check - out, hotel vintage park was a totally pleasant experience.[SEP]the hotel is in a good location and within walking distance to most downtown seattle attractions and the waterfront.[SEP]everybody on staff was friendly and helpful, and we felt like valued, welcome guests.[SEP]the hotel is very attractive, and our king premier room was well appointed, comfortable, and quiet.[SEP]hotel vintage park also hosts a complimentary wine - tasting each evening, featuring wines from around washington state.[SEP]delicious hors d' oeuvres were also served to accompany the wines.[SEP]we felt our room was very well priced, considering the quality of the hotel, its staff, and our room, and we will look forward to staying in hotel vintage park during our next visit to seattle.
0	we were on a busy tour, and unfortunately this was our first hotel for 3 nights.[SEP]whilst the location was good, and very central (less than 1 km from the main sites), that's about all that was good.[SEP]location - opposite a disco.[SEP]rooms at the back were quiet, but those facing the road were very noisy.[SEP]room facilities - adequate, although the step into / out of the shower cubicle was so high that anyone under five foot tall is risking life and limb getting out![SEP](although to be fair, this was common in some of the other hotels we stayed at).[SEP]empty minibar.[SEP]room safe did not work.[SEP]staffing - disinterested.[SEP]food- although the panoramic views from the restaurant were great, the food wasn't up to scratch for a four star hotel
0	i went to this hotel for a getaway with girlfriends and my daughter.[SEP]we arrived at 3:30 and they would not let us check in until their 4 pm check - in time![SEP]it is a nice looking hotel and the room was adequate with pretty comfortable beds.[SEP]the room was also very clean which really is one of my most important features of a hotel.[SEP]however for what we paid this place is way overpriced.[SEP]first, it is a crummy location and the area there is not easy to get around in as far as where downtown is located and parking downtown stinks![SEP]the hotel offers breakfast but it is not complimentary and it is very expensive, $12 for juice and a muffin... they leave a newspaper at the door but it is also not free.[SEP]the coffee in the morning was pretty good but they ran out early and there was never many helpful people around.[SEP]the pool was nice though and there is an hour of wine tasting in the afternoon.[SEP]the spa next door was also really overpriced as well (maybe i am just cheap though!?)they would not take my 12 year old daughter either.[SEP]we ended up going to the beauty college downtown and they were excellent!!great facials and wonderful spa pedicures, the girls were really friendly and it was very clean.[SEP]they were also really great with my daughter who was having her first facial.[SEP]i do not think would return to this hotel or this area, calistoga is much better for a spa trip.
0	i spent three days in vegas as part of a larger trip.[SEP]i had nt stayed at the mgm for many years, but we were looking for a cheap stay and they had a great deal on bungalow suites - $120ish a night - so for that price i thought why not.[SEP]the room was a great size although a bit shabby.[SEP]there was a mini - bar with nothing inside it - which was annoying since it is always so far to go down to the casino for a drink late at night.[SEP]i certainly would nt be paying much more for the room than what i did.[SEP]the bed was huge and comfortable.[SEP]the bed linen was suprisingly decent - and had obviously been refreshed more recently than the hotel room itself!![SEP]the bathroom was acceptable but also in need of a refurb, the towels were average.[SEP]wireless internet access is charged on a daily basis which i think is a bit tight - in this day and age it should be complimentary.[SEP]the hotel is basically straight down the middle in terms of quality, a standard strip hotel - no more no less.[SEP]casino is fine, restaurants, pool etc are fine.[SEP]its not going to set the world on fire, but then at the price i was paying who cares.[SEP]unfortunately the location these days leaves a lot to be desired.[SEP]usually i stay up at the bellagio junction which is much more convenient for shopping, eating and nightlife.[SEP]the mgm is just a bit too far away from the action.
0	i stayed at this hotel on the 28th of november 2007 and have mixed conclusions of the experience.[SEP]my trip was for business and the hotel was dictated by our associate or we would never have considered this venue.[SEP]the hotel itself is very very clean, in every way and the reception staff were reasonably helpful.[SEP]we also had wifi in the room.[SEP]that's where it stopped.[SEP]the rooms are small, very small.[SEP]there are 11 tv channels, 10 in spanish and 1 other, cnn.[SEP]pay tv was not working.[SEP]do not pay for breakfast.[SEP]it's rubbish.[SEP]after taking a look over the offering, we chose to go out for breakfast.[SEP]we would have liked a bar or lounge to meet in or wind up or down![SEP]no such luck.[SEP]the location is rubbish too.[SEP]there are no good bars or restaurants in walking distance.[SEP]so if you want small, clean and wifi only, this cheap hotel is for you.[SEP]if you need a bar or lounge and fancy some tv late at night or a tasty meal.[SEP]steer clear.[SEP]we won't be back.
0	i have been to this hotel three times in the last year, mainly for business reasons.[SEP]it is a nice 4 * hotels with all the amenities you need.[SEP]staff is nice and efficient.[SEP]not so nice is the fact that you have to pay at the arrival, which i found quite strange.[SEP]however, rooms are spacious, and very very clean.[SEP]some rooms need some more maintainance: in the last one in which i have been the window was not closing properly.... luckly outside temperature was perfect.[SEP]as i said i was there for business reasons, so i did not care about the location with respect to main turistic areas.[SEP]however if you go there for turistic reasons consider that the area is quite far from the main attractions and that you necessarily need to take the metro to go to the city center (or walk 30 - 40 minutes to get to the " born "), also in this area it is quite difficult to find a restaurant (outside the hotel one) to have dinner.[SEP]so you would need to take the metro also to have a dinner in the city center.[SEP]on the other hand this make it possible to have a quite good price / quality ratio in comparison to other solutions in barcelona.[SEP]in sum if you do not mind taking the metro to visit the city and have a dinner in a good restaurant, this might be a good solution.[SEP]otherwise search for something closer to the main attractions area.
0	we book the trip through ba and thought radisson 5 star you can't go wrong.[SEP]mistake!!![SEP]the rooms are a little quirky but i can live with that, but they are also very tired and in need of some refurbishment.[SEP]the bath has a wood surround which has been painted orange.[SEP]this paint has now started to peel off around the taps.[SEP]the bath is also chipped which adds to the ambiance.[SEP]i did complain to reception but the young lady just tutted and got the porter to show us another room which was equally as tatty.[SEP]also, don't share a room in this hotel unless you are at one with you fellow traveller as the bathroom is part of the bedroom and the toilet does not have a proper closing door.[SEP]i have to agree with some of the reviews with regards to location, this hotel is not in a nice area and the front of the hotel is often used by skateboarders.[SEP]the one thing that is definitely 5 star about this hotel is the bar € 18 for two glasses of wine.[SEP]but to finish on a positive note the breakfast was good with plenty of choice and the staff with the exception of the receptionist were very friendly.
0	i have stayed at the rio 3x due to a convention on site.[SEP]i pay $89 for a large suite.[SEP]while it is the best location for the convention, it is not the best hotel for the strip.[SEP]you will have to take a cab to the strip (there is a free shuttle) and back.[SEP]the casino is very smokey.[SEP]the restaurants are ok.[SEP]i have eaten multiple times at the world buffet, buizo's seafood and gaylord indian.[SEP]i would eat there again.[SEP]if there are more than 3 of you and you will share the room and cab fees, then this is an option.[SEP]the rooms were clean, products ok and casino fine.[SEP]the spa is not great but the prices reflect that.[SEP]i have not had time to visit the pool, but it looks fun.[SEP]no free coffee in the suite but there is a refrigerator separate from the mini bar.
0	the hotel is perfectly adequate.[SEP]clean, good size rooms, nice breakfast included in price.[SEP]found the staff very nice and helpful.[SEP]i really did not like the location though.[SEP]the distance from central paris is a factor, and more than that, the area around the hotel is really not very nice.[SEP]i would not have felt confortable walking at night from the metro.[SEP]given paris prices this hotel ought to be looked at as an option, but if you have only few days in paris and are with younger family i would really not recommend it.
0	better be in good shape if you stay out here.[SEP]the location is about a 20 minute, 1-euro, many stop bus ride to downtown.[SEP]and, that requires a 5 - 10 minute, mostly uphill walk to the bus stop.[SEP](the hotel has a one - trip, free shuttle you can reserve, but it only seats eight people -- you do the math!) the room: our first room on the 1st floor was awful -- crammed, noisy all night and early am -- thin walls.[SEP]also there was a notch out of a metal piece on the outside door -- apparently forced open (maybe by a guest).[SEP]no chain or peep hole on hallway door.[SEP]couldn't sleep![SEP]the unhelpful guy at the desk suggested we keep it, that it was as good as it gets.[SEP]i almost did![SEP]our second room was a big improvement -- spacious, reasonably quiet, not at street level![SEP]this may account for differing opinions.[SEP]the neighborhood is nice -- some upscale cars at the neighboring apartments ; good pizza place, and a snack bar nextdoor, a few minutes away.[SEP]best of zone... great full breakfast, wonderful meats.[SEP]worst... front desk (& cab drivers) not friendly or real helpful.[SEP](fyi: it cost 22 and over 24 euros, respectively, to get to and from the main train station (termini) in town.)
0	if there is anything good to say about this hotel, it would be that it is very close to the red line metro train and the beds had decent comfort.[SEP]the location is not in the best neighborhood although there is a denny's down the street.[SEP]upon entering the lobby, it was obvious that this was going to be a pretty run down hotel.[SEP]unfortunately, i was not able to get a refund of the reward points i used to book the hotel.[SEP]the elevator is old, hallways and carpets are old and not very flattering, and you are greeted with a camera at the front of each hallways.[SEP]the tub in the first room we were assigned was filthy.[SEP]we requested and received a new room on a different floor.[SEP]surprise, same experience.[SEP]the tub was at least cleaner this time and the room smelled better.[SEP]the cleanliness is more a reflection of how old and run down the hotel is overall.[SEP]i am sure the housekeeping does as good a job as they can with what they are provided.
0	stayed here twice - once with a car and once without.[SEP]this is a recently renovated hotel with large rooms, that are very clean.[SEP]the rooms were certainly the best feature of the hotel.[SEP]each room was equiped with a refrigerator and single cup coffeemaker.[SEP]the price was very good too ($104/night).[SEP]the hotel served a decent breakfast buffet, but the cost was high.[SEP]free internet was fast.[SEP]there was no restaurant to speak of, only a bar and bistro that served wraps and burgers behind a glass counter.[SEP]the location is relatively poor.[SEP]located right off an major interstate - there is considerable road noise.[SEP]there are no restaurants within a short walking distance except the expensive restaurants at the town and country resort across the highway.[SEP]most restaurants 1 mile away - far for walking at night, but ok if you have a car.[SEP]the hotel charges a large parking fee ($14/day) making the cost of keeping a car high.[SEP]i think next time i will stay near downtown - which is a better location for walking around.[SEP]however, the price of this location is a detinite plus for the quality of room.[SEP]so if price / value for nice room is your criteria and you don't care about location - this is your place.[SEP]but if location is important - there are better choices downtown.
0	average rooms, needs some basic updates (bedspreads, curtains, etc).[SEP]service was just adequate as we were given incorrect instructions regarding busses, etc.[SEP](however excellent at breakfast) location okay (15 min walk to metro) but not really central to main tourist district.[SEP]we found this awkward as we would want to go back to our hotel during the afternoon siestas (when everything was closed) but it was a lot of traveling to head back to the touristy area in the evening.[SEP]overall, experience was okay, but not at 250 canadian dollars per night
0	my husband and i stayed at this hotel for 2 nights at the end of feb.[SEP]we did not like it at all.[SEP]our first impression was " how nice' but then we got to our room!!!!,,we were given a room with 2 single beds..[SEP]hubby was nt impressed..[SEP]but on top of that it was a smoking room and absolutely stunk of cigarette smoke.[SEP]there was no clock or radio either.[SEP]the breakfast was only passable.[SEP]i did nt like the location as it was further away from chinatown than we expected.[SEP]i would nt recommend this hotel to anyone.
0	i booked this hotel instead of a hostel as i had read bad reviews about hostels in vegas.[SEP]when i got there i found a dirty room with bits of tissue all over the floor!?![SEP]without apology i was given another room which was smaller, and though clean the bath was still dirty.[SEP]this was not the cheapest hotel i found on the stip but thought i would pay to feel safe and comfortable, but it did nt have the ameneties i always find in basic travel lodges/ holiday inns, etc- no drinks facilities in the room, no hair conditioner, i couldn't believe breakfast wasn't included, and as it is far from the centre of the strip you don't even pay for location![SEP]the water in the cold tap was hot too- not pleasent when brushing your teeth![SEP]all of these things may seem little but for the price i paid i'd expect a much higher standard of customer service.[SEP]i think this hotel has had its day and people should choose from all the other hotels on the strip- i wish i had stayed at the luxor as it is much cheaper and i have heard only posotove things about it!
0	rooms too hot so windows have to be opened which lets the noise in of a jumbo passing over every 2 min.[SEP]three channels on the tv.[SEP]whole room on a slant.[SEP]key cards worked in day but not in the morning.[SEP]pool table over priced.[SEP]photos on website do not reflect reality.[SEP]steady stream of people interested in a room for only two hours... out of date website (2005).[SEP]no wifi.[SEP]nice location, close to resteraunts, shops, supermarket ect.
0	at first, it seemed as if the hotel was a nice place with a high standard.[SEP]but that changed.[SEP]we had paid ekstra to get a better room, and the room in itself was ok, but the location was terrible.[SEP]no balcony, and view was to a narrow alley.[SEP]traffic noise at all hours, and the hotel had a bar which kept playing music at disco - high levels until 3 am in the morning, so sleep was impossible.[SEP]luckily, we had brought earplugs, but the cleaning - staff threw them away, and though we complained, the hotel staff did nothing to reimburse us or buy us new ones.[SEP]breakfast was ok, but not a 4 star level - and the reataurant looks like a cheap diner or cafeteria.[SEP]not recommendable, since dubai has so many other hotels to choose from.
0	you definitely get what you pay for with this hotel.[SEP]very cheap, at around $60/night.[SEP]location is so - so, 10 - 15 miles from downtown la, but this can take more than one hour in the traffic.[SEP]you will definitely need a car, very limited public transport available.[SEP]alhambra is not a beautiful place- not too many good restaurants around and not much to do at all![SEP]there are a few supermarkets about 5 mins drive away, however.[SEP]room was not very large.[SEP]had a strange chemical smell which persisted throughout our stay.[SEP]king bed, tv, microwave, fridge, hairdryer, desk, table and two chairs provided.[SEP]not very clean.[SEP]chairs were heavily stained and carpet had many sticky spots.[SEP]stains on the walls and doors.[SEP]furniture was dated.[SEP]bathroom was ok - looked like it been refurbished recently.[SEP]free internet via ethernet cable connection.[SEP]very fast connection.[SEP]rooms were very quiet at night.[SEP]request a room away from huntington for a quieter night.[SEP]free breakfast provided consisted of pastries, muffins, cereal, toast, tea and coffee.[SEP]coffee available in the lobby 24/7.[SEP]service was average, front desk was not very friendly.[SEP]free parking.
0	the hotel itself was so nice.[SEP]everything was clean and in really great condition in the lobby and room.[SEP]the bed was wonderful![SEP]the bathroom was small, but nice.[SEP]i had a corner room with 2 windows - cool views of the city.[SEP]the restaurant / bar was great, too![SEP]had several appetizers and wasn't disappointed.[SEP]the gym could use some new equipment though.[SEP]the tv didn't work on one machine and the incline didn't work on the other.[SEP]my biggest complaint is something the hotel can't do much about - location, location, location.[SEP]it's not at union square.[SEP]when we pulled up in the cab, our driver told us not to walk around the outside of the hotel.[SEP]basically it was a rough neighborhood, heard it called the tenderloin, along with a lot of homeless.[SEP]we did walk to the street car once, which isn't through the worst part, but as a young woman i probably wouldn't do it alone.[SEP]if you want to stay a really comfortable hotel with great service, but can take a car directly from the door - then this one might work for you.[SEP]i'll be trying some other options.
0	we stayed two nights at this hotel and had a pretty good stay.[SEP]pros: - nice indoor swimming pool with excellent view of the city - joes diner for breakfast (located at the corner of 44th street/2 ave) - the room was very clean - comfortable bed - minibar with great selection of drinks and snacks - friendly and helpfull staff - we had a nice view ofer the river.[SEP]i would think that the rooms facing towards the city have a really great view as well cons: - decor (tacky lobby with black tiles, mirrors + gold) and the room felt like ikea - dated bathroom and toilet that did not work properly - expensive wifi ($13 for 24h.[SEP]it was also very slow) - location.[SEP]grand central is within walking distance, but even though we do a lot of walking when on holliday we thought the walk to the closest subway was too far.[SEP]it took quite a long time if you in the middle of the day wanted to stop by the hotell just to drop of some shoppingbags or whatever.[SEP]as already stated, we had a good stay, but the cons are bigger than the pros.[SEP]especially the location does that we will not stay at this hotell again.
0	my experience as follows: 1st an unbelievable rate to start with: i stumbled upon an unbelievable rate which i booked immediately w/o hesitation.[SEP]$14 a night incl taxes.[SEP]this is the thread where it all started (http://las-vegas-hotels.tripadvisor.com/showtopic-g45963-i10-k2317252-unbelievable_offer_any_catch-las_vegas_nevada.html) 2nd.[SEP]i tried to do the $20 trick to get an upgrade (the check in staff didn't know how much i was paying.[SEP]failed![SEP]3rd.[SEP]when my kid opened the minibar and moved some of the items, it immediately triggered charges to the room account.[SEP]note: item moved = hotel will assume it has been consumed.[SEP]i called to front desk to explain and they happily credited back the charges.[SEP]4th when i checked out, i was shocked to find $239 charged to my room as room rate.[SEP]i spoke to e front desk, they are equally puzzled too as mine's supposed to be pre - paid.[SEP]they promised credit card won't be charged and gave me a guest services manager's card in case.[SEP]2 days later, my card was charged.[SEP]i tried many times to reach that manager but can't.[SEP]finally i spoke to another gsm and he promised to take care of it.[SEP]the charge was finally reversed few days later.[SEP]ok room wise, its pretty standard according to vegas standards.[SEP]nothing fanciful.[SEP]location is off - strip, so u probably want to have a car to get you around.
0	the hilton garden inn is located on a side street of canal street.[SEP]though this is very close to the french quarter itself, the somewhat sketchy walk through these side streets made me wary of staying there alone.[SEP]beside its location, the hotel and its staff were wonderful.[SEP]there was a tendency for loud yelling at 3 am in the morning as college - age students returned from their shenanigans on burbon street.[SEP]i would recommend this hotel if you have someone to stay and walk with and if you can get a special deal that includes free parking (it is a 26 dollar fee otherwise).
0	nice hotel with good little features such as an evening cookies reception and a car to drop off guests locally.[SEP]we were there on business - the location in downtown dallas was a little off - putting to out - of - towners and we certainly weren't venturing too far from the hotel on foot in the evening.[SEP]there is a complimentary cocktail hour but we only went once and the barman had such a bad attitude that i am not sure it could be considered a plus for the hotel.[SEP]good friendly valet service and rooms nicely appointed.[SEP]no room safe though which really irks me.
0	when people say this hotel needs updating, trust me: that is all they mean.[SEP]the kitchen and bathroom tiles and fixtures are a little worn.[SEP]nothing was broken or dirty or in disrepair.[SEP]the only complaint i had was with the dirty, threadbare ironing board cover.[SEP]the room was spacious, bright and clean, and the bed was very comfortable.[SEP]they charge for internet usage, but you can print your boarding pass with no charge.[SEP]as everyone has said, the doormen are very friendly and helpful.[SEP]all in all, it can not be beat for $125 through priceline.[SEP]i was not crazy about the location, although the 51st & lexington metro station is nearby.[SEP]many nights after the theater, i simply walked down 45th, then up to the hotel.[SEP]greenacre park nearby is lovely and peaceful, and several restaurants and drugstores are nearby.[SEP]i only go on at length because some of these reviews make the beekman tower sound like a run - down dump.[SEP]that is very, very far from the truth.
0	there is nothing wrong with this hotel, although that is to say there is also nothing wonderful about it.[SEP]it is new and clean and the rooms are nice.[SEP]it is convenient enough, although not is the best location.[SEP]what this hotel lacks is class, style and character.[SEP]it is simply a modern functional hotel which does its job well as a hotel.[SEP]i will stay here again but only as a backup.[SEP]it won't be my first choice.
0	we are so sorry we stayed here.[SEP]we do not feel that we got value for our money.[SEP]hotel room had a very tired look, though the lobby and pool area were very well kept.[SEP]if you are hoping to do sightseeing pick a more central location.[SEP]i must agree with other reviewers, the parking cost is a bit high considering the location of the hotel.[SEP]i am sure the hotel management will respond with a comparison to other more centrally located areas(which wouldn't make for a true comparison) but we found that public parking downtown actually offered more competitive rates.[SEP]after two nights here we left and went to the fairmont royal york and had the best stay.[SEP]this is not the place you want to take your family for a nice toronto stay.[SEP]while it is not the worst hotel, it is certainly not among the best.[SEP]after reading the hotel management responses we should have been more suspicious.[SEP]despite what management says to defend itself i am genuinely suggesting you pick another hotel if you have that option.
0	always remember you will get what you pay for there is a reason why this place is so cheap!![SEP]it was horrible, to the point where we could not stay in the hotel we checked in and shortly there after checked out and booked another hotel.[SEP]the room door handles fell off there was a deadbolt which locked the door yes but the staff downstairs kept one set of keys because they couldn't find it... yea real safe![SEP]the bathroom had nothing in it the beds had stains on the sheets and just the general appearance of the hallways and carpets looked like you'd leave there with some sort of disease.[SEP]the breakfast offered downstairs was out when we arrived and it looked as if bugs were going to come out of the baskets the smell was horrible as well.[SEP]not to mention the thugish looking groups of guys constantly outside the hotel doors.[SEP]overall just not a good location nor hotel.[SEP]the only positive was the receptionist we spoke with was very friendly.
0	at the end of the new strip, good if you want to visit the " welcome to las vegas " sign but a long walk to the heart of the action (ceasers, bellagio & all the shopping etc).[SEP]luckily got a free room upgrade to the newly refurished rooms in tower 2, rooms in tower 1 run down and old, the casio is the same but good if you want to play on the lower priced tables.[SEP]for what i paid i was happy and we wasn't in the hotel much at all, but wouldn't have wanted to pay full price or for the room upgrade.[SEP]overall the hotel was ok but would recommend you pay that little bit more for a better location.[SEP]if your thinking of visting vegas i would definatelty recommend, it is wicked!!!!
0	first of all, stratosphere is located right up north on the strip.[SEP]meaning that if your ideal mode of transport along the strip is walking, do not choose to stay at stratosphere simply because it's too far from the main attractions on the strip, that are located in the middle of further down south.[SEP]plus, the hot weather does not exactly encourage long walks.[SEP]the rooms were small but decent and the only thing i did not really like about it would be the lack of coffee makers in the room.[SEP]if you're carrying lots of luggage, take note that the carpark is located a distance away from the rooms.[SEP]you'd have to walk through the casino in order to get to the lifts.[SEP]more walking to do as well, not much of a worry unless you're carrying heavy baggages.[SEP]overall, i would definitely not stay at the hotel again mainly due to its location.
0	very good i had a good deal in this hotel through expedia.[SEP]it was all worth it, great room space in hk standards, very clean, healpfull and generous staff.[SEP]simply, it's all what you can ask for.[SEP]like any other thing in life, it's not perfect.[SEP]the only drawback i can find on this hotel is its location.[SEP]it's quite far from city center and from where all the fun is.[SEP](which means gon na make you pay extra for transportaion within hk), although it is less than a minute walk to the mtr station.
0	i stayed at the hotel for a week.[SEP]nice bathroom and the bed is pretty soft - great for a good night sleep.[SEP]the condition of the hotel is good.[SEP]it is off a nice quiet location right by the marina, but it is away from the main " happening " area at 7th street.[SEP]the food at the restaurant is pretty alright but i find it expensive.[SEP]there are a few good eating places near the hotel though.[SEP]small fitness room but nice outdoor pool.[SEP]i would not really stay here if i do not have business at the marina or in the area.[SEP]other dislikes 1.[SEP]no complimentary water 2.[SEP]the offers high speed internet for $13 per day although there is complimentary wireless connection at the lobby.[SEP]i find this expensive considering that i m paying more than $100 per night.[SEP]hint: get a room near the lobby if you do not believe in paying for internet.
0	my husband and i stayed at the pulitzer for 5 nights.[SEP]this hotel is not convenient for tourism.[SEP]while it is true it is close to the metro.[SEP]you have several stops before any attractions and the metro is packed, dirty, not air conditioned and graffiti.[SEP]the price is still steep for the location and the room wasn't much better than a marriott at home.[SEP]pictures on website are a bit deceiving.[SEP]the problem came when we came back to the hotel every night between 10:30 and 11 pm.[SEP]there are prostitutes all up and down the avenue!!![SEP]so as you are walking back from the metro to your hotel you are bombarded by women with bras showing and butt cheeks hanging out.[SEP]i was horrified and immediately felt unsafe.[SEP]there are no security measures in the hotel and often at night front desk person is hanging out in the back chatting![SEP]anybody can come in or out, and you do not need a card to go up or down the elevators.[SEP]stay somewhere else close to the tourist attractions, even if it is older and rooms are not as nice.[SEP]or spend a little more.[SEP]whatever you do.... this hotel is not worth it!
0	a very posh hotel, extremely clean, staff are very professional, overly ornate.[SEP]due to the location, extremely expensive to travel to and from hotel via taxi or bus shuttles to major attractions in the orlando area.hotel restaurants and bar are overly priced.[SEP]gift shop prices are totally off the scale.[SEP]the 24 hr concierge office closes whenever it feels like.[SEP]nothing is included during your stay at this hotel.[SEP]if you have your own transportation and money is no object, enjoy, other than that i do not recommend this hotel.
0	i stayed there for business for 7 nights.[SEP]i booked for a deluxe room and they kindly upgraded my room to the admiral room.[SEP]the rooms are clean but the decor of the room and bathroom was not that good.[SEP]the view was not good too.[SEP]most of the staff were friendly.[SEP]the swimming pool was under maintenance (roof top).[SEP]the location is in a relatively quiet place.[SEP]the major problem was finding taxis especially from 5 to 8 pm.[SEP]which was really annoying.[SEP]bur dubai is in the middle between deirah and other parts of dubai.[SEP]compared to the high rate (~1700 dh), i think one can find much better hotel but the business event i attended took place in this hotel and the transportation in dubai is clearly a problem, i had to stay there.[SEP]so if you have a car and got a better rate than i had, then it'll be ok to stay in this hotel.[SEP]otherwise, better spend money on other much better hotels.
0	my husband and i recently stayed for three nights at the hotel, and had a very nice time.[SEP]the hotel staff was very pleasant and accommodating and i enjoyed my interactions with them.[SEP]the historic building is beautiful, the decorations tasteful, the room was roomy and enjoyable.[SEP]one of the best features was the free breakfast buffet that had on it anything that you could possibly want (meat, eggs, cereal, fruit, bread, etc.) the staff who worked the breakfast were very kind and very thorough.[SEP]the negatives?[SEP]location.[SEP]i know that others claim that this is a good area, and maybe it is, but i found the area to be sketchy and did not feel comfortable walking down to the inner harbor because of the nearby neighborhoods.[SEP]this, of course, is not the hotel's fault and there is plenty of parking garages and public transportation to accommodate for this anyhow.[SEP]another negative- we got stuck in the elevator not one, but two times.[SEP]both times the issue was fixed and we were out of the elevator within 15 - 20 minutes, but still.[SEP]scary.[SEP]lastly, we found a package of condoms behind the nightstand in our room.[SEP]i know this is small, but it made me wonder how clean the room actually is.[SEP]thank god the condoms were in foil, not used.[SEP]regardless, i want to reiterate how kind the staff was, and how beautiful the building was.[SEP]i would recommend this place to friends- for the price, you can not go wrong.
0	stayed 2 nights at mandalay bay (mb) in dec.[SEP]quality of room and furnishings is 4 stars (out of 5).[SEP]big ~50 " flat screen tv mounted on wall.[SEP]right size hotel for us.[SEP]we stayed 2 nights at mgm grand after mb and mb is nicer.[SEP]parking is not too far of a walk.[SEP]a few minor negatives are location (mb is at the south end of the strip) and no place to sit in the lobby.[SEP]the bed is extremely soft, if you like sleeping on a very soft bed.[SEP]front desk was fairly indifferent during check - in.
0	i stayed here for one night as i arrived in ny quite late on my own (but had a more centrally located hotel for the rest of the weekend booked).[SEP]from the website the photos looked great and i expected a large hotel like reception.[SEP]the entrance was on the side road and the adjacent windows to the front of the hotel looked like they were under renovations but had stopped.[SEP]in fact from the entrance i thought i was entering a small motel.[SEP]there was nothing in reception, no bar, no option to order room service late at night - i was offered a vending machine by the charmless receptionist.[SEP]there was no bar and no breakfast so basically it was just a hotel with rooms![SEP]must admit the room (queen size) was spotless although absolutely tiny - fine for me on my own but wouldn't recommend for two.[SEP]the decor in the room was lovely, comfortable bed, large tv and very very quite.[SEP]location was very quiet.[SEP]i expected chelsea to be a more happening area - i might not have done my homework well but it seemed to be just a nice residential area rather than somewhere to base yourself for shopping.[SEP]there are plenty of other hotels that offer more and are more centrally located.
0	this hilton is very nice and the staff tried to be very accommodating.[SEP]the king room in which we stayed the mlk weekend was nice with a small sitting area off to one side.[SEP]the room looks typical of some of the older manhattan hotels.[SEP]the three windows on different sides was excellent.[SEP]we had a problem with the room safe which maintenance tried to fix but could not.[SEP]we were offered another room but with a queen - size bed.[SEP]we elected to stay in the room.[SEP]our only issue with room was the chilly bathroom.[SEP]it was ok when taking a shower or bath, but during the night, it was too cold.[SEP]the bar was good with a number of other people in our age group (50s).[SEP]we had breakfast in the restaurant, which was good but not exceptional.[SEP]we have stayed in five hilton properties in manhattan over the last few years and while this hotel in very nice it is not favorite.[SEP]the rooms pale compared to the new york hilton, where we usually stay.[SEP]our biggest issue with manhattan east is the location.[SEP]the area, known as tutor city, is too residential for us.[SEP]the one nice thing about the location is its proximity to grand central terminal.[SEP]if you are looking for a reasonably priced hotel in a quiet part of manhattan, this would be a great choice.
0	the alex is in a great location but i would say that the hotel wants to be a 5 star and charge like one but operates more like a 3 star.[SEP]i had a suite room with a kitchenette.[SEP]one problem, no coffee maker in the suite.[SEP]they want you to have to call room service every day and pay $12 to get coffee and wait for it.[SEP]first time in any hotel except vegas with this issue.[SEP]i asked the staff at the front desk and they said they would send one up but never did.[SEP]later i found out that they never intended to and do not have any.[SEP]this is inexcusable.[SEP]the rooms are nice and the hotel is clean, food is good also.[SEP]but i agree with the previous review that the staff is only so, so and the elevator situation is not great.[SEP]this hotel is ok but overpriced for what you get.[SEP]things like free internet and coffee in a suite are expected.
0	my family and i went to l.a. for vacation and decided to stay in hollywood to avoid the crowded downtown.[SEP]although the location of the hotel is quite convenient (close to hollywood commercial area and subway) the surroundings are not nice at all, the area was dirty, crowded and dangerous.[SEP]the hotel staff was not friendly at all, they do not seem to enjoy their work.[SEP]the rooms had a bad smell that we had to run the fan all day - long.[SEP]as soon as i came to the bathroom the first thing i found was a cockroach, disgusting.[SEP]i was not sure what kind of guests the hotel allowed but they seem to be very noisy and throw parties in their room, not to mention that one of the room has a private jacuzzi, who knows what is for.[SEP]the swimming pool, i did not even try to use it, dirty and small.[SEP]the breakfast was tasteless coffee, artificial orange juice and some cakes.[SEP]don't lost your money staying in this hotel, and try not to stay in the area, i saw other hotels even worse than this within a few blocks.
0	this is not a 3 star hotel![SEP]i've stayed at many 3 star hotels in nyc and trust me, this is not worth the money you will spend.[SEP]what's even worse is i booked my room on priceline (i will never again use this service), so had no way to get out of the reservation once we arrived.[SEP]the location is dirty, right off canal street but the good thing was it was close to broadway shopping and little italy dining.[SEP]if you do find yourself needing to book a room here, ladies, do yourself a favor and pack your own shampoo and conditioner.[SEP]this is the only 3 star hotel in nyc that offers 2 in 1 shampoo / conditioner, go figure![SEP]i've also never known an upscale hotel to have slamming mechanisms on the doors.[SEP]our stay saturday night (the night before we had to be at work for a trade show) we were constantly slam awakened by people slam moving from room to room slam after a night out on the town slam.[SEP]bring earplugs!
0	cleanliness of rooms leaves a lot to be desired (bathroom dirty and room dusty on arrival).[SEP]some staff were unhelpful, to the point of being rude (there were also a couple of lovely staff that were very helpful).[SEP]requests for top ups of essential items such as toilet paper were forgotten (until we reminded them for the 3rd time).[SEP]outside telephone line didn't work one night - the staff member on reception that particular night said she would find out what was happening about fixing it and never called us back to help manually patch through an outside line (a couple of nights later we tried again and the same girl on reception that checked us in was able to help - she was one of the nice staff members that knew what she was doing!).[SEP]the location of the accommodation is a fair way off the beaten track and not really in the best part of town.[SEP]wi - fi didn't work above the 3rd floor.[SEP]walls are paper thin, so if you have noisy neghbours, you are out of luck, rooms are tiny (what do you expect in nyc)....... and the list goes on![SEP]my friend and her husband also stayed at the hotel at the same time we did and their experience was much the same.[SEP]spending my 30th birthday in new york was fantastic and i would go back in a heartbeat - i just won't be staying at the gem hotel - midtown west.
0	we stayed at this hotel during our stay to boston, august 15 - 17th.[SEP]booked on priceline through a package -- next time we know better -- staying in town makes a huge difference... shuttle service only goes until 9:00 p.m. and then you will be taking the taxi service home.[SEP]if that is great with you, no problem.[SEP]we attended the baseball game at fenway -- great time... even if you don't go to the game, go for the experience.[SEP]we loved everyone at the hotel, they made our stay enjoyable.[SEP]since it is off the beaten path, we paid $37.00 for two to eat breakfast... ouch![SEP]at harvard square you can find coffee houses, breakfast nooks, etc.[SEP]very good food if you don't mind the walk and crossing a very busy intersection.[SEP]we didn't take the shuttle into harvard square.[SEP]we stayed for three days and loved the hotel, the beds are great -- you can really enjoy your nights sleep![SEP]neutrogena hair and body products, coffee pot in room, and yummy cookies upon arrival.[SEP]overall we loved the hotel and hated the location.
0	i stayed here for a business trip since i like to take care of my own meals when i travel and hate living out of standard hotel rooms.[SEP]the staff was very friendly on arrival (less so on departure - but its was 5 am when i left).[SEP]my unit (an apartment with two bedrooms, a living room and kitchen / dining area) was clean and well appointed.[SEP]my stay was, overall, pleasant.[SEP]i didn't get to use any of the other facilities of the resort so i have no comment on them.[SEP]some issues, however - first, the place is very brightly lit at night and the street lights shine in through the venetian blinds - it was impossible to completely block out the lights ; second - they don't provide dish soap and only one pack of detergent for the dishwasher and no laundry soap (other resort accomodations i've used in orlando supplied all of these in ample quantities) ; the pots were a bit worn out in my unit with badly scoured anti - stick coating.[SEP]the location is decent - quiet and safe for sure, but not as convenient to a decent grocery and the disney facilities as other similar places nearer to the parks.
0	as a starwood preferred guest, i've stayed at many westins.[SEP]this one was merely adequate.[SEP]as others have noted, the location is really poor -- completely out of the way, although you can walk to the north end in about 25 minutes.[SEP]the room had a good view -- floor - to - ceiling windows and the heavenly bed, which was good.[SEP]but otherwise, just a standard room, although clean.[SEP]the lobby was cavernous and lacking any charm and there was always a long line for the desks.[SEP]they don't appear to have enough staff.[SEP]valet parking was over $40![SEP]we never ate at the hotel, but did enjoy having the starbucks in the lobby.[SEP]the gym and pool were nice.[SEP]all in all, it was fine, but i wouldn't choose to stay there again, given all the great hotels in boston more centrally located and it certainly wasn't inexpensive.
0	stayed there 3 nights in mid september.[SEP]it's a nice hotel.[SEP]great service and good breakfast buffet.[SEP]the room was clean and spacious with a nice patio.[SEP]only a 2 of minute walk from the bus stop.[SEP]it's a 30 minute ride to the train station.[SEP]the wait for the bus each day was at least half hour and on sunday over one hour (even though the bus schedule posted said every 10 minutes).[SEP]to much time was wasted waiting for a bus![SEP]i would definitely seek a closer location to city center next time in rome.
0	it's no palace![SEP]service?[SEP]none![SEP]character - well i felt like i was at boarding school.[SEP]the room was so small i couldn't fully open the bathroom door as it hit my bed.[SEP]the only good thing about the location was that it was near the train station, which had very interesting characters drinking, smoking and begging![SEP]would i stay again?[SEP]not a chance.
0	this is my first ever review on a hotel and it is a honest and accurate one.[SEP]i feel the need to inform other people / travellers / tourists so they don't make the same mistake me and my fiancée made when booking this hotel (the bentley nyc).[SEP]right were to start, firstly this hotel is not in a good location if you don't mind walking a lot or getting taxis or using the subway then its fine.[SEP]the hotel comes across as classy and stylish but its the complete opposite its small, shabby, dated and very morbid.[SEP]the views are exaggerated and played on to attract custom.[SEP]the rooms are so tiny and the interior is scruffy, the bathroom is disgusting and the shower is from 1950's the bed is also very small.[SEP]i believed the hype and reviews and was badly let down so don't make the mistake we did.
0	stayed 4 days in this hotel during business trip.[SEP]was chosen because of located not far from office buildings.[SEP]small rooms, location in the middle of nowhere, every evening had to spend 30 euro for taxi from city center.[SEP]the most awful - in this hotel lots of groups normally stay for 1 night within bus country trip.[SEP]every evening - 5 - 6 buses![SEP]real mess![SEP]it means that they leave hotel early morning, and you are waked up by terrible slams the doors loud noice![SEP]it was really terrible!
0	i found the ocean front hotel and restaurant online and read the reviews and thought it sounded like a decent place to stay at for a short vacation.[SEP]first of all, the place is a dump.[SEP]it is next to a some spooky house that looks like it burned down years ago, but was never taken down.[SEP]the beach is not for swimming.[SEP]it is only a surfers beach, so i had to travel to the other side to go swimming.[SEP]the rooms are not clean.[SEP]it was apparent they never changed the sheets.[SEP]i found human hair on the sheets, piillows and on the floor.[SEP]the rooms were damp and smelly.[SEP]the restaurant worker told me that there were no ice machines in the hotel and that i could walk down the road to the store to get some ice, but there were no ice buckets in the room.[SEP]the bar which is next to the hotel is not owned by the hotel, but it is local and the customers are very local.[SEP]not a safe place for a group of girls to hang out.[SEP]my overall experience was terrible.[SEP]i did not feel safe at this hotel and the overall location of the hotel was not easy to locate.[SEP]trust me, don't waste your money, the place is a dump.
0	marriott rive gauche is a business conference hotel, so if you're looking for a charming experience in paris, this is not really what the hotel provides.[SEP]it caters more to large tour groups or businesspeople.[SEP]however, it does have some things going for it: clean and recently renovated, the famous marriott beds, lovely view of the butte montmartre and sacre coeur, and a good breakfast spread.[SEP]what i didn't like was that the rooms were extremely small, the location in the 14th arrondissement is quite remote, the soulless feeling of a conference hotel, and the tiny, windowless gym.[SEP]also, the staff weren't terribly well - trained: long waits at breakfast for coffee ; they kept removing the extra bathrobe which we'd requested because there were 2 guests in the room ; bottled sparkling water arrived without a bottle - opener.[SEP]if you are using your marriott points to redeem a holiday, as i was doing and as it seems most tourist guests to this hotel do, i would consider the renaissance vendome instead, which is a far better hotel in terms of quality and location, and only one category (category 7) more expensive.
0	all depends what you want from a hotel.[SEP]this was my fifth time in vegas, but my first staying off of the strip.[SEP]i chose this hotel because of all the great reviews on here.[SEP]the hotel was excellent value for money and exceptionally clean.[SEP]the pool was lovely with sunloungers always available.[SEP]i found the food to be only average, but good value.[SEP]i was apprehensive about staying off of the strip, but read about the free strip shuttle so decided to give it a go.[SEP]this is where it gets a bit negative![SEP]i don't drive, but am quite happy to walk quite long distances.[SEP]this wasn't possible to the strip from this hotel.[SEP]the distance wasn't the problem, there was no where to walk, quite often the case for the pedestrian in some parts of vegas.[SEP]the strip shuttle was reliable, but returning late at night became a bit of a free for all, with no real queing system.[SEP]therefore people tended to just push in.[SEP]it's seating only, and as you can imagine this sometimes meant people not being able to get on.[SEP]on the whole i missed being on the strip.[SEP]i would recommend this hotel to anyone who drives or isn't worried about the location, because the value for money is fantastic
0	my husband and i picked thehotel at mandalay for our anniversary getaway because it appeared to have an upscale, exclusive feel.[SEP]based on our own experiences and the experiences of close friends and family, it was a considerable leap of faith to stay anywhere but the bellagio.[SEP]however, the mandalay bay website was geared toward good service, adult relaxation, and entertainment.[SEP]when we arrived, it was clear we could not have been more wrong.[SEP]the service was slow, unapologetic, inconvenient, and borderline rude.[SEP]everything that was negative (no, your room isn't ready, no we don't have that available even though you booked it, no we can't help you store your bags) was said with a condescending and dismissive smile.[SEP]the restaurants were average and incredibly expensive, even for vegas.[SEP]the highly acclaimed pools were swarmed with children and unattentive parents.[SEP]the one adult pool cost us $50 for the day.[SEP]no employee seemed to be supervised or held to any sort of code of exceptional service ; in fact, many were uniformed, ignorant, and rude.[SEP]no employee went out of their way to help us or answer questions.[SEP]our room was just okay for the money we paid, had a terrible view, and was only cleaned after calling housekeeping ourselves.[SEP]worst is the location.[SEP]it is far from anything else you'd want to see on the strip, and navigating your way to the sites is difficult and cumbersome.
0	we recently stayed at gn for a suprise birthday party for a wonderful lady.[SEP]we usually stay at flamingo (location, location, location) and always get great comps.[SEP]five nights / six days (basic north tower) of constant gaming, food, and drink... average bets just under $50 for many hours x many days= free room no food ($400), drinks ($200 pool), etc.[SEP]even after losing a considerable amount of money and " asking for an appeal " from the rewards agent... no food.[SEP]i expected to pay for the drinks... not the food.[SEP]ugh![SEP]harrah's has always treated me well, i tried to move anyway, now i'm going back to flamingo.[SEP]reasonable room and food comps has earned flamingo my business (and potentially thousands).[SEP]rooms were ok.[SEP]pool was beautiful while small and crowded.[SEP]freemont street - ok -once.[SEP]front desk - short staffed.[SEP]housekeeping - good.[SEP]comps - poor.[SEP]bar - hope you like " well drinks "'cause top shelf is extra (not even the basic top shelf).[SEP]we travel to vegas 3 - 5 times a year... i guess that we are " strip people " afterall.
0	we used hotwire to get this hotel in napa.[SEP]i wouldn't highly recommend this hotel.[SEP]the rooms are a little dingy and relatively clean.[SEP]the towels had some stains and i thought they could have been a bit cleaner.[SEP]the breakfast " nook " is a joke - some vending food type pastries, coffee and water cooler is all you will find in this tiny corner near the check in desk.[SEP]the biggest issue i had with the place was the location.[SEP]it's right on the silverado trail, but wasn't super close to anything in downtown napa despite saying that it is within walking distance to copia and other locations.[SEP]there are no sidewalks on the street to town, which made walking to dinner seem like a bad idea.[SEP]honestly, stay in the travel lodge.[SEP]it's closer to everything and should be about the same price.
0	i was shocked at how big my room was and at such a great price![SEP]i've been coming to nyc for a yearly shopping trip since 2000 and a friend recommended hotel alexander to me based on the location.[SEP]this was by far the my best stay for my money in the past 9 years![SEP]the staff was very friendly and accommodating from housekeeping to concierge![SEP]i needed help with directions and the staff was extremely helpful and patient with me![SEP]i will definitely be back!!!
0	when you entering this hotel the smell of the nasty food cooking is kicking in your face.[SEP]when you entering your room the huge army of cockroaches are welcoming you.[SEP]when you entering the bathroom there is no words to explain how nasty view you can see.[SEP]you don't even want to use the toilet.[SEP]i rather sleep in the airport instead of staying in this hotel.[SEP]i have no positive things to say about this place.[SEP]it is not cleaned period, bugs bugs and bugs, horrible location, whole property smells like indian food, no service, no regular hot water, rock hard beds, no normal a / c and finally very ugly front desk clerk.
0	the room is huge, i was travelling alone and had two king size beds all for myself![SEP]very comfy beds by the way.[SEP]the only downside is its location... right at the end of the strip (vegas main street), which means, far from the main touristic spots... the surrounding is a bit dead, not much going on.[SEP]there's no free internet either, and a small fridge would definitely come in handy too.[SEP]but the view from the top is nice and it's cheap...
0	we stayed for 2 nights post cruise and would not recommend this hotel for couples, more for families as it was over run with children and very noisey.[SEP]we had requested an early check in as we were disembarking a cruise ship at 9:30, when we arrived at the hotel the room was not ready however we only waited about an hour to check in, we were offered breakfast as we had an early departure on day 2 and would have missed breakfast that morning..[SEP]although classed as 5 star in my opinion this was more 4 star, we have stayed in far superior 5 star hotels in dubai.[SEP]the room we booked was a basic tower room which was adequate for the nights we stayed it did have sea views however if staying longer than 2 nights would probably recommend a balcony room..[SEP]the room was clean but did smell of food and it looked a bit dated, nice bathroom with the usual little extras,,first impression of the hotel was not good either as a lot of building work was going on around the hotel, there was a lot of noise and we didn't like the location..[SEP]until you try a hotel you don't know what it will be like and you learn from mistakes.[SEP]we would not choose to book this hotel again..
0	worst hotel the room was basic with old tv which was not working but did get fixed once i complained.[SEP]the bathroom is tiny, the location very out of the way, the breakfast not at all good   an acquiantance dropped a parcel at reception for me   i never received it, even after enquiring before checkout   after.[SEP]the staff were totally disinterested in helping re my lost parcel.[SEP]sydney has heaps of other great hotels   from the waterfront it is easy enough to get transport to the business districts out of the city if necessary.[SEP]avoid this one!
0	1.[SEP]they have a hidden " resort fee " for $14.99 a day.[SEP]2.[SEP]they closed the pool down.....[SEP]and then we got kicked out of the hot tub one day.[SEP]they didn't have any lawn chairs out.[SEP]so much for going somewhere to enjoy the sunshine.[SEP]3.[SEP]the location is noisy.[SEP]close to the hospitals so you hear the sirens and ambulances all night long.[SEP]i will not be staying here again and would not recommend it.
0	the first room attributed to me (302) looked nice but i rapidly experienced power failures which cancelled the a / c system.[SEP]i was changed to room 502 after being told it was a problem on the 3rd floor.[SEP]the a / c unit was so weak in room 502 that i was again changed to room 819.[SEP]i can not say that the desk personnel was very nice during the whole negociation.[SEP]two power failures interrupted the a / c in that room during the night.[SEP]when electricity came back, lights went on, waking me up!!!!.[SEP]the hot weather had the room temperature climb above 27 ° c as the power failure had switched off the a / c.[SEP]the next day, i asked to meet the manager on duty.[SEP]he had no solution or no commercial offer to compensate for the trouble.[SEP]he indeed insisted the problems were under control......[SEP]the location of the hotel is in a lousy neighbourhood.[SEP]there are so many other choices, pass this one!
0	we stayed in the president for the week end.[SEP]the location is very good.[SEP]near to all sites in london and a quiet and calm area.[SEP]hotel price is high for what you get.[SEP]compared to other european destination its max, a 2 star hotel.[SEP]rooms are clean and o.k. continental breakfast is very, very simple.[SEP]so we did'nt go on the 2nd day.[SEP]the rooms are sticky and noisy, lots of trucks coming in the early morning and collect rubbish and... would not recommend this hotel but i think it could be even worse in london.
0	our first time in europe and we decided to go cheap on hotels since we figured we would be out for the most of the day.[SEP]the service was pretty standard, they spoke english.[SEP]the room was very small, just right for sleeping.[SEP]the bathroom was small, just right for taking a shower.[SEP]the elevator was very helpful.[SEP]the neighborhood is not great because it is near the termini (terminal), it is very busy almost like a market place so it can get very loud.[SEP]there is a nice family - owned restaurant next door / near by that had a good menu and we ate there twice.[SEP]there is also an internet cafe across the street.[SEP]the best thing i liked about the hotel was the price and the least thing i liked about the hotel was the location.[SEP]i was satisfied with the hotel but i do regret staying here because it was our honeymoon.[SEP]i would not recommend this hotel for people who are on their honeymoons, i would suggest spending extra money and stay at a nicer hotel where you can feel relaxed and secure.
0	spent 3 nights in the secret garden.[SEP]after some problems tracking down the owner, eventually got checked in to a clean and spacious ensuite room with ceiling fan (very necessary as it was sweltering!).[SEP]unfortunately, despite having booked ensuite accomodation for the whole stay were told that room had been given to someone else for the subsequent two nights so had to move into another not so nice room with access to a seperate bathroom down the hallway, for the same price.[SEP]roof terrace garden was quite nice.[SEP]breakfast nothing special.[SEP]location not great.
0	pros: plenty of food choices (food all over, 24/7) plenty of parking (three parking garages) affordable rates ($60 on weekend) walmart across the street.[SEP]good for those last minute items.[SEP]very quiet location and hotel.[SEP]cons: pillows were rocks.[SEP]i'm not just saying they were hard.[SEP]they were rocks.[SEP]bed was hard.[SEP]not as bad as the pillows but still very hard.[SEP]like wood.[SEP]pool was dirty.[SEP]lots of bottle caps and litter around.[SEP]hot tub was foamy.[SEP]definitely not good![SEP]getting to room was difficult.[SEP]have to go all the way through the casino if you park at one garage.[SEP]definitely park at garage 2.[SEP]all - in - all, i'd probably not stay again just because of the bedding.[SEP]sleep is important and we all slept like crap because of the bedding.
0	one of the worst hotels i've ever been in.[SEP]so loud and noisy and filthy.[SEP]you can hear your neighbors shutting doors and talking and also doing all their bathroom business through the air vent in the bathroom.[SEP]housekeeping is atrocious.[SEP]i asked to move rooms after finding fecal matter and cigarette butts all over my original room.[SEP]my new room has a tub backflows dirty disgusting water from other people's bathrooms every morning.[SEP]this backflow leaves a black filmy residue with hair in it all over the tub.[SEP]the noise outside the hotel room is constant and lasts all night long with industrial noise.[SEP]the free breakfast is a joke.[SEP]stale pastries and staff that practically accost you for a tip.[SEP]the front desk staff are rude and act like they are inconvienced with any question.[SEP]the hotel rooms are large and the location is central to many attractions but it is not worth the outrageous price they charge for this 2 star dump.
0	location central but not really nice neighbourhood = highway and run down sex shops and alike... so if you re not really into the oldfashioned sneaking gay life or the hardcore scene, there are other more romantic places to stay in berlin, even if you belong to this hotel's target group.[SEP]the hotel has high ambitions, but its hard to reach the level of the sister hotel in barcelona.[SEP]breakfast is not same quality, and the facilities are generally at lower class.[SEP]the all blacjk interior fades fast, and the rooms are stylish but very un - practical even for a short stay.[SEP]three hangers and one bathrobe for two persons... water from the shower all over the bathroom floor and so on.[SEP]the designer did not have much experience with hotels..[SEP]even the hardware shortcomings, the staff is nice..
0	the rooms are of the size of a bathroom in other cities.[SEP]versace tiles, bang & olufsen, etc materials doesn't matter if the room size is super small.[SEP]location, is too far away from many attractions.[SEP]advise to seriously evaluate other hotels.[SEP]it is expensive too.[SEP]i paid euro200 that too without breakfast.[SEP]must say that staff is good.
0	really really wanted to like this hotel, but i really, really didn't.[SEP]when we arrived, all the lights were off and we couldn't get in.[SEP]finally after a text message we were let in, no polite talk of, " how's your flight ", instead, " here's your keys a turn the lights off when you leave the room ".[SEP]this was my first problem with the hotel.[SEP]i thought this was about an experience of staying somewhere arty, but it was the most depressing hotel i have ever stayed in.[SEP]the fact that the hallway lights only come on for about 20 seconds only added to the horrible lonely atmosphere.[SEP]location wise it isn't great, but that was my fault for not checking out berlin first.[SEP]we stayed in the granny room which was not very nice.[SEP]it felt dirty and was.[SEP]after this we stayed in the flying room, which was dark and finally the space room which was even darker and just as dirty.[SEP]i managed to pick up bites on my legs and two on my face.[SEP]i would go as far as saying i hated this hotel and it is definitely the worst place i ever stayed(and it's not cheap)
0	stayed 3 nights in april 2007.[SEP]check in was easy.[SEP]room was a bit tired but ok for the price.[SEP]location not the best unless you have a car although the free shuttles to zoo and seaworld were great.[SEP]had a problem with toilet blocking on last day.[SEP]ok stay for the price but would proberbly stay elsewere if i returned to san diego.
0	i am not a world traveler, but this hotel was not " grand " in my estimation.[SEP]average, yes.[SEP]location leaves a great deal to be desired compared to others i saw while touring rome.[SEP]location might be close to vatican, but sure isn't close to anything else.[SEP]would definitely look further if i planned return trip.[SEP]service in dining room was not grand by any means -- very slow.[SEP]nice rooftop area.
0	i was disappointed.[SEP]i read all the great reviews here and that's why i chose it.[SEP]it was ok, but i thought the downside's outweighed the positives.[SEP]the location is good in the sense that you can walk to a lot of restaurants for dinner and even a movie theatre.[SEP]it's one block from a trolly stop and a short taxi ride to many attractions.[SEP]the neighborhood is on the edge.[SEP]homeless people on the street and a shop that sold undergarmets for the adventuresome.[SEP]doesn't bother me much, but i was with my daugher, so i don't recommend staying here with kids.[SEP]the room didn't have a mini bar and the some of the moulding in the bathroom was rusty.[SEP]also terrible bed.[SEP]i woke i with a back ache each morning.[SEP]the food was really bad.[SEP]even the breakfast... which is usually hard to screw up.[SEP]the staff was very nice.[SEP]my key card didn't work when i arrived and someone from engineering came up and fixed it right away.[SEP]i paid $149 a night.[SEP]front desk people were very nice.
0	broken toilet, tv, electrical outlets.[SEP]filthy, moldy tub / shower.[SEP]dry - rotted drapes, terrible service.[SEP]the " promise " from wyndham that they display in their rooms is a joke![SEP]elevators were gross, even had a smashed banana in the door all day.[SEP]carpet stained all over, and the corners had a thick layer of dust built up in them.[SEP]understanding that renovation is costly, there is still no excuse for filth!!![SEP]i would not even recommend this place for my dogs.[SEP]don't waste your money.[SEP]the only upside was the location & a wonderful cafe / bakery across the street - the europan café.
0	i stayed at the media rotana for 8 nights and it was one of the worst hotel experiences i ever had (and i travel a lot).[SEP]the hotel itself is fine, but the service was horrible and the location leaves much to be desired.[SEP]previously arranged and written agreements were completely ignored and disregarded by the hotel.[SEP]every time i had a question or needed to make arrangements, the response from the hotel was' we will get back to you'.[SEP]however, during the 8 nights i was there, not once did they ever get back to me.[SEP]every time i asked for a taxi, i had justify why i did not want the hotel car service instead.[SEP]it's fine they ask, but not accepting a no, is completely unacceptable.[SEP]i could go on... for 8 days lots of things went wrong every single day.[SEP]all things that on it's own could be ignored, but when it is all day, every day for 8 days, it's not ok anymore.[SEP]i would never recommend this hotel to anyone and will never stay there again.
0	nice hotel, shame about the locale i stayed here for a week and on my own.[SEP]the hotel is perfectly serviceable and very convenient for public transport.[SEP]the room was very clean and everything worked.[SEP]the bath was a bit slippy as i found out the first night when i tried to take a shower   fell but the staff were very helpful when i requested a rubber bath mat (despite a slight communication problem).[SEP]the staff in general were extremely helpful and friendly and the cafe downstairs had great food.[SEP]i don't remember having any kind of noise problem.[SEP]the only downside is its location.[SEP]the area around it was a bit grubby and full of homeless people / beggars etc.[SEP]as a lone female traveller i didn't feel very safe stepping out of the hotel into the immediate surroundings.[SEP]in all, its great value for money and great if you're on a budget like i was.[SEP]especially if there are a couple of you or if you're in a group.[SEP]probably not best for women on their own though.
0	stayed here for a night prior to a job interview in san diego.[SEP]i have to admit i had my doubts after reading reviews that commented on the not so desirable location.[SEP]the hotel entrance was narrow and hard to get to.[SEP]but true to what other ta reviews said, the hotel itself is far from a disappointment.[SEP]the hotel staff were really friendly and checking in was a breeze.[SEP]the hotel's proximity to mission bay was a huge plus.[SEP]did not have any issues with parking, i thought parking spaces were ample (there was a multi level parking lot attached to the hotel).[SEP]the room itself was clean and looked newly remodeled.[SEP]beds were really comfortable and the two sets of pillows (firm and soft) were a nice touch.[SEP]the bathrooms though i can foresee could develop molding if we stayed there for several days because it didn't have an exhaust fan so moisture tends to accumulate.[SEP]but becuase we only stayed 1 night, it wasn't a problem.[SEP]the continental breakfast was more like a full breakfast, with loaves of bread, pastries, rolls, sausages and omelets, a juice and coffee station.[SEP]it was a great value, a steal for the price we paid for a night's stay ($62 inclusive of taxes at hotwire.com).[SEP]the verdict: would stay again if i needed to be in the mission bay area.[SEP]but then again there are so many other choices closer to the downtown area.[SEP]but definitely loved their beds and their breakfasts.[SEP]those were the highlights of my stay.
0	i made the mistake of not checking reviews before booking thru gate 1 and was terribly disappointed with this hotel.[SEP]location - not near anything and about an 8 minute walk from metro.[SEP]rooms are decorated probably like a hostel..[SEP]or worse.[SEP]walls are paper thin and you hear just about everything.[SEP]cleaning ladies like to start really early and make a rediculous amount of noise..[SEP]in addition they let themselves in freely into the room without much notice and before 9am(there are no " do not disturb"signs to put outside.[SEP]breakfast served was the worst i have ever experienced / tasted(a few sweet croissants and rolls).[SEP]front desk staff was very accommodating and helpful.[SEP]oh and towels were more like dish towels..[SEP]just awful.
0	my fiance and i stayed at this hotel (in a rear - full room) for an overnight layover before heading to another island.[SEP]we got in late after a day of traveling and were very tired, hoping to get some sleep.[SEP]that did not happen!![SEP]there was some club or something right next door blasting music (this was a sunday night, not fri.[SEP]or sat.) until at least 3 am.[SEP]i can't tell you if it went any later b / c i actually managed to fall asleep finally.[SEP]the bed and the whole room were quite small - and the bed was the type that if one person moves the other is disturbed.[SEP]i normally have positive things to say about everywhere i stay b / c i am not very picky... i'm not above a super 8 every now and then... but all i wanted was some good sleep and i did not get it here!!![SEP]the only good thing was the location to popular tourist sites.[SEP]we were able to walk to el morro the next morning before catching our flight.[SEP]i would spend a bit more $$and stay somewhere else if comfort is a priority.[SEP]this place might be okay for partiers who would want to be in on that late night noise:)
0	i travel a lot for business and leisure.[SEP]it's not 4 star property.[SEP]it's new and looks great, but service doesn't match.[SEP]front desk personnel forget to provide you with necessary information.[SEP]room wasn't very clean when we arrived - i found medication on the floor in the room and hair in the bath tab.[SEP]next day we came back to the room to find our towels changed and... that's it.[SEP]bathroom wasn't cleaned at all, soap and shampoo - none replaced.[SEP]i called front desk - it took them around 2 hours to send the maid.[SEP]in terms of location - it's great for sport funs.[SEP]it's 5 blocks to the harbor despite the name... not a lot of dining options around the hotel unless you actually go to the harbor.[SEP]i wouldn't recommend this hotel - uit is priced as 4 start hotel, but the service is not what you expect from 4 start property.
0	it is now operated under the tryp brand of hotels and changed management during my stay.[SEP]i don't know how this will impact what this hotel has going for it - value and quality of staff.[SEP]if you are looking for a clean, reasonable hotel, 15 min walk to the ccib convention center and 10 min to the nearest metro in a neighborhood full of warehouses and apartment complexes, this hotel is perfect for you.[SEP]the rooms are modern and nice and it boils down to are you looking for something more than value at the expense of a poor location.[SEP]no wifi and wired internet was 15eur a day.
0	hotel recommended by im race.[SEP]this years race was 45 in walking distance.[SEP]compared to 2010 the hotel room was much more run - down.[SEP]internet only worked (same like last year) after talking to the it lady for 15 min on the phone.[SEP]internet access code was only valid for 1 component, so no pc and i - phone connection possible.[SEP]breakfast room looked like a renovation would be needed soon.[SEP]staff friendly, taxi more hard to get, plan in waiting time.[SEP]room cleaning until 11pm at the neighbor room.[SEP]good location for fast food across the street in the shopping mall though.[SEP]suspicious massage places next door in the same building.
0	good hotel - and all standards for usual business hotel are complied... good kitchen..[SEP]but the location is just awful.[SEP]between the airport and city center, there is no other transport except the taxi.[SEP]moreover, it's very hard to get there during the rush hours, because the hotel is situated on the major city highway, which can be heavily loaded.[SEP]i can recommend it only for the overnight stay for business travellers who not interested in sightseeing.
0	i was on 3 day break from london to see friends in san francisco.[SEP]this hotel was cheap being booked through kimpton's website, with a discount that you get if you subscribe to their in - touch programme (which is free).[SEP]the cost was only about £ 60 per night and for that then you really don't get the right to complain about much.[SEP]the room was fine although on the small side and a little noisy near the elevator and on a low level (i had requested the opposite but the hotel was full).[SEP]reasonably clean although the bathroom was tiny and i had to angle my legs to sit on the toilet because the bath was too close on one side.[SEP]the air con outlet made a strange rattling noise which was bothersome.[SEP]as a base to go out and party though it's fine, the location is good enough and despite the minor issues this place does represent good value and i would stay here again.
0	just ok - we won't return first of all, the piazza is a mess.[SEP]the church is being renovated and is completely covered up.[SEP]there are scaffolds and cranes throughout the area.[SEP]worse than the construction mess though is that each night the piazza attracts a strange element of people that lay around the grass and drink, smoke, bang on objects to make music?, scream, sing... in the morning, the litter is everywhere.[SEP]one night, a man climbed one of the cranes and screamed for hours, apparently threatening to jump.[SEP]police and fire trucks arrived and eventually the man came down.[SEP]it's a not a high - class crowd.[SEP]it can be a bit uncomfortable coming in late at night and having to pass through the crowd outside the hotel.[SEP]the room itself was ok.[SEP]we were on the 5th floor in a standard room with a double bed.[SEP]the room was clean and had a window looking out onto the piazza (not necessarily a good thing).[SEP]breakfast served each morning was nice.[SEP]don't expect warm or friendly service from reception or concierge.[SEP]they don't seem very animated or interested in providing a high level of service.[SEP]the hotel is located in close proximity to all you'll want to do, but so are dozens of other hotels.[SEP]try the savoy for example.[SEP]beautiful piazza (republica) surrounded by cafes and a superior central location.
0	i go to florida every couple of years for the parks and to shop etc.[SEP]this time we thought we'd try our luck at parc soleil instead of staying at the grand vacations club on international drive (tuscany) - big mistake.[SEP]we had a studio for 3 days then a penthouse 1 bed for 3 days over new years.[SEP]the studio was really noisy, could hear every word from the neighbours, the accommodation, whilst clean was nt anywhere near as spacious as at international drive, fridge even smaller(if that were possible).[SEP]the one bedroom was great, complete contrast (we had a view out the back and it was quiet) the problem for me is the location - yeah its close to disney but not close to anything else and its just does nt have a warm friendly atmosphere to it as tuscany does.[SEP]the food is better, the shop and the restaurant but the pool looks dated, if you have a view over the flat roof and across onto the pool, it looks awful.[SEP]the water slide now looks very dated and overall i think for a property just a few years old it is already starting to look tired.[SEP]the build quality (noise) and the internal fittings are just not u to scratch i think.[SEP]i wo nt be going there again - ever.
0	this was a last minute reservation as we had to stay additional night in barcelona.[SEP]honestly, the location was not the greatest [ please note: please be aware of your surroundings outside of the hotel ] but it is within walking distance of a lot of shopping and underground metro.[SEP]the hotel and rooms are nice and clean.[SEP]staff was great and very helpful and wifi was free.[SEP]the rooms were a little small but it wasn't a big deal to us.[SEP]this hotel listed as a 2 star..[SEP]i think it's underrated.
0	the room was nice but the location wasn't the best.[SEP]it was right next to the freeway so you had the constant noise of traffic since our room was on that side of the building.[SEP]next time we are in seattle we will book something a little closer to all of the sights.[SEP]it was quite a walk to go to the space needle and pike place market (which was down a very steep hill).[SEP]our room was very clean and comfortable.[SEP]parking is pretty expensive so be prepared for that.[SEP]not a lot of restaruants are within walking distance of the hotel which is bad if you do not have a car.
0	my husband and i spent 5 days at the princess as part of a conference group.[SEP]the location is terrible.[SEP]while public transportation is nearby, the hotel is quite a distance from the city center and all the sights.[SEP]each taxi ride into the city cost 11 - 15 euros.[SEP]that very quickly added up to much more than we had anticipated.[SEP]the room was attractjve but small.[SEP]the bed was very comfortable but the bathroom left much to be desired.[SEP]the separate shower was next to the separate toilet and the shower leaked onto the floor into the toilet area.[SEP]not pleasant.[SEP]the view was great.[SEP]the signs in the lobby forbiding guests from bringing in outside drinks or food made it feel like a dorm or a hostel and not a deluxe hotel.[SEP]concierge services were non existent and the front desk staff were not knowledgeable or helpful at all.[SEP]the breakfast buffet was very limited and unexciting.[SEP]so it seems that what this hotel has going for it are low rates and a modern design look.[SEP]i would not stay here again.
0	it was kind of expensive for the quality we got.[SEP]it felt like a mediocre hostel.[SEP]the bed was small.[SEP]the walls were super thin.[SEP]the bathroom was way too small, and not the cleanest.[SEP]the location is close to the metro, but really not the best first impression a person should have of barcelona.[SEP]it's by a live porno show and a billion greasy fast food places... gross.[SEP]the staff was mostly very nice, however don't ask the indian men for information... they don't know any cool spots and routinely gave us bunk info.[SEP]the internet was super expensive.[SEP]9 euros for an hour![SEP]you can get it for 1 euro down the street.[SEP]also, they were stingy with toilet paper![SEP]my boyfriend got snapped at when he asked for more rolls.[SEP]first of all, why should you have to ask every day for more toilet paper?[SEP]the maids hardly ever replaced them.[SEP]the man at the desk literally snapped at him and questioned his toilet paper usage.[SEP]whaaaat?![SEP]overall, i think there are better places you can find in barcelona.
0	i recently stayed at the hotel for business.[SEP]i arrived at 2130hrs to be greeted by a very smiley but extremely useless receptionist.[SEP]having had a long journey i asked what time the restaurant closed and was informed that the hotel didn't have one.[SEP]upon opening the door to my room a nauseating smell of faeces hit me (iâ€ ™ ve worked in hospitals and care homes for over 30 years and know the smell).[SEP]i checked the bathroom but this smelt wonderful... it was coming from the carpets.[SEP]the loo seat fell off at the first touch, the hand basin immediately overflowed when i tried to wash my hands and the nice looking 4-poster bed was as hard as a rock.[SEP]i chose not to have a bath or shower as i have had typhoid before and didnâ€ ™ t want a repeat.[SEP]the hotel is very noisy, not in a good location i.e. 20 walk from the nearest tube station and the food is fair to bad.[SEP]if you value yourself donâ€ ™ t stay here.[SEP]i work for a large national organisation and we have taken this off of our satisfactory list of hotel so i will never be going back there and neither will any of my colleagues.
0	nice hotel but in a poor location.[SEP]we had a room at the back of the hotel so didn't suffer traffic noise.[SEP]room and facilities were excellent although, as others have pointed out, the breakfast room is far too small.[SEP]room was big, well - furnished and the housekeeping was good.[SEP]the front desk staff were mainly very helpful.[SEP]beware the misleading statement on the hotel website about its proximity to the skytrain.[SEP]it is in fact a 15 minutes bus ride away.[SEP]the hotel is well served by vancouver's trolley buses and the front desk will help you with directions, but the skytrain is of no use if you stay here.
0	upon arrival, we were given a smoking room despite the fact that we booked a non - smoking room (we have a child with us).[SEP]the front desk receptionist was nice and gave us non - smoking room after 2 hours of waiting.[SEP]its good that we were allowed to wait inside the hotel room.[SEP]room was small (standard for hk).[SEP]shuttle service is free from hotel to macau ferry station and airport express (ifc mall).[SEP]the location is a bit far from mtr - shuen wan station - hongkong island line.[SEP](mtr is very convenient in going places around hk) from the hotel, we need to ride a tram (hk$2.00) for 5 - 10minutes to reach the mtr.[SEP]outside the hotel, the smell is medicinal considering that the location is known for selling chinese medicines.[SEP]there are 24hours convenient store available and some small restaurants (cheap food from hk$10), there are no fast food like mcdonalds near the hotel.[SEP]however, all in all, we enjoyed our stay.[SEP]but if il go back to hk esp.[SEP]bringing along my child to hk, i might look for other hotel that is located near the mtr.
0	having stayed in several vegas hotels, this is definitely the worst on the strip.[SEP]my room had a pleasant view, but the decoration was even browner and more dated than usual - white louvered doors into the bathroom (which stank like a mens' urinal) were very 70s.[SEP]check in was chaotic and took far too long.[SEP]on the same property are the four seasons and the hotel and, apart form the distance involved in walking from one to another, either of these is far better.[SEP]however for location and character my recomendation would be the venetian and for value treasure island.
0	rooms are big, clean and quite recent refurbished.[SEP]bathrooms are nice and clean.[SEP]cold floors.[SEP]it may be som noice from the hallways and nearest rooms... the personell in the reception needs to take a course in hospitality and service.[SEP]in my case there was a misunderstanding between hotwire and the hotel, so i could not get the complimentary breakfast as promised.[SEP]the hotel did nothing to help me... they where just stubborn and not helpful.[SEP]the hotel itself are quite far for the city senter, so it is not especially good if you are staying out late....... public transport is so and so on the location.[SEP]you have to change from bus to tram before you get to alexander platz.
0	i don't know how this hotel has been highly rated apart from location and the staff there's nothing to the hotel there are no sound proof insulation on walls you can hear every little noise from rooms which was very annoying the windows are stated as double glazing but again the are 2 set of glass on windows it certainly wasn't double glazing you could hear the traffic all day including people speaking outside and all night the cars tooting.[SEP]the breakfast very bland and dry not fit for a hotel rating for 4 and a half i would grade this as a very good 3 star hotel.[SEP]there's no lounge.[SEP]the breakfast bar is very tight and can get crowded.[SEP]we got back yesterday the noise in the hotel put me off no i would not use this hotel again.[SEP]we stayed a week and on many occasions got woken up by noise in the hotel and from the noise outside and we were at the 3rd floor.[SEP]i must give credit to miss seda and mr salih for there hospitality.[SEP]when i told the noise problem to the staff they said it wad the first they had an issue......
0	my best friend and i were on a girls trip to vegas.[SEP]we loved this hotel but the location was not our first choice.[SEP]the staff were nice and the rooftop pool was perfect too.[SEP]if i were travelling for work this hotel would have worked.[SEP]since this was a girls trip we had to get to hotel on the strip.[SEP]if you are looking to relax and not be in the action this hotel will work for you and your family.[SEP]however, if you want to be in the action its kind of a hike to & from the strip.[SEP]no casino on site, this hotel could be anytown usa, but if you want action choose a different hotel.
0	we spent four nights here in the fall, when the weather was about mid-80's every day.[SEP]this property is very new and modern, and the rooms / units are all five - star quality.[SEP]the pool complexes are very nice too - but, they were quite crowded every day.[SEP]the better option is to go across the road to the j.w. marriott, because you get free access there, and they have huge pools and a lazy river and generally much bigger grounds.[SEP]the pool restaurant is suprisingly good.[SEP]at least half the people staying here have kids, so it's family friendly.[SEP]the location is way north in phoenix though, it's literally out in the desert.[SEP]while it's scenic, if you want to go to scottsdale or go tour or golf or whatever somewhere that isn't north, it's going to take a while.[SEP]there are restaurants and stores in the area, as it appears that the city is creeping out that way, but all the shopping centers are new and bland and feel like some kind of exurban photocopy.[SEP]wasn't able to golf so can't comment on the course other than that it looked nice.
0	the rokin hotel has an excellent location near dam square.[SEP]the rooms are a good size and breakfast was included.[SEP]out stay was ok, but we found the front desk staff to be unhelpful.[SEP]our room (10) had a view of a flat roof and when we asked for a better view, he just said we are fully booked in an unhelpful manner.[SEP]addtionally we had mosquito's in our room which bit me and my wife on our first night.[SEP]i've been to amsterdam numerous times in the past, but have never seen mosquito's there!
0	i am italian and i came with my wife and my baby (10 month) by tour.[SEP]it was planned another hotel, but at the end they gave us arabian park.[SEP]location is not very good, but they have free bus to reach the beach, the airport, a nice shopping centre that work perfectly well.[SEP]also a taxi service.[SEP]the room was very clean and silent, just a little bit cold.[SEP]breakfast great and also the restaurant very nice.[SEP]but the best was the personnel: very kind, fast in answering' helpful.[SEP]this hotel was far beyond my best expectation.[SEP]thank you arabian park.
0	my girlfriends and i stayed at the roger williams hotel during the summer of 2007.[SEP]pros: extremely helpful front desk staff, doorman, waitress.[SEP]the decor was nice, hotel was very clean.[SEP]bright room.[SEP]lovely quilt.[SEP]aveda toiletries were a nice touch.[SEP]robes were provided.[SEP]we left our luggage at the hotel after checkout and they tagged our bags, which is comforting, as all the european hotels i've stayed at simply left the bags aside unattended.[SEP]cons: the bathroom allows for little privacy.[SEP]our toiletries were not replenished on the second morning of our stay.[SEP]for the price of the hotel, we expected to have it replenished![SEP]as someone else had mentioned, the numerous price tags in the room contributed to the hotel feeling more like a convenience store than a home away from home.[SEP]the room was small, but it is to be expected for manhattan.[SEP]the buffet breakfast was decent but way overpriced.[SEP]while i have no real complaints, i would probably not go back to this hotel due to the location and lack of value.
0	the worst place i have ever stayed in, in my life.[SEP]i traded christmas week in a luxury time share in san francisco for the roach motel.[SEP]no where to park the car to even unload luggage.[SEP]no staff after 9:00 p.m. the stereo only played tapes.[SEP]really!![SEP]tapes??[SEP]does anyone own a tape.?? the beds were like sleeping on a wooden slab with a grass mat.[SEP]the place smelled badly.[SEP]it was dirty.[SEP]the carpeting must have been the original piece of carpeting invented and " still in place.[SEP]" no shampoo and conditioner.[SEP]to get to your room you had to go by an apartment building that had balconies with people sleeping on them.[SEP]there is a strip club right outside the door with scantily clad girls trying to lure people in.[SEP]not a family friendly location.[SEP]if you want an extra towel, it is $2.50.[SEP]don'tgo there if you expect any kind of amenities.[SEP]if rci sticks you there demand to be moved.[SEP]we arrived on sat.[SEP]afternoon and they moved us on mon.[SEP]morning to a very nice place.[SEP]rci needs to dump this place.[SEP]it is not fair to rci members, we pay a lot of money for these timeshares and they should be more discerning about there accommodatins or represent them as they really are.
0	good price for a 5 star hotel with average service you can see when you arrive at their lobby that its a new hotel with contemporary decoration.[SEP]reception staff does nt smile at all and not friendly.[SEP]tried to call from the room once and a guy answered in sleepy voice.[SEP]they just provide one key in each room.[SEP]we asked for an extra key for our convenience since we had two suites but the reception guy told me that they only provide one and answered me that we will just open the door for you if you need an extra key.?!?[SEP]when we insisted, they said we need to pay 50 dollars in case we lost it.[SEP]for a five star hotel, at least provide two keys and this should not be an issue.[SEP]the room is good, clean with two queen beds.[SEP]big enough compared to other hotels.[SEP]housekeeping staff are nice and they make up the room very well.[SEP]the only problem is that the water drains very slow in the bath tub.[SEP]location wise, its very far from the central major shopping malls.[SEP]there is one small mall- city walk next to the hotel but not all the shops are open.[SEP]the hotel is also near a market and 5 mins walk to west rail (kcr).[SEP]they do provide a shuttle bus on certain times but you have to pay 15 dollars.[SEP]i think they should provide this for free as their location is not too convenient at all.[SEP]we called for the luggage down when we checked out but nobody came to collect our luggage.
0	stayed here during july with family.[SEP]hotel was fine, clean, spacious enough for us but the location is not good or safe.[SEP]you must watch out for pick pocketers (especially on the underground) and all the scammers who are round and about.[SEP]even in the heart of paris they are there.[SEP]experienced in mcdonalds of all places having a ball of fire crackers thrown inside by a group of young black coloured youths.[SEP]security guard wandered in 5 minutes later as if this was an every day occurance.[SEP]also, what appeared, from the amount of fresh blood on the floor, to be a stabbing also took place.[SEP]we were so pleased to get out of paris that we all said (5 of us) we would not come back.
0	the location is ok depending on what you want to do.[SEP]not much going on in the financial district on the weekend, so quiet outside.[SEP]there was a party in the hotel room nearby that was noisy.[SEP]the party woke me up (1 am getting kinda loud), but i think someone came up because the noise was less about 15 minutes later.[SEP]there's a seaport closeby where you can take a water tour of the city and about a 15 minute walk to the harbor to catch a ferry to ellis / statue of liberty.[SEP]subway stops are also close.[SEP]there is some construction going on at the front of the hotel, so the cabbie couldn't find it right away.[SEP]the people were nice and friendly.[SEP]they can't call a cab, but one guy flagged a cab for me (front street has little traffic, so he had to go up a block).[SEP]the bed, as one person mentioned, is a bit hard.[SEP]i'd call the hotel " sparse ".[SEP]the tv worked and it was clean (not overly spotless, but not a dump).[SEP]for the price, it was pretty good.[SEP]hotels around that area are expensive.
0	my young kids loved this resort with its activity slides and boats in the pool areas.[SEP]it felt safe and secure, and had a good activity programme.[SEP]however i felt that it lacked the usual feeling of luxury that i have come to expect from mariotts vacation club.[SEP]the rooms were comfortable and well equipped.[SEP]my main criticism of this resort is its closeness to the i-4 motorway.[SEP]i could here the traffic from my room 24/7 and found it impossible to use the balcony because of the noise.[SEP]i would recommend asking for a room located at the front of the resort, furthest from the i-4.[SEP]the location was good, as disney, universal and seaworld theme parks were all within 10 mins driving distance.[SEP]i would recommend thisresort to those with young children, but think that other could be disappointed.
0	stayed at the days inn montreal while visiting the city to watch a couple of habs games.[SEP]it was our first time in the city so we didn' t know what to expect in terms of getting around the city.[SEP]we knew the hotel was a fair distance from the bell centre / downtown but booked anyway mostly due to price.[SEP]the hotel was clean and staff friendly upon arrival and throughout our stay.[SEP]they assisted us with questions regarding directions and local sights.[SEP]the rooms were average, nothing spectacular but we had stayed in a few days inn's over the years and didn't expect luxury.[SEP]rooms weren't noisy and elevators were good.[SEP]the hotel is located about a 10 minute walk from the metro, which will quickly take you to the bell centre and downtown shopping.[SEP]we found there were also lots of taxi's as well.[SEP]old montreal was about a 15 - 20 minute walk and china town was about 5 minutes.[SEP]lots to see and do in both places.[SEP]biggest drawback is the location, with limited restaurants close by.[SEP]we walked from the metro after games to the hotel and felt safe.[SEP]restaurant in lobby was good and we ordered room service as well which was great.
0	this hotel is in a business district and, in my opinion is unsuitable for tourists.[SEP]it caters for large groups and conferences - so be warned, it could be very busy.[SEP]in my case, the location was convenient.[SEP]my room was spacious but totally devoid of any charm whatsoever.[SEP]the bed was comfortable, but that's about as far as the positives go.[SEP]the decor of the room was bland and the furniture basic but functional.[SEP]the carpet was badly worn, very faded and in dire need of replacement.[SEP]the bathroom was clean but very old fashioned and the shower was distinctly low - pressure.[SEP]overall, the room was thoroughly depressing.[SEP]there was a mini - bar, but no tea / coffee making facilities in the room.[SEP]the doors, walls and windows offer little to no soundproofing.[SEP]i especially enjoyed my neighbour singing a lullaby at about 11 pm one evening, though it didn't help me drift off to sleep.[SEP]less enjoyable was the constant flow of conference - related bus traffic entering / leaving the car park - which seemed to require one or more blasts of their horn, even at night.[SEP]also worthy of note is that you can hear every sound from the neighbouring bathroom.[SEP]another reviewer commented that the hotel feels like a converted hospital - i didn't believe it until i stayed there.[SEP]it really does![SEP]would i stay here again?[SEP]not a chance.
0	the hotel discription of location is very misleading![SEP]we had to take a cab from the train station to the hotel 28euro![SEP]then the statement about shuttle services forgets to spell out restricted times and how much it costs to take the shuttle outside those times![SEP]our room was disgusting![SEP]a hole in the wall, broken toilet seat, torn pillows, the list goes on![SEP]we had to stay one night because they refused to refund our money![SEP]the woman behind the counter kept saying she could not refund us because we did not cancel 2 weeks before check in date.... i told her 2 weeks before check in date i believed their false advertising and didn't find out how horrible the place truly was unitl we got there![SEP]i could not handle a 2nd night in that dump, so we went into venice and stayed at the best western right across the street from the train station![SEP]* * * * the best western hotel bolgna was very accommodating, clean, safe and great breakfast!
0	after spending a busy month in europe we wanted to end our trip somewhere nice and relaxing and this certainly wasn't the case with lotus boutique.[SEP]the location is crap, being located in the old town on the wrong side of the creek, on a major intersection near the airport.[SEP]the road noise, 24 hour building supplies garage door being opened all night and the planes flying overhead kept us awake half the night.[SEP]we didn't have a new room like some of the other reviewers mention.[SEP]the cleanliness was poor, particularly in the bathroom where the tiles clearly hadn't been cleaned and there was hair left around the shower and on the floor.[SEP]the bed linen had holes in it and dirty marks.[SEP]i'm not sure how a 4-star hotel can get away with this.[SEP]we were put in a smoking room and asked many times to be moved but nothing was done.[SEP]the reception staff, whilst smiling and polite were completely incompetent.[SEP]they had no knowledge of the local area and continually gave us wrong information, rather than just saying they didn't know.[SEP]for example, we can confirm that you can get taxis on a friday night and nasser square certainly isn't a shopping destination that anybody would want to be dropped off in.[SEP]the hotel's pool was like swimming in a hot bath on the roof.[SEP]on a positive note, the hotel's restaurants whilst empty most of the time, did have good food.[SEP]if you want a beach holiday in a decent location don't stay at the lotus boutique in deira.
0	bad location, 10 minute walk from nearest subway station.[SEP]paper thin walls.[SEP]i could hear the people talking next door![SEP]rooms were clean.[SEP]much better to stay futher out in a hotel beside a subway.
0	my wife and i spend 5 days holiday in barcelona and we stayed at the hotel europark.[SEP]we traveled to barcelona from madrid via ave train and took a taxi from train station to europark, the taxi fare was less than $15euros.[SEP]during our stay we used 2 hotel services ; laundry and room service.[SEP]laundry cost was fair and quite fast service however the room service food was pretty bad (we're too tired and decided to stay in for the night).[SEP]the hotel does offer iron and iron board upon request.[SEP]the superior room (209) is fairly comfortable, there are several things the hotel should fix and address ; there is a hole on the wall near the bed, the door dead bolt slot is cracked, the shower holder is loose so when you turn it on it spray all over, and the bed cover / blanket should be replace as it looks worn out.[SEP]all issues seems to be some what minor but they are also easy fix to provide the right impression.[SEP]the room does have adjoining room doors which means you can hear next door a bit.[SEP]the hotel location is not bad, 10 minutes taxi ride from train station, about 20 minutes taxi ride to airport, and less than 10 minutes walk to passeig de gracia.[SEP]overall the hotel was fine and we paid about $140 per night.
0	i just got back from my trip where i stayed at the hotel for 4 nights.[SEP]the hotel itself is very modern and the room decor is all very nice and contemporary.[SEP]having said that, only negative thing i can say is that my room was not as clean as i expected it to be.[SEP]when i got to my room there were several white stains next to the bed and more stains in the separate toilet- i was really disappointed.[SEP]apart from that, rooms were comfortable.[SEP]as far as the cafe / restaurant goes, this was all fairly average.[SEP]i thought that prices at the restaurant were on the expensive side.[SEP]the skyy bar on the 10th floor was funky with decent cocktails but fairly quiet.[SEP]in terms of location, the hotel itself is located just outside the city centre which takes 20mins on a tram (no.1/17) to central station (closest tram station is called surinameplein and it's a 10min walk from the hotel).[SEP]i thought the hotel was just a bit far out and i wasn't particularly comfortable walking alone at nights to the hotel as a solo traveller.[SEP]the closest grocery store from the hotel is in lelylaan station which is a good 15 - 20 minute walk.[SEP]overall, my stay at this hotel was a fairly average experience.[SEP]if you like staying at a good value for money hotel but wouldn't mind compromising on the location then this is not a bad place to stay at.[SEP]otherwise, i'd pay a bit more and stay at a hotel that is centrally located.
0	i knew the location was not fantastic but taxis were readily available and cheap and the hotel staff very helpful at booking them.[SEP]the hotel design was great and pretty much what we expected after looking at the website.[SEP]the staff were ok a couple were really nice and helpful and a couple a little offhand.[SEP]we had a problem with our reservation as we had booked 2 interconnecting rooms - we have 2 children and they tried to give us 2 rooms on 2 different floors but actually after standing our ground they eventually gave us a suite instead for the cost of 1 room which was fine.[SEP]i agree about the pool it was so cold it was suprising how they managed to make it that cold, and the drinks service around the pool was shockingly slow and was a bit offhand.[SEP]i read with interest about the 7 pm buffet which nobody at any point told us about - that would have been nice to have been told overall the hotel is fine and we got a very good internet rate of 155 euros per night per room so felt it was good value for that.
0	room is tiny, we missed some space inside of the toilet - tables and inside of the big table too.[SEP]your toilet room with wc was extremely small, we coudn´t turn around.[SEP]there was a reconstruction in the hotel, we were disturbed by a huge noise.[SEP]we had a terrible view from the window (viz.[SEP]enclosed photograph).[SEP]the dinning room and the hotel´s location - very nice.[SEP]general impression: when we compare the other three - star hotels in europe - standard, with three - star hotels in south - east and east asia (singapur, hongkong, bali)- very huge substandard and with three star hotels in africa (egypt, tunisia) - above standard.
0	i stayed at this property while attending a tradeshow at bcec.[SEP]perfect location for this.[SEP]not so great spot if you want to see the main tourist spots of boston.[SEP]nothing was in walking distance in my opinion.[SEP]i ate that the irish restaurant at the hotel a couple nights just for the convenience factor.[SEP]it was fine, but like many hotel restaurants -- over priced.[SEP]* * * watch your credit card statement after your stay * * * * i had a $6 charge for a bottle of water in the room that i did not use.[SEP]some of my co - workers that stayed at the hotel also had a $9 charge separate from their hotel stay charged to their card!![SEP]not cool.
0	we stayed there with our 4 children, ages 10, 13, 15 and 16.[SEP]we had the 2 bedroom with a living room area.[SEP]i think this hotel is best for those with small children.[SEP]the seating in the kitchen " area " was only for four, and the couch / love seat held 2 and there was one chair.[SEP]the hotel is on the train tracks.[SEP]we were in room 201 in the back of the hotel - although the front would be right on a busy street you might be best off asking for a room on that side - because we were kept up all night by the train.[SEP]they give you ear plugs in your room.[SEP]never a good sign.[SEP]the front desk was just " okay " - when i asked if they had local movie listing - they refered me to the computer and it was not " free ".[SEP]most front desks will assist you with this information.[SEP]the location was also just " okay ".[SEP]it is definately not downtown - closer to the airport.[SEP]the breakfasts were good - they were better then most that include breakfast in the rate.
0	this was good value - a family room for â£29 a night.[SEP]the room was spacious (even with 2 camp beds) and clean.[SEP]the nearest rail staion was about a 10 - 15 minute walk, however it was through what looked like a dodgy area - i wouldn't have liked to have walked the kids back past it in darkness.[SEP]on arrival we got to the room to find that there were no children's beds ready & we had to wait for soem to arrive, along with the bedding - not ideal for 2 small sleepy children after a long day![SEP]we were lucky, having a room at the back, but it was very hot and still pretty noisy if you opened the window at night (industry noise).[SEP]breakfast was adequate, but it was the same each morning and the cooked option was warm rather than hot.[SEP]they also ran out of stuff at times (no milk on our first morning & a bit of a delay whilst someone went to buy more).[SEP]we thought there was a problem with the extractor fan in the bathroom, only to be told there wasn't an electrical one, hence all bad smells just stayed in the room and floated out into the bedroom - not ideal when there's a family of 4![SEP]i'd use a travelodge again, but definitely not this one, mainly because of the location![SEP]staff were all polite & pleasant at all times and did attend to problems - but they could not always solve them.
0	i was in s.f. on business for 5 days and loved staying at the orchard.[SEP]every time i returned to the hotel i was greeted and made to feel i had returned home.[SEP]the location is perfect![SEP]i could walk everywhere, or easily get any type of public transportation (the cable car was 20 seconds away).[SEP]i will definitely return!
0	i actually stayed here way back in april but have not had an opportunity to write a review.[SEP]i came here with two girlfriends for a girls' weekend.[SEP]we had the usual planned - shopping, partying and just spending time away from work.[SEP]the hotel itself is very nice and very well kept.[SEP]as others have mentioned it is quite a trek from the hotel to the main strip and we definitely do not recommend this location for those looking to go out to party![SEP]for one - several of the drives coming into the different towers are closed after certain hours.[SEP]no one wants to have to walk very far after a good night out partying![SEP]furthermore, the concierge closes early, i believe it was 8 pm one night - i thought this was vegas![SEP]the room was very clean when we got there, but it seems the cleaning crew after that barely cleaned anything.[SEP]they made the beds, but it does not seem they did anything else.[SEP]nonetheless i will give the signature suites 4 stars, as the property is quite nice, the hotels are well kept (when you first get there) and if you're not there to party - its probably a pretty good stay since it definitely doesn't attract a lot of younger parties and thus there is a lot less noise!:)
0	most travel booking sites rate this hotel as a 4 star hotel, but it's really just a 2 star hotel with valet parking and bellman services.[SEP]the bellman was friendly and that was pretty much the only good thing about this hotel.[SEP]the room we got is one of those which faces a building (closely right in front of the room) and that blocks out most of the view and natural light, so the room felt very small and cramped.[SEP]plus all the furnitures as well as the bathroom are all old and pretty worn - out.[SEP]it just felt like we were in a motel room.[SEP]the location is okay as the hotel is close to a subway station, and there are some restaurants and convenience stores nearby.[SEP]i guess if we had an expectation that this was going to be a 2 star hotel going in, then i might have given it a higher score.
0	the good customer service at the bay tower was fantastic ; we arrived a few hours before scheduled check - in but were allowed to check - in early.[SEP]front desk staff was very nice and accommodating.[SEP]harbor view was beautiful and the room was clean and comfortable with a nautical theme.[SEP]the bathroom was a bit disappointing — it looked tired like a bathroom from a 1980s family home.[SEP]still, it was manageable and everything worked fine.[SEP]the not - so - good only two major complaints about the bay tower: the location and the noise.[SEP]i booked on priceline thinking it would be closer to gaslamp ; * technically * we could have walked there, but it would have been quite a hike.[SEP]since we didn't have a rental car (and didn't want to pay for a taxi), our exploration radius was very limited.[SEP]and since we were in our room much of the time, we noticed that it was quite noisy.[SEP]you could hear every sound from the hallway from quiet conversations to people dragging in from the clubs at 2 - 3am.[SEP]and since we were there over new year's eve, we also heard several boisterous groups until around 4 am.[SEP]unrelated: could not access free wi - fi.[SEP]decent stay overall, but probably would not stay again.
0	this hotel location is a nightmare![SEP]unless you have a driver to pick you up and take you around whilst you stay there is fine.[SEP]but if you need to be close to mtr then avoid this place at all cost![SEP]the taxi ride was $45 hkd from mong kok east station but it ’s a real hassle to get to the station from central.[SEP]at there at 2.40pm after 3 hours trying to locate it, the room was still not ready took them 30mins to check me in.[SEP]right![SEP]internet is $180 hkd per 24 hour that ’s a real rip off even hk central hotels only charge $120 hkd the most.[SEP]the hotel is not like the photos on their website ; it ’s all air brushed and shiny when in reality it ’s a dump and not 4 stars they claim to be.[SEP]i say 3 at the most.[SEP]the room i was checked in had a mouldy smell the furniture and décor looks like its was done back in 1970 and not been up - dated since (that would explain the smell) all in all i would rather pay the extra $200 - 500 hkd to stay in a more modern and new hotel that ’s also centrally located near a mtr.[SEP]so do not book this hotel unless you have too!
0	this is a fairly new resort, part of a timeshare operation.[SEP]as such you can expect newish rooms, nice furnished.[SEP]this property is done in a faux - tucscan style.[SEP]the problems are many but two are the most important to those considering this as a place to stay.[SEP]first, the service (front desk in particular) is disorganized and the teamwork with housekeeping completely absent.[SEP]with an earlier than desired check - out time time (11 am) and later than desired check - in time (4 pm), you'd expect rooms to be ready when you arrive.[SEP]no way and get ready to wait to see the front desk people about this (you'll need to go twice if this happens to you, too).[SEP]second, the location.[SEP]this property is way out of position to the napa valley proper and might only be useful if you plan to spend time in both the napa valley and sonoma valley areas - a half hour minimum to each.[SEP]but you can expect a comfortable room with most of what you need and most everything works that way you need it to.[SEP]with better staffing, training, coordination and execution (too much to ask?) you'll only be a ways away from what you came here for.
0	we had a long journey by car.[SEP]the hotel's location is very bad.[SEP]traveled a great deal in the industry, to find the hotel.[SEP]me happy to find an empty parking lot.[SEP]receptionist greeted us bad.[SEP]room was clean.[SEP]breakfast not bad.
0	the location is good if you like mid - town and the hustle and bustle of times square.[SEP]room size was adequate although there appears to be a peculiar design fault with the bathroom.[SEP]it is surrounded by opaque glass that leaves the person in the bathroom unable to see out, but remain entirely visible to anyone looking in - so if you want privacy from your travelling companion when in the shower or on the toilet, this isn't the place for you.[SEP]another design fault was the lack of storage space - a large closet, but an extremely limited number of drawers (only 1 drawer in fact).[SEP]the bed was very comfortable, and no sign of bed bugs although the mattress could really have done with a vacuum - lots of hair and fluff.[SEP]the carpet was a bit dirty, and was not vacuumed throughout our 5 day stay.[SEP]similarly the duvet cover was not changed (although sheets were changed every other day).[SEP]the gym facilities on the 10th floor were first rate and the concierge was helpful in making restaurant reservations.
0	in january the rates are extremely reasonable for two travellers in a room looking out over the san marco basin.[SEP]the hotel staff are so helpful and the breakfast service is formidable.[SEP]we stayed 5 nights in venice for $600.[SEP]cdn.[SEP]divided between two people, very reasonable for the location and amenities.
0	i stayed at the stanford from febuary 20 - 22.[SEP]i've stayed before for business, because the location is great and the prices are unbeatable.[SEP]however, this time the hotel was unberable.[SEP]the room was extremely hot and dingy.[SEP]the bathroom floor had hairs on it and the tub had a ring of soap scum around it.[SEP]on my second night i encountered a huge roach that crawled right across my bed.[SEP]i called the front desk and they offered to kill the roach.[SEP]after a few minutes of arguing they gave me another room that was so noisy and unkept i didn't sleep the entire night.[SEP]i will never stay here again and i would advise spending a little more for a guarenteed clean and bug free room.
0	i read the reviews on this site and so it was with some trepidation that i went to this hotel.[SEP]i was glad that they were proved wrong.[SEP]dispite the building work that it still going on, a number of months longer than expected, the hotel and its staff were excellant.[SEP]there was no queue for check - in, and they gave me the room i wanted.[SEP]the rooms were clean, and were above my expectation for a downtown hotel.[SEP]the staff were polite and attentive to any requests.[SEP]in all a nice hotel experience.[SEP]my only problem was with the location.[SEP]although fremont street was excellant and you can walk between the casinos, to get to the strip involved either an hour long trip on the deuce (bus), or a an expensive taxi ride.
0	we left petit lafitte early due to some annoying problems.[SEP](no hot water in our bungalow during our stay and small children playing (and crying) outside our bedroom window at various times of the day.[SEP](including 6:30am) our request to move to another room was denied, as they were apparently full.[SEP]their beach location is absolutely gorgeous, but the access coming and going to the hotel for day trips was almost impossible.[SEP]the restaurant and outdoor bar were very good, the staff o.k., but the inadequacies mentioned before did not justify their price.
0	stayed here 1 night.[SEP]room was nice and clean.[SEP]not a bad place but the location could be better.[SEP]very loud at night.[SEP]asked for a higher level room but it was still quite loud.[SEP]loud meaning traffic.[SEP]for $30 more we could of stayed at the westin or the w.[SEP]probably won't stay here again.[SEP]on the positive, a free shuttle from the hotel to within a 1 mile radius was a nice touch.[SEP]the beds are super comfortable.
0	we stayed in early october.[SEP]the hotel is large, well - equipped, full - service and has an excellent pool and spa suite.[SEP]it is on the expensive side, although the 17 euro breakfast is well worth it.[SEP]the room (we were in premium) was large and comfortable, though a tea - making facility would have been a useful touch.[SEP]the main drawback is the location.[SEP]the hotel is just inside the city walls and a frequent tram that stops outside the hotel takes you the center of the old town in about fifteen minutes, but much of the time the tram is very crowded.[SEP]we are used to the london underground, but the istanbul tram is tokyo - crowded.[SEP]it is quite unpleasant and a major consideration fro anyone staying.
0	about one third (300?) of the rooms are under renovation.[SEP]one third are waiting for renovation.[SEP]one third are newly renovated.[SEP]it´s very important to get the last mentioned (which was the case for our group of 39) the one´s i asked was satisfied with their rooms.[SEP]our room, and most, had a balcony, no noise, equipment and size normal for a 4-star in rome.[SEP](including flatscreen) the lobby is very elegant and big.[SEP]staff serviceminded above standard for rome.[SEP]breakfast the most tasty we had, in our tour including 8 hotels.[SEP]and served in a spacy, light and beautiful hall.[SEP](or, more right, in many different halls.) the one and big advantage with ergife is the location.[SEP]it´s not inside walking - distance from centre.[SEP]and it´s 16 - 17 min from metro.[SEP]but if you see it from the bright side: you have no noisy traffic around, and the taxi cost just 10€.[SEP]the 3 days we stayed, there was always cabs in front of the entrance.[SEP]ps.[SEP]i fully understand the one´s who not had known the importance of ordering a renovated room, and therefore became dissatisfied.[SEP](who could know before?)
0	i loved staying in this hotel.[SEP]the rooms were beautiful, the dining area was exceptional, and the food was amazing.[SEP]the only issue i had with the hotel was that it's location was difficult for us.[SEP]traffic is a real issue in istanbul, we were stuck in traffic in cabs up to 1 1/2 or 2 at a time during peak travel times.[SEP]most of the tourist attractions are in the old part of the city, and the hotel is in the new part, and is really too far to walk to the sites.
0	my family of three (2 adults, 1 six yr old) stayed here dec 27 - 29.[SEP]the room was comfortable -- down comforters, choice of soft / firm pillows, bottled water, clean bathrooms, free internet connection, free decent breakfast and secure ($14/day) parking.[SEP]be sure to ask for a room away from the elevators (noisy guests) and a city view -- we had an up - close view of the stadium.[SEP]i suppose we could have requested a different room but it was not a big deal.[SEP]the only major drawback of this hotel is the location.[SEP]it is at the very end of robson street, where there is no activity taking place except for a few homeless people mulling about.[SEP]that made things a little sketchy at night.[SEP]the hotel does everything to make you feel secure as you need your key card for practically everything.[SEP]still, we walked to robson in the morning but took cabs back in the evening.[SEP]the main shopping and dining areas are too far to walk roundtrip in the winter with a child.[SEP]perhaps ok for a couple.[SEP]nevertheless, it might make sense to stay in this comfortable hotel and save money, and then spend $5 - 7 dollars (one way) on a taxi for transportation to robson.[SEP]good location if you have a car and want to visit granville, space center, vancouver aquarium.[SEP](side note: driving around vancouver is like driving around nyc.)
0	my wife and i stayed here for a few days after i concluded a business trip elsewhere in town.[SEP]the room was very high in the tower with great views towards the smarter end of the strip and for the price we paid we certainly felt happy.[SEP]although the room was small (tiny in fact), it was clean, quite and it had everything we needed, the small kitchenette a nice bonus.[SEP]at the end of the day it was a relief to come back to a hotel that was off the tourist trail and with no casino it was very quiet.[SEP]although we appreciated its quiet location after 2 - 3 days the using the monorail or taxi's, the travel became tiresome, especially in the 105 degree heat.[SEP]thankfully we managed to avoid the sales pitch.[SEP]i wouldn't use the hotel again - it was simply too far from anything for our tastes.[SEP]but if you don't mind that and want value for money then its a perfectly decent hotel.
0	i just returned from a 4-day stay at this hotel.[SEP]the lobby and meeting rooms are quite lovely -- they have an old hollywood feel.[SEP]however, the rooms are in need of a serious update.[SEP]the rooms are large, but very dreary.[SEP]the window overlooked a brick wall, so there was hardly a chance for any sunlight.[SEP]the sheets were very low quality, the bedspread was dingy, the shower head had low water flow, the base of the vanity was some kind of painted plywood... i could go on and on.[SEP]the location is good only if you have a business meeting in downtown.[SEP]it's just not convenient to much else that tourists would like to see.[SEP]also, i just didn't feel that safe walking around on the weekend or in the evening.
0	not happy no chambermaid service.[SEP]had to make own bed.[SEP]no toilteries provided.[SEP]sent email after booking to request double and got two singles.[SEP]hotel also changed location....
0	very basic hotel, rooms are similar style to single rooms in a hostel.[SEP]the staff were poorly trained but very friendly.[SEP]my tv didn't work on arrival so i was moved to another room, then in the morning i was told i needed to move back to the original room.[SEP]when i pointed out that this was inconvenient to me i was told by 1 person that the new room was already booked out and by another person that the new room was only for emergencies.[SEP]i was moved back despite my objection.[SEP]the shower head also didn't stay up making showering difficult, although a wedged in soap helped.[SEP]location was useful for my purpose, but otherwise the " sauna bar " to next door and the hookers on the high street aren't a great look.[SEP]bed was very comfortable and the room was quiet.[SEP]a tip for the tv is that you can actually set the dubbed shows back to english, hit the green button on the remote.[SEP]don't do the breakfast![SEP]stale pastries and soggy cold bacon.[SEP]didn't try the eggs, because the tray was empty and wasn't re - filled for some time...
0	the hotel was nice enough.[SEP]it had a european feel to it, beautiful big furniture, a cozy little arrangement.[SEP]i couldn't sleep (it was ridiculously noisey all day and night) until i called downstairs and they were nice enough to give me a fan, so then i was finally able to fall asleep.[SEP]the hotel is so close to union square - so if you want to go shopping this is a good location.[SEP]it's right across from a walgreens which i found quite convenient as i always buy my water anywhere but at the hotel.[SEP]the breakfast is decent, room service just okay, takes quite awhile for it to come up which is fairly normal.[SEP]i didn't have any problems with the place, but i just wouldn't stay again b / c i wasn't impressed with san fran.[SEP]i was surprised at how dirty it was and all of the bums on the street.[SEP]i've traveled around everywhere but in san francisco the bums actually yell at people all the time![SEP]not all of them, but it was pretty significant.[SEP]the other touristy places i visited were just that.[SEP]next time, i'll skip it all and just stay in sonoma:)
0	hotel is just o.k. location is near the metro and the breakfast was good.[SEP]we had one room that us updated and it was nice.[SEP]i would not recommed this hotel to families.[SEP]it is to far from all the main attractions in rome.[SEP]however, if you are going on business and just needed to go from place to place vai themetro it is a great location.
0	to start with, the hotel wouldn't let us check in until 3 pm even though i have a hard time believing that no rooms were available until that time.[SEP]the front desk person was rude when we checked in and refused to stop the delivery of the usa today that we did not want.[SEP]the hotel smelled funky with the restaurant smelling particularly bad.[SEP]the internet connection is wired in the room and slow - too slow to even watch a 30 second video clip.[SEP]the sheets in the room had holes in them and so did the curtains.[SEP]there was also a large stain on the carpet.[SEP]however, the worst part of the stay was the hotel's utter disregard of people with disabilities.[SEP]during our stay at the hotel, there was a football team also staying there.[SEP]some of the players parked their vehicles in the disabled parking spots even though they clearly were not disabled and had no disabled decals or tags.[SEP]when i reported this to hotel management, they didn't care.[SEP]hotel security said they couldn't do anything because the hotel allowed it.[SEP]if the holiday inn does not respect the needs of people with disabilities then they will not get my business.[SEP]finally, this hotel is misleadingly named.[SEP]it is not in the main mission valley area where all the other hotels, restaurants and shops are located.[SEP]rather, it is several freeway exits north of this location.
0	we booked this hotel as we were travelling from las vegas to la by bus and it stopped outside the hotel, unfortunately this was the only good thing we could say about it.[SEP]do not be fooled by the reception area as the rest of the hotel is nt like it![SEP]this is a very basic poor hostel and not a hotel.[SEP]our twin room and private facilities were very small and shabby.[SEP]the beds were uncomfortable and the pillows were non existent.[SEP]the curtain did not close properly.[SEP]we did ask for an upgrade but were told that this was as good as it gets.[SEP]the reception staff were very unhelpful and were unable to offer advice and help about the area the hotel was in.[SEP]1 young lady pointed out the hotel on the map to us in the wrong location.[SEP]there were four locks on the inside of the door which left us a bit nervous as to the necessity for this.[SEP]there was also a huge crack in the shower tray.[SEP]all in all a very unpleasant stay and one we would definitely not repeat.
0	we stayed here for a weekend in august and as other reviewers have mentioned it's a bit tricky to find from termini station - the taxi driver had to ask his friend where the road was and noone will know where hotel donatello is, so don't lose the address.[SEP]maps at the hotel front desk don't all have the hotel marked on them (too far out!) the hotel is extremely nice.[SEP]our room on the top floor was immaculate and could be reached by the new elevator.[SEP]the bathroom was very modern even if the jacuzzi bath didn't bubble.[SEP]airconditioning, flat screen tv and safe all working well.[SEP]breakfast is taken in the little garden in a beautiful location but there is just coffee a croissant, roll and jams.[SEP]you can ask for very weak orange juice.[SEP]conclusion - a nice hotel in a suburban area.[SEP]you can walk 2 mins to porte maggiore and there's a good tram no.[SEP]3 there.[SEP]it's not a beatiful area of rome, but not the worst.[SEP]ps.[SEP]the area is a bit dodgy and about 10 mins walk from a metro.[SEP]beware pickpockets when walking around the streets - we had an unskilled one try who was very obvious and halfhearted!
0	this hotel is not only very poorly located (one has to wait for the hourly shuttle to take you anywhere - nothing is in walking distance), but it is also very very old.[SEP]everything is outdated, the carpets are musty, paint peeling on the walls, the bathroom counter tops are chipped.[SEP]the bar downstair is packed with clutter (see the picture i took in the bar - how can you relax with the place looking like this?!).[SEP]all in all the hotel is unkempt, dirty - looking and yucky smelling.[SEP]whoever came up with the interior decorating must have been on crack - it is uglier than ugly.[SEP]if you don't care about hotel cleanliness or good service, but just after a good price, then this place is for you.[SEP]if you are traveler looking for more classy digs, go somewhere else - you can find a much better hotel for the same price in hong kong.[SEP]and in a better location!
0	the ritz is no match for other luxury hotels in the city.[SEP]my favorites are the cirigan palace kempinski and the two four seasons - there are others.[SEP]let's start with what works - interior spaces (lobby, bar, restaurant, shops) are well appointed and comfortable and the service is attentive and welcoming.[SEP]location is poor and with istanbul traffic, coming and going for business or tourism a major undertaking and requires patience and waste valuable time.[SEP]the walls and doors do little to contain sound, the views are very urban and the hotel is surrounded with traffic.[SEP]the rooms are okay but a bit tired looking.[SEP]having seen better in the city, i would not return.
0	we stayed here at the end of a 5 week holiday on our way home to australia.[SEP]our room was on the 4th floor overlooking the railway.[SEP]as has previously been said, the room was either quiet with the window closed but sooo hot, or airy with the window open but sooo noisy that we couldn't sleep.[SEP]the location is okay during the week, but when we arrived at 6 pm on a saturday, there was nowhere nearby to get a meal (even the pub next door was closed for a private function!).[SEP]we had to eat in the hotel cafe - okay if you like microwaved meals![SEP]the room itself was clean and basic, and we were given more towels when requested.[SEP]we also contacted the hotel when we arrived at tower bridge railway station, but the member of staff who i talked to was only able to tell me to find tower gate station!?[SEP]as i had never been in london before and did not have a map at that stage, how was i supposed to find that station!![SEP]we finally asked a couple of policemen who directed us and this resulted in a long walk over the tower bridge pulling our cases.[SEP](i think the staff could have advised us that we were still some distance from the hotel and suggest we get a taxi).[SEP]the hotel is handy for the underground trains, and for the tower, however i can't recommend the hotel as we were unable to sleep due to the noise.
0	just got back from a week stay in vegas... ny ny hotel has great places to eat, hmmm that s about it... i spend over $100 a night for a thurs frid night stay..[SEP]ok i get it frid is busy, our room was so far from the elevator it was a joke..[SEP]i counted, it was 163 strides from the elevator to our room..[SEP]are you kidding me![SEP]the pool is very old and tacky, with no room..[SEP]the bed was old and not comfortable... i just did nt like the layout of the hotel..[SEP](especially compared to other hotels on the strip)... location is not the best on the strip, but the bus is convenient..[SEP]the front dest staff very unfriendly, however the bellhops and staff in the front of the hotel were great..[SEP]i find out when i get home i could have saved 25% if i had signed up on their email list???[SEP]wow why was this hidden from me?[SEP]do yourself a favor, stay at the golden nugget on freemont st..[SEP]we stayed there for the first 2 days.... what a difference..[SEP]amazing pool, cheap food, freemont exper is fun, and you can take the shuttle back and forth to the strip..[SEP]final insult ny ny they charged my debit card $50 buck to rent a movie, they said they would refund my card in 7 - 10 business days!!!![SEP]thanks..[SEP]never again..
0	we did something unthinkable for our trip to istanbul.[SEP]we got a package tour with air and hotel when we didn't know details on the flights nor the hotel ahead of time.[SEP]it was too good of a deal to pass up.[SEP]but you get is a nice hotel out in the sticks.[SEP]to be fair, the hotel is in fairly good shape with fairly spacious rooms, clean, a good choice of channels on the tv, free wireless internet and very good breakfast buffet.[SEP]the rooms themselves are starting to show signs of wear and tear.[SEP]a minor renovation will be in order soon.[SEP]my biggest complaint was location.[SEP]we normally like to get a hotel right in the thick of things so that we can stumble home at any hour of the day we wish.[SEP]the gunes is a ten minute walk to the zeytinburnu stop where you can pick up the t1 tram to the center.[SEP]the tram ride to sultanahmet is 25 minutes which is where most of the good stuff is located.[SEP]it is another 10 minutes or so to the other end, kabatas, where it is about another 10 minute walk to the palace.[SEP]that, to me, is too far away.
0	i stayed for a business trip mid september.[SEP]the room had no place for a single luggage and no desk for my computer.[SEP]the room was darkly lit, and received all the noise from the street below.[SEP]the location is terrible.[SEP]middle of nowhere in the far south east of the city.[SEP]i had a free day but couldn't organize myself properly because i was too far from all major attractions like eiffel, concord, etoile, champ elysee.[SEP]even st michel was a 25 min walking distance, the only main attraction which would be considered close enough.[SEP]i do not believe most of the reviews.[SEP]period.
0	stayed here for 3 nights on a cosmos tour.[SEP]a triple room in the hotel was twin beds and a put - me up bed - the room was too small to accommodate everyone.[SEP]breakfast was very busy but food was ok.[SEP]pool was a welcome break from the heat but the lifeguard was hopeless, he just didn't want to be there![SEP]terrible location.[SEP]wouldn't stay here again unless desperate.
0	the hotel seems to exist for meetings and conventions only.[SEP]it is in a remote location and far from the airport.[SEP]their shuttle only runs till 9 pm.[SEP]if you do not make the shuttle then be prepared for a $50.00 cab ride once at the hotel be prepared to be fleeced for the entire stay.[SEP]the small gift shop ran out of soda?!?.[SEP]it was $4.00 to buy a can of soda from the mini - bar.[SEP]there were no soda machines and there is no where in walking distance to purchase odds and ends at atypical retail price.[SEP]food prices were high and if your meeting breaks at noon then you will need to fight the crowds to get a table and eat.[SEP]this caused us to be late getting back to our meetings.[SEP]sadly, in spite of this predictable pattern the restaurants were poorly staffed for lunch.[SEP]several of the restaurants did not even offer lunch service.[SEP]room was large and well appointed.[SEP]meeting room had almost no outlets for laptop computers but were otherwise ok.[SEP]gym was nice as was the pool area.
0	this hotel is about what you would expect a super 8 motel to be: a bed in a room.[SEP]the rooms looked pretty clean, but one of ours strongly smelled of urine.[SEP]i asked the manager for another room, and he said they were full.[SEP]he was very nice about it, but we were stuck with the urine room.[SEP]the location is a little sketchy, but all the hotel doors face inward.[SEP]we were a little worried about our cars, so we made sure to get a spot in front of our room.[SEP]the walls are really thin, and there were some really loud guests next to us, so i didn't sleep well the first night.[SEP]if you're looking for a cheap room, you'll find it here.[SEP]just remember that you're only getting what you pay for.
0	read previous bad reviews about standard room so booked the level executive double room.[SEP]room was exactly as pictured in website photos.[SEP]the level rooms include breakfast, free wifi, nibbles and drinks in the level lounge.[SEP]lounge very comfortable and a good place to chill out.[SEP]buffet dinner in the place restaurant was horrible so don't waste your money going there.[SEP]didn't eat in the spanish restaurant.[SEP]not the best location to see london on foot.[SEP]close to underground station though.[SEP]can get better value for money elsewhere.
0	i don't know why they call this a resort.[SEP]it's not a resort, it's a hotel.[SEP]there are no spa services, no concierge, no massages or body treatments, no basketball, no putting green, no tennis court, no nightly entertainment.[SEP]really, it's just a hotel with a pool.[SEP]i guess they call it a' resort' so that they can be justified in charging a' resort' fee which is bogus.[SEP]music is loudly played at poolside at 9:00 a.m. sharp at poolside.[SEP]it was too bad that i'm a late sleeper and didn't appreciate getting woken up so early being that my room faced the pool.[SEP]for the price we paid for the' resort', i would've thought that the beach lounges and umbrellas would have been included, not an extra charge.[SEP]the location was off the beaten track so you definitely need a car.[SEP]i didn't feel that the lobby was anything to write home about - very cold and barren.[SEP]i think there are so many other better choices.[SEP]next time, i won't be staying here, more likely i'll stay at the hilton or the plaza which are better locations and are true'resorts'
0	i booked the hotel via hotwire when paying for an inner harbor location.[SEP]the quick and dirty is that the hotel is fine if you get a good rate and don't mind a walk through some seedy area's to get to the inner harbor.[SEP]the hotel itself is a historic landmark and the lobby and public area's still are a throwback to old times and are quite beautiful.[SEP]my kind sized room was larger than many hotel rooms i have stayed at.[SEP]i did not have any of the cleanliness problems of other reviewers.[SEP]the bed was great, bathroom was small, but i've been in smaller.[SEP]staff was very friendly.[SEP]my biggest complaint is the location.[SEP]i work in downtown los angeles and have no problem walking the streets after - dark.[SEP]so i figured i'd be fine on the 5 block walk to the inner - harbor, not so, i was looking over my shoulder constantly.[SEP]i took a taxi back for a mere 4 blocks rather than walk.[SEP]in la, the homeless leave you alone.[SEP]here, they were hotting and hollering at me.[SEP]didn't seem like the harmless type i am used to.[SEP]i hope not to have to return to baltimore again, but if i do, i will be staying right on the inner harbor.
0	my husband and i stayed over the 4th of july weekend.[SEP]the front desk staff were very helpful and friendly upon check - in.[SEP]the location is not too convenient unless you are using the convention center.[SEP]rooms are a reasonable size for a new york city hotel.[SEP]bathrooms are small, but very nice and clean.[SEP]we loved the bed - it had a memory foam mattress and was extremely comfortable.[SEP]the noise from the trains and the shop across the street did not bother us, but it probably helped that we always take a white noise machine with us to hotels.[SEP]neighborhood is industrial, but not unsafe.[SEP]some of the reviews have said the neighborhood is dangerous, but we did not feel that way.[SEP]you can definitely smell the horses from the barn next door, but not for long as we didn't hang out outside the hotel and went on our way.[SEP]on future visits, i would prefer to stay elsewhere, but mostly for location.
0	my wife and i stayed here for a weekend in december 2010.[SEP]we had read all the gushing reviews on tripadvisor and decided to stay here even though it was a little pricey (we paid $200 usd / night).[SEP]the location is not very good.[SEP]it is near two metro stops, and one of them (nation) is a hub for several different lines.[SEP]however it takes about 25 minutes from the time you leave the hotel to get to the main attractions near the louvre etc.[SEP]the hotel staff (basically one person who mans the front desk 24 hrs) were nice.[SEP]but it's not like they were incredibly helpful.[SEP]they were just average.[SEP]although i do not know how this compares to other hotels in paris.[SEP]the rooms were small, but well furnished.[SEP]the closet was very tiny.[SEP]there was no ironing board in the room, and they don't even have any at all in the hotel to lend.[SEP]the elevator in the hotel is very slow.[SEP]breakfast was 10 euros per person, but i would recommend eating elsewhere.[SEP]there is too much good food in paris to eat breakfast in the hotel, which was just ok but convenient.[SEP]if i hadn't seen all the incredible reviews on tripadvisor, i wouldn't have had such high expectations.[SEP]in the end it was a nice hotel, but nothing extraordinary.
0	we really enjoyed our stay in the junior suite october 22nd - 25th 2010.[SEP]the bed was very comfortable and the shower was big enough for two.[SEP]there was a huge jetted soaker tub and his and her sinks in the washroom.[SEP]the kitchenette was great for making our own breakfasts and storing our beer.[SEP]the only downside to staying at signature is the location.[SEP]if you are like us, you like to be a part of the action on the strip -- near and around planet hollywood area where it's always busy.[SEP]it took 15 minutes to get from our room to the proper exit of the mgm casino where you were right on the strip.[SEP]then you have to walk another 20 or so minutes to get to the area around planet hollywood.[SEP]we ended up spending more on cabs and time to get places than we saved by making our own breakfasts and having a nicer suite.[SEP]next time we would stay at planet hollywood or flamingo (but we prefer to be in the action of it all).[SEP]if you don't mind spending all your time at mgm or don't mind walking 40 minutes just to get to the middle of the strip, stay at signature!
0	i was surprised to see the fantastic reviews of this marriott since i had a totally different experience in my recent business stay in san diego.[SEP]the location of this courtyard is not what i would recommend for families, or any other travelers unless you are specifically going for nightlife.[SEP]my business associates and i were approached by a group of men demanding money on the street not even one block from the hotel around 11:00 p.m. we refused but there was a scene.[SEP]i would not want my family to encounter this on a trip to san diego.[SEP]the rooms were little and the bathroom even smaller.[SEP]the staff made an effort to enjoy themselves and acted friendly but they were not able to respond to simple requests at check in.
0	just wanted to say that i stayed here during the last night of a group tour.[SEP]this hotel had the most comfortable beds i found during my 2 weeks in italy.[SEP]of course, the location isn't great for sightseeing, but when i was there, a big shopping mall was being built right next door.[SEP]at least there will be something near the hotel when that's finished.[SEP]i'd recommend this place especially if you want to stay a night near the airport.
0	i booked this through hotwire, also 4 * in the west hollywood area.[SEP]iam a solo traveller and found this hotel to be too far away from everything.[SEP]i like to be in an area which is a safe walking distance to main strip for restaurants etc.[SEP]although the orlando had a few restaurants around it (within 10 minutes walk) i didn't feel safe walking back to the hotel after dark.[SEP]i found the rooms to be very good - huge rooms with a very comfortabel bed and i thought the bathroom was fine.[SEP]yes the lifts and the hallways are extremely dated however this didn't bother me as the room was not.[SEP]although small, the pool was lovely and i have to say the staff were great.[SEP]although close to the beverly centre and not too far from the outdoor shopping centre (about 10 - 15 minutes) i was disappointed with the location and will next time stay somewhere closer to the strip in true west hollywood.
0	the las vegas hilton was alot easier on the eyes once you got into the room.[SEP]i was so surprised at the updated decor.[SEP]the only thing was the service was not that great and i wish i would have done more research on the location.[SEP]i wanted to be where all the action is, but the hilton is located very far north on the strip.[SEP](totally my fault) we went for happy hour at this little mexican restaurant inside the hotel and i think the coctail waitress was late, because the bartender was by himself and was in the weeds from the time we got there until we left.[SEP]the hilton is ok, but shop around for better hotel deals before booking.
0	i noticed that other writers had differed on their opinion of this hotels location.[SEP]i would say that it was the hotels greatest drawback.[SEP]i was making a return trip to montreal after a brief visit in august.[SEP]the chateau versailles was mistakenly booked for me (i had wanted the meridien versailles across the street).[SEP]the hotel is great if you are visitng the sherbroke galleries or the museums.[SEP]however, for tourists wanting proximity to the metro, the old city or the mont royal area this is toooooo out of the way.[SEP]the hotel itself is located in two older buildings.[SEP]it has a very small lobby with staff that seemed less than enthusiastic.[SEP]i was in a really large room in what seemed like the basement.[SEP]the windows looked out on the sidewalk![SEP]the room seemed as if it was more for families.[SEP]the breakfast was okay.[SEP]there is also a nice bakery down the street for afternoon tea etc.[SEP]and you can dine in the museums.[SEP]there weren't any restaurants nearby, but a 20 minute walk to the st.[SEP]catherines shopping area yielded a lively restaurant scene.[SEP]i wouldn't recommend this walk after dark for a woman alone.
0	my fiancee and i stayed here for 3 nights in late november 2010.[SEP]we found the hotel to be very luxurious for the price and the staff were very friendly.[SEP]we stayed in 3 other omni brand hotels and we found the omni los angeles the best.[SEP]it's a shame that the location is not good as there is a lack of good dinning places during the week nights and the area does not feel safe during the night (and day).[SEP]it is also difficult to get to other tourist areas, would be good if they offered more alternatives in regards to transport.
0	room was very good, but no air - conditioning.[SEP]amenities were good, breakfast was good.[SEP]location is the negative point about this hotel.[SEP]it is far from the main turistic spots in the city.[SEP]staff was nice.
0	stayed in the hyatt regency for 1 week.[SEP]the service was excellent and prices to match.[SEP]rooms were big by hong kong standard and everything felt new and clean.[SEP]the location is not great but given the excellent public transport, it only took 20/25mins to reach kowloon and hong kong island which is super (air conditioned!).[SEP]the staff were very nice and always their to help.[SEP]the swimming pool was great as well but not quiet up to a 5 * rating.[SEP]the in - house spa treatment was top notch![SEP]overall, a great 5 * hotel and people on a budget should seriously consider this.
0	like a previous reviewer, my family came for a short visit to san francisco while spending the majority of our vacation time in beautiful lake tahoe.[SEP]having not visited the fisherman's wharf area for many years, the primary shock was finding the dirty, cheesy state of the wharf.[SEP]homeless folks and other unique characters along the streets caused us, my young daughter in particular, to be uncomfortable.[SEP]but within that disappointing aspect of the neighborhood, we found the holiday inn express a wonderful place to come home to.[SEP]the hotel seemed quite new and sort of boutique - like in its decor.[SEP]rooms and public areas were quite clean and the complimentary continental breakfast was much above average for " budget - style " accomodations.[SEP]staff was friendly and always helpful.[SEP]the rooms were smallish, and probably not large enough for 4 people, and our room was probably one of many without any view whatsoever.[SEP]thankfully we chose this hotel for easy access to the cable cars and other things on our " to do " list.[SEP]valet parking was $32.00 per day (before taxes).[SEP]i felt our car was fairly secure in that lot, however the hotel elevator takes anyone down to the parking area unsupervised.[SEP]for our personal tastes, we will likely try a downtown hotel next time we come to san francisco, not because of the hotel but because of our personal discomfort in the wharf atmosphere.[SEP]finding a good rate may be difficult, but location is important to us.
0	i stay at the sheraton in may 2008 at the bay tower.[SEP]the hotel locates in a very beautiful location with a fantastic view.[SEP]there is a nice path for jogging / walking and that is very nice and enjoyable.[SEP]however, the nice view has a price to pay as it is far from downtown.[SEP]there is no store nearby to buy personal items.[SEP]no easy public transportation is available, except taxi.[SEP]the parking fee at the hotel is quite high, about 20 dollars / day.[SEP]it is also very noisy as the san diego airport is nearby.[SEP]you can hear them almost all the time.[SEP]if you are a light sleeper, that could be a problem.[SEP]the hotel has internet connection but for a fee if you use it in your room, but you can work at the lobby for 1hr free of charge.[SEP]the one that i dislike the most is that you can not use the hotel's refrigerator for stocking your drinks.[SEP]the hotel will throw your stuff away and charge you 25 dollars each time for the rearrangement of the fridge.[SEP]we pay 300 dollars / night and can not use the fridge.[SEP]saying that, i really enjoy san diego.[SEP]the city is very beautiful and is a good place to visit.[SEP]next time, i would choose the hotel inside downtown that i could enjoy so many beautiful things nearby.
0	this is the fourth time i have stayed at the park lane.[SEP]again i received a warm welcome, a beautiful room and great food.[SEP]as always, the location is perfect.[SEP]there is nothing like waking up and looking out of the window at green park.[SEP]it is absolutely beautiful.[SEP]i will make my reservations for november soon![SEP]i would not think of staying anywhere else in london!
0	my husband and i stayed here for 2 nights, simply because we needed a budget hotel.[SEP]we stayed in a room with no windows, but the room was clean and surprisingly not musty.[SEP]very small room with basic amenities, but it is okay if you don't plan to stay in all the time.[SEP]the main thing that really annoyed me during my stay there was the very thin walls.[SEP]i could hear every little noise from outside, next door and upstairs.[SEP]it did not help that there were guests on the same floor that talked really loudly and had children running up and down the corridors at 8 in the morning (and the next day, it happened at 5.30am!).[SEP]also, i wasn't too happy with the location of the hotel.[SEP]it is quite far from the nearest mrt (you will definitely have to take a bus or cab to the station).[SEP]i really don't think i would ever want to stay here again.
0	i stayed with my partner for 4 nights at this hotel and we chose it primarily because of the sale price of $190 per night.[SEP]take into consideration that the hotel generally provides such a discount not earlier then 5 days before your check - in date.[SEP]we also hoped for moderate pricing for hotel services too, but it was not so.[SEP]wi - fi internet cost about $15 per day, local calls were also for a charge.[SEP]the location of the hotel is a little bit poor.[SEP]it is very hard to get to centrally located sites by foot.[SEP]we tried it at the first day, but then decided to take a taxi.[SEP]average taxi ride to times squire cost $10 - 12.[SEP]i liked room design, the furniture was not too tired, the only tired thing was a heater that worked not well.[SEP]the stuff at the reception was helpful and very good looking).
0	if you like to swim in the ocean, you'll want to skip this location.[SEP]the water is very rocky (large, mossy jagged rocks), lots of seagrass and brown water.[SEP]i travel to cancun every year and have never seen water like this.[SEP]the hotel put a concrete barricade out in the water which may account for the poor swimming and visibility.[SEP]a previous review said you could wear water shoes, but this would be impossible.[SEP]the beach is very crowded with beach chairs with the usual chair saving at 6:00 a.m. we encountered mostly french, germans and canadians.[SEP]the hotel was filled to capacity the entire time we were there.[SEP]there were also lots of children running wild.[SEP]the best restaurant was the mexican buffet.[SEP]the food in the other restaurants was about what you'd expect in an all- inclusive.[SEP]the alcoholic drinks were very weak, and tasted like dirty water.[SEP]we asked for shots to add to the drinks and were given them.[SEP]however the shots were watered down too.[SEP]the staff is very hard working and would respond when you smiled or spoke to them politely.[SEP]i would rate this hotel as a 1 - 1/2 star.
0	hotel is in a decent location, though not too convenient if you wish to be near orchard rd.[SEP]the services was excellent.[SEP]staff most helpful and went out of their way for all request.[SEP]the rooms were extremely disappointing.[SEP]old furniture and very dusty.[SEP]definatly not worth the price or the star rating in terms of general look.[SEP]neads an overhaul
0	we stayed at this hotel for 5 nights.[SEP]our room was a decent size, with a king size bed and a large bath facing the street on the fourth floor.[SEP]the shower leaked through the glass doors all over the floor and pooled into a corner.[SEP]also, our internet via wifi did not work at this location and so we had to use the hotel computer.[SEP]but the worst thing about our stay was that it seemed too expensive for the location and how loud it was to sleep at night.[SEP]its location is on what appears to be an alley and our room faced this street on the fourth floor.[SEP]it was loud at night and you had to suffer the at times too efficient air conditioning just so that you could drown out the din of loud voices and motor bikes at all ours of the night.[SEP]the location in terms of its proximity to sites is ok but one could do better in that regard.[SEP]the staff was nice, the breakfast was pretty good and the courtyard that it is served in is georgeous.[SEP]if i were to return to rome, i would not stay here.
0	absolute outstanding customer service by the front desk staff.[SEP]after confusion at our original booked hotel, the staff at this hotel came through with 3 rooms at 3 am in the morning(we looked for 5 hours after our origianl hotel bombed on confirmed reservations).[SEP]they could not be more accomadating- upgrading my husband and i to a business suite and my father and sister in law to deluxe singles.[SEP]breakfast - standard fare, don't get your heart set on good egg dishes and it is very crowded.[SEP]get down there early.[SEP]location?[SEP]it is a expensive taxi anywhere but if you are traveling as a group of 2 or more it is affordable by rome standards.[SEP]convenient shuttle to st.[SEP]peter's area of town.
0	i was drawn to the location due to its proximity to a gathering spot with friends and family.[SEP]i trusted the ratings.[SEP]i should have looked elsewhere.[SEP]while the room itself was ok - not great - the overall facility stank.[SEP]there is no parking on the level with the rooms - so if you are disabled, forget it.[SEP]the handicapped parking is down a hill - which i could not climb.[SEP]the courtyard was dirty and cluttered, the vending machines were old and one was out of service.[SEP](it didn't matter to me as the front desk would not make change for a $20 to get something out of them anyway.) i needed to get a cab and the front desk person was still very sullen - of course i wasn't happy after being denied change for a cold drink.[SEP]i wouldn't stay there again if they comped it to me.
0	spent a week here on a business trip.[SEP]staff was very friendly and helpful.[SEP]the room was extremely clean and comfy.[SEP]location isn't that great although it is fairly close to the airport.[SEP]there are only fast food restaurants in the immediate area but not much else.[SEP]i never really had a problem with noise although i keep my a / c or heat running constantly to help me sleep.[SEP]i never had a chance to check out the pool or fitness areas but they appeared to be nice.[SEP]my only issues would be with the location and very poor internet service.[SEP]they advertise " high speed " but it's far from that.[SEP]at best, it's slightly better than dialup which was frustrating for me when trying to take care of work issues online.
0	an old hotel in a residential part of town.[SEP]it is next to two main roads that gets very noisy.[SEP]poor breakfast service.[SEP]it is close to a metro station.[SEP]you will need it to get to all tourist sites.[SEP]not within walking distance of anything of interest.[SEP]might be worth considering paying more for central location and better facilities.
0	was there for 3 nights with my husband and hated the hotel.[SEP]1.[SEP]the air - conditioning in our room was a mess.[SEP]it would switch off on its own and we could nt get it fixed.[SEP]the repair person who came hardly understood english and i couldnot explain my problem to him.[SEP]2.[SEP]the refrigerator in our room whould freeze the milk we put in it.[SEP]there was no way to adjust the temperature.[SEP]only set to freeze.[SEP]3.[SEP]the housekeeping was lousy.[SEP]the did nt replace coffee and sugar in our room.[SEP]had to call several times to get it the next morning.[SEP]4.[SEP]location of the hotel is not great.[SEP]must stay in san juan instead.[SEP]5.[SEP]pool was not very clean.
0	we absolutely loved the hotel, but did not love that we were not in walking distance really to anything in boston.[SEP]we always took the t no matter where we went, as we were right by the silver line.[SEP]the restaurant was a little pricey, so we did not try, but the hotel definitely served it purpose.[SEP]does not include free wifi which is kind of annoying because of the price of the hotel.[SEP]also, the concierge was not very helpful either.[SEP]when we asked the best way to get to the hotel from the airport, they told us to take a cab.[SEP]we paid a ridiculous amount for a cab when we could've gotten to the hotel by the t.[SEP]i asked the concierge to help us find the mall in chestnut hill- she sent us on a wild goose chase downtown boston on boylston street.[SEP]turns out there is a boylston in boston and in chestnut hill.[SEP]you would think the concierge would know this.[SEP]regardless, the hotel is probably one of the nicest in boston.[SEP]i have stayed in three other hotels there and this one far surpasses in cleanliness, aesthetics, and roominess.[SEP]the others were nice based on location but were much smaller and generally not as nice.
0	we had a prepaid reservation and ended up spending to stay at a hotel in a better location.[SEP]unless you plan on taking the subway the entire time you are in rome, the location is far from the center of town and there are very few restaurants and bars nearby.[SEP]upon checking in the concierge was extremely rude and refused to apologize or accommodate our reservation for one bed (our room had two twin beds and this was our honeymoon!).[SEP]once we arrived in our room the toilet flooded the bathroom the first time we used it.[SEP]when we asked to have it fixed the man at the desk grumbled and moved us to another room (still with twin beds).[SEP]when we inquired about the wifi access he told us we had to pay and continued to mutter under his breath.[SEP]never once during our check - in process did he provide us with a map or welcome us.[SEP]he was incredibly rude![SEP]unfortunately, when we went back that evening to pick up our luggage to move to new hotel, the gentleman was very friendly and tried to make us feel welcome to stay.[SEP]if we had met him upon check - in we may have had a totally different experience.[SEP]we felt bad leaving because he was so kind and concerned (and a little confused as we had paid for two nights that we did not use).[SEP]also, the room does not have a mini - bar unless you consider a bottle of water in a dirty refrigerator a minibar.[SEP]i would look for a better valued hotel in a better location before booking here.
0	we booked this hotel for four nights.[SEP]on arrival we found that there were no tea / coffee making facilities in the rooms (we had late flights and did not check in until 1 in the morning).[SEP]breakfast was fruit juice, cold coffee and sticky buns.[SEP]staff i have to say were unpleasant and rude and didn't want to be bothered by guests.[SEP]the so called " bar " did not open while we were there and when we requested some hot water for tea, they would not give us any saying all was shut since 10 am!!![SEP]the rooms were a good size, the beds were very clean and very comfortable.[SEP]a good size wardrobe and a safe which you programme yourself also in the room.[SEP]the bath room was clean but a little dated.[SEP]needs to be refurnished.[SEP]each room had a fridge with bottles of water and soft drinks put in each day (although the one in our room did not work!).[SEP]the corridors were not lit and only waited lit up for about 15 seconds when you switched the lights on.[SEP]overall the location of the hotel is too far out from the city.[SEP]the 105 bus takes between 30 -45 mins depending on traffic.[SEP]this was normally very crowded.[SEP]the tram also runs beside the bus stop to the city.[SEP]quicker to get there but not by much.[SEP]it will not bring to the main train station (termini) like the bus will.[SEP]overall i could nt recommend this hotel.
0	enjoyed this 1-year old chic hotel with very helpful staff.[SEP]temperpedic beds a plus and so are the huge bathrooms.[SEP]the deck had great views of sunsets and the fire pit was fun to gather around.[SEP]restaurant looked great but we ate in san diego dining spots.[SEP]no pool.[SEP]mission beach however has tons of seaweed, more flies than i've ever seen in a sandy location and unfortunately, homeless people.[SEP]the hotel is right on the boardwalk and looks out at beach.[SEP]did go to tijuana and had a great time, no one bothers you more than one time and we had fun shopping and eating.
0	the service, the room.[SEP]helpfulness of staff, everything.... was perfect![SEP]perfect location in montreal which is located at the end of montreal island but close to nature.[SEP]one of our friends recommand this motel to us.[SEP]we go there with our bicycles.[SEP]we have a wonderful ride beside the river.
0	we find this hotel lovely apart from its location.[SEP]it's about 25 min walk from the nearest station.[SEP]but all else were good, the staffs were friendly and helpful.[SEP]the bed was clean and bathroom was reasonable sized.[SEP]the design of the hotel was modern.
0	i stayed here for business last year, and enjoyed the experience so much that i decided to stay here again while on vacation (i'm usually a loyal sw member) good: room: we stayed in a one room suite with whirlpool hot tub.[SEP]the suites are very well done with comfortable furniture, nice enclosed patio, two tvs (large one in the living room, smaller one in the bedroom), and washer / dryer.[SEP]front desk staff & concierge: very helpful with check in ; even booked us a dinner reservation for later that night.[SEP]ok: location: great if you're going to seaworld or the international drive strip.[SEP]not an ideal location if you're visiting the disney parks (~20 - 30 min drive).[SEP]bad: timeshare sales pitch: when we checked in, we were asked to vist the concierge desk where a nice gentleman presented us with a' bonus 10,000 hilton points' certificate.[SEP]the catch?[SEP]we had to show up at 8 am the next morning for a time share sales pitch.[SEP]we didn't enjoy this sales pitch at all ; this rubbed us both the wrong way.[SEP]overall, a very nice hotel resort with a great tropical theme.[SEP]opt for the one bedroom suite with whirlpool if you can ; that was the key differentiator for us when we decided to stay here during vacation.
0	i stayed at this hotel for a conference at a nearby location.[SEP]it was okay, a mixture of plus and minus points.[SEP]i was upgraded to a two - level " suite " because the hotel was full, which was nice, but did involve going up and down stairs between the bedroom area and the bathroom.[SEP]the room overlooked the street, and was pretty noisy, as was the air conditioning / heating system.[SEP]this last was controlled within the room, and was quick and accurate, though.[SEP]the hotel is opposite a grocery store, which was convenient, but i didn't feel safe walking alone between nearby locations at night so had to take cabs.[SEP](a friend of mine was not bothered by this.) there was a complimentary breakfast which was very pleasant and extensive for this kind of hotel - it included hot oatmeal, bagels, toast, cinnamon rolls, a variety of cereals, juices, fruit and coffee.[SEP]service was unpredictable: the first day i got a very friendly welcome and extra blankets arrived at my room within minutes.[SEP]the second night however i was treated extremely rudely by another employee who refused to provide government tax forms (which were then supplied easily by another employee the next morning).[SEP]also, the air conditioner placed over the head of the bed was faulty and started dripping in the middle of the night... like the rest of the room is seemed very dated and old.[SEP]for the price and convenience it was okay for this business trip, but i wouldn't stay here for pleasure!
0	the rooms are fairly nice, as is the casino.[SEP]the location is a bit far from other casinos.[SEP]the bar at the top us amazing but cocktails are very expensive.[SEP]the view of vegas is beautiful.[SEP]thier buffet is very basic but reasonable.[SEP]friendly bar staff.[SEP]if your on a budget, this hotel us fine.
0	we stayed here for three nights.[SEP]i reserved a rate on the internet that was for no eu people only that when we checked in we were told that we had to pay in cash even though under the payment terms on my confirmation it did not say that anywhere.[SEP]long story short the staff on check out was snotty and used the excuse of " pay with cash or pay a higher rate (about 80 euro a night higher) to be able to use our credit card ".[SEP]no where on the confirmation did it say that.[SEP]the rooms are glorified dorm rooms.[SEP]the walls are a drab gray.[SEP]the windows let in almost no light.[SEP]the sky tv is really spotty to the point that just leaving the tv off is a better option.[SEP]the beds are very hard and the top comforter had what looked like a blood stain near the bottom on it.[SEP]the bathroom is tiny, which is fine, but there was no counter space and the shower is super small (think coat closet small).[SEP]the location is ok if you're only going to the vatican but i would not say to stay here if you're going to spend the majority of your time in the central core.[SEP]basically i would never go back.[SEP]and i hate the " pay cash, you're american " crap.
0	awful hotel ; i stayed in better motel 8s.[SEP]rooms are noisy (loud air - conditioning+highway noise) and dirty.[SEP]there was no shampoo (i had to ask for it specifically).[SEP]beds are uncomfortable.[SEP]pool reminds me a municipal pool in brooklyn ; the 25th floor adult only european sunbathing pool is a joke ; it has the ambiance of a high school parking lot.[SEP]the hotel leads you to believe that the rooms are in the tower ; but they are in a separate buildings.[SEP]location is also bad ; it is the last hotel on the strip and the neighborhood is very unattractive.[SEP]rooms in riviera (several blocks toward the civilization) are much nicer.
0	we were suppossed to have a non smoking room and it was obviously a smoking room.[SEP]we asked if we could have a non smoking room and they said there was none available.[SEP]even when i brought out my paperwork he said they could not help us... however they could spray something in the room to make it smell better and if we wanted to upgrade... then we could have a non smoking room.[SEP]the elevator was broken for the last 3 days of our trip.[SEP]our remote control quite working on day 3 and we complained about it... finally we bought our own replacement batteries.[SEP]the hotel is entirely too spread out.[SEP]they change what restaurants serve what when and what the dress code is depending on the location.[SEP]overall bad experexience a this hotel!!!
0	this hotel was quite disappointing.[SEP]i payed 120 euros per night for a single room over easter, which isn't cheap and it just didn't deliver.[SEP]room itself was ok, but location is so - so at best.[SEP]this hotel seems to get great reviews because of its nice owners.[SEP]they do seem nice, but i was mainly dealing with another guy who wasn't friendly at all.[SEP]on my last night when i arrived at 11 pm he insisted that i payed the bill right then and not the following morning as they would be busy then serving breakfast.[SEP]and when i went out onto the street to get the money and paid, i was told the 5% cash payment discount wasn't for me as i had booked through venere.[SEP]this hotel is not bad, it's just bad value for money.[SEP]my other two nights in rome i spent in a similar room, in a better location, with better breakfast, with better service for just 80 euros per night.[SEP]so think again when booking this place, as this place is overrated.
0	stayed at the donatello on a weekend break with my husband.[SEP]very easy to find from the termini rail station - catch the 105 bus and it's 4 stops from there, just across the road.[SEP]first impressions were' iffy', like the real thing doesn't match any web photos![SEP]area is a little run down, lots of graffiti but that's true of many areas of rome.[SEP]but, we were given a lovely little room with a nice bare brickwork ceiling, and all mod cons.[SEP]room was a little small but spotlessly clean.[SEP]breakfast however is a big let down.[SEP]just croissants, french toast and honey or jam, in a rather non - atmospheric room in the basement.[SEP]there is no restaurant or bar at the hotel.[SEP]location wise, it's not too bad as you can walk to the colosseum in around 10 mins.[SEP]not much in the way of restaurants and bars close to the hotel so maybe not a good choice for lively guests.[SEP]saying that, the buses are very easy to use if you wish to travel to other parts of the city (and cheap or even free... nobody checks whether you validate your ticket on the machine in the bus).[SEP]would i return - maybe.... if they sorted their breakfast out and provided a bar![SEP]overall, its good value for money.
0	my first stay was in 2010 and this was my second time staying here.[SEP]they're still supposedly going through a renovation process although i haven't noticed any changes.[SEP]rooms are old, outdated and drab although my bed was comfortable.[SEP]breakfast buffet area is my favorite part about the hotel.[SEP]they cater to both american and chinese tastebuds and serve a large variety with a station serving fresh waffles, pancakes, omelettes, eggs.[SEP]also the servers are friendly and quick.[SEP]and that's about all that is good with the hotel.[SEP]the location sucks, not that i'm too fond of dt la to begin with.[SEP]my biggest gripe is the lack of security.[SEP]they have one security personnel that oversees the entire property![SEP]this is downtown l.a. where the homeless are everywhere, and apparently including the inside of the hotel lobby.[SEP]you would think people at the hotel would notice them walking in and say something.[SEP]when i asked about the homeless woman walking around in her socks, they said they would not approach her because she might have been a guest.[SEP]well that woman ended up attacking me, and guess what, she was homeless.[SEP]i guess one security officer would have been fine if they had cameras monitoring the property 24/7.[SEP]but again, nope.[SEP]they have cameras that only rotate around.[SEP]useless.[SEP]needless to say, i will not be staying here again.
0	we chose a2 k hotel through booking.com.[SEP]the price looked good for a 3 star hotel and the location of the hotel met our need to stay in the centre of montreal as a base for our visits.[SEP]the hotel is in the centre but the surroundings are really horrible.[SEP]furthermore it is in a main and very noisy street that makes sleeping almost impossible.[SEP]the hotel owns a restaurant so at night it may happen that people coming out of the restaurant make a lot of noise.[SEP]our room was on the first floor towards this main street.[SEP]the room was very small, without a wardrobe and a light a part from a lamp on a bedside table.[SEP]the sheets were filthy with hair and other organic materials (certainly not coming from my girlfriend and myself).[SEP]the bathroom was dirty too, especially the sink, the towels were dirty too, ripped and with holes.[SEP]the breakfast was served in a dirty room on dirty tables and dirty dishes, with little choice and bad quality products.[SEP]we don't understand how this hotel was ranked 3 stars by montreal tourist office.[SEP]very expensive for the service it offers montreal was very nice but coming back to the hotel in the evening ruined the romantic atmosphere of the city, besides the tiring sleepless nights.
0	this hotel is not bad.[SEP]clean room, but out of date ; good room service, but slow and it came in cold ; and near a metro and south sea port.[SEP]not a fancy place, but okay for a quick nyc trip.[SEP]however, it is not a great location for night activities.[SEP]we had the hardest time finding cabs in and out of that area, specially on weekends.[SEP]decent spot for business travel, i'm sure.
0	we stayed at this hotel for 5 nights mid april.[SEP]yes a credut card was asked for at check in but this is soemthing which i experience when i check in at uk hotels now so was not a problem.[SEP]the room was of adequate size with a comfy bed with crisp clean sheets & huge pillows.[SEP]private bathroom with plenty of clean linen and complimentary toiletries.[SEP]we had a problem with trying to work out how to use the shower but when we enquired at reception, someone came up to our room straight away and got it sorted for us.[SEP]true what previous reviews say about location but once you have got the subway sorted then it is not a problem.[SEP]we had a great view of central park & we did not experience the noise which other reviewers have noted.[SEP]the only thing which i did miss not having was a kettle to make a cup of coffee in the morning but there is a vending machine in the basement which despenses soemthing which nearly resembles coffee!!
0	within 15 minutes of arrival my wallet was stolen from our room by a man who informed he needed to check the airconditioning.[SEP]as our room was on the 5th floor, i would seriously question the security of this hotel before booking a stay there.[SEP]the staff were helpful with regard to cancelling the credit cards and promptly taking us to the police station to report the crime.[SEP]we were also given an upgrade, as we no longer felt comfortable in our allocated room.[SEP]location was a little out of the way from the centre but courtesy bus was very reliable and much needed.[SEP]the hotel was very clean and rooms very comfortable.[SEP]thought given to extras such as bathrobe and slippers in the bathrooms.[SEP]the staff were courteous at all times.[SEP]the hotel itself was lovely.
0	we stayed prior to, and following, a cruise and were very happy with what we got for the price.[SEP]we booked through the 1 - 800 number and were served by a very helpful gentleman who got us the' fly, stay, and cruise' package -- includes the shuttle to the ship (savings of $12 p.p.). the hotel is older, but has newly renovated bathrooms, comfortable beds, is neat and clean, and has very helpful and friendly staff.[SEP]the breakfast is great and is served in a large area that becomes a restaurant in the evening.[SEP]we stayed 2 nights and it appeared to be a popular place since the breakfast area was packed both mornings.[SEP]the only downside to this hotel is its location (far from downtown) but they do have a shuttle that will take you to a mall (which we did not use) as well as the free airport shuttle (easy to book at the front desk).[SEP]we got back early from the cruise, and although our room was not ready, they gave us a secure place to store our luggage and gave us a room as soon as one was cleaned.[SEP]excellent staff.
0	stayed in late october, this hotel completely ruined our weekend, holiday, and entire seattle experience.[SEP]to begin, the location made us feel like we should have been working on the adjacent street corner.[SEP]dodgy characters, frightening passers - by, and so many prostitutes it may have well just been a brothel.[SEP]given the price paid, the quality / cleanliness of the room wasnâ€ ™ t a complete shock.[SEP]what really made this awful was the rude, unhelpful and downright cruel attitude of the staff.[SEP]immediately upon checking in, we realized we would rather be staying in a tent (as was suggested by another dissatisfied guest in an october 30 review).[SEP]we called down to inform them of the numerous problems (burnt out lights, drafty windows, filthy bathroom, noise from the freeway, just to name a few) and phoned to complain.[SEP]rather than offering any sort of solution, apologizing, or even acknowledging our awful experience, we were met with indignation and rudeness.[SEP]nothing was done to remedy our complaints.[SEP]no other accommodations were available for us in the city, so alas, we were stranded in a weekend of squalor.[SEP]the manager was conveniently unavailable throughout the entire stay, and the rest of the interactions with the staff on hand were appalling.[SEP]more problems with the room presented themselves, including a condom in our nightstand and a crazed out shower head.
0	we booked this hotel through expedia, 2 adults 2 children.[SEP]the metro is not 5 mins away but a good 15 min walk and with suitcases and bags was awfull.[SEP]on arrival we were given a map of rome and shown to our room.[SEP]the hotel is dark, dirty and in much need of an renovation.[SEP]our room had the shutters down so no natural sunlight.[SEP]the beds were like sleeping on concrete and the air con did not work.[SEP]which considering it was over 70 degrees was a nightmere.[SEP]the staff were not pariculary helpfull.[SEP]the breakfast was vile.[SEP]dirty tables, food left in a stainless steel food warmer for what looked like hours.[SEP]very little choice of food.[SEP]the local attractions are only reachable via metro, unless you are prepared to walk for miles and miles or be ripped off in a taxi.[SEP]the vatacin is a good 25 min walk to the main entrance, the vatican museum is approx 10 min walk away.[SEP]i would never stay in this hotel again, its shabby, dirty and in a poor location, in the middle of a residental area.[SEP]we had a view of a football court and blocks of flats.[SEP]i would never recommend this hotel and it should not be classed as 4 star but 2 star would be better suited.[SEP]worst hotel i have ever stayed in europe.
0	visited aria this week for one night as an invited guest... not my cup of tea - much prefer bellagio, venetian or wynn.[SEP]here are the pluses and minuses from my perspective..[SEP]pluses * new * super - comfy beds * some really nice dealers * $10 craps all night long minuses * sterile, dark casino * high limits (i like $25 table games, but there were few to be found) * remote location - too damned far from everything... * rooms are too techy - remote controls for everything.[SEP]i didn't like that at all.[SEP]* strange shower / tub layout and toilet behind frosted glass wall.[SEP]really?[SEP]why???[SEP]* a / c made strange noises all night long and din't run properly.[SEP]* got screwed on my comps when departure - " attitude " from the front desk guy wasn't cool.[SEP]this may be a great place for some, but it just doesn't compare to my favorite places.[SEP]will not repeat.
0	travelling as a couple and looking forward to visiting friends in toronto, we were really disappointed with the sutton.[SEP]would agree with some of the not so positive reviews on here.[SEP]it was very run down, eerie corridors with no windows, musty and sometimes unpleasant smelling corridors.[SEP]on the positive side our room was clean and had good air - con.[SEP]in terms of location, it's really close to bloor - yorkville with the great shopping but it's nearly 15 blocks from the harbour and other trendy parts / tourist parts of town e.g. king street, hockey hall of fame etc.[SEP]would not recommend.
0	i am writing this to say that i think some of the posts about luna blue are fabricated.[SEP]my fiance and i went to luna blue to see if it would be a good place for people in our wedding party to stay this fall.[SEP]since it had such a high rating on tripadvisor i had high expectations, and was shocked to find that the location and hotel itself are nothing noteworthy and there are great places nearby that are just as good, for less.[SEP]don't think you are going to have the best stay of your life here.[SEP]this is more on backpacker level than anything else.[SEP]wouldn't trust most of these posts.
0	stayed in queen suite.[SEP]very small room, clean.[SEP]nice swimming pools, table tennis, shuffle board, on site groceries.[SEP]seaworld entrance is about 1 mile away, and park requires much walking between attractions.[SEP]hotel offered very limited shuttle service - 8:20 am and 10:20 am.[SEP]seaworld opens at 9 with shows starting at 10 am.[SEP]also, return shuttle was limited.[SEP]thus, we drove to seaworld, parking for $10, obviating the benefit of the hilton " seaworld " location.[SEP]concierge desk marginally helpful for tickets and arrangements.[SEP]when i asked about purchasing seaworld tickets, i was directed to a second person at the desk who turned out to be selling hilton real estate in exchange for free tickets.[SEP]once he found out my spouse was not available, the offer of free tickets was withdrawn.[SEP]wasted my time, i was not interested in sales pitches, just a seaworld vacation.[SEP]for now, best to show southwest airline rapid rewards card (can be printed on from internet) at seaworld entrance for a 20% discount, and validate tickets on exit for a free second day.
0	you should realize that somethings not right when you've booked a three star hotel but the sign outside says its a four star.[SEP]we wouldn't give it a two star![SEP]this hotel is rubbish![SEP]it's not in a prime location of amsterdam and you need to get a tram there from the station.[SEP]the staff ignored us when we tried to book in and were quite obnoxious.[SEP]they weren't very helpful and not pleasant at all.[SEP]the room was very disappointing, as it had not been cleaned from the previous occupant.[SEP]we had to empty the fridge, dispose of bathroom waste and generally tidy up.[SEP]during our five day stay it wasn't cleaned once.[SEP]with wall paper torn and hanging off in places it was very untidy and dusty.[SEP]breakfast was ok but nothing special.[SEP]it tarnished our stay in amsterdam as everyone else we met was friendly and provided good customer service.[SEP]not recommended!
0	service and decor is good but location is a bit out of the way for walking and for taxis and the rooms were small.[SEP]i got a club room on expedia for $300 a night - breakfast, evening cocktails and free wifi included.[SEP]its not on orchard road (being right at the end) and taxis do not naturally go there so had a long wait on many times.[SEP]staff are very good, the club room menu was extensive and good but the room was small (modern though).[SEP]again its one of those 3 and half stars better than average but not very good
0	this is a very ill - kept place.[SEP]the carpet in the room was so dirty that it painted my socks and feet black as i walked around.[SEP]the bathroom was barely ok, i dared not sit on the chair, and the bed was suspicious.[SEP]and it's certainly not in the price range where this is the norm.[SEP]the breakfast is a joke, even if you get a chance to sit in the " dining room " that can only seat about four people, i suggest going to the mall on the other side of the road for a quick bite.[SEP]during my stay the " menu " was lukewarm coffee, orange juice, and individually packaged magdalenas.[SEP]as for the location, uw is very close, but not much else in seattle is.
0	booked the best western shaftsbury paddington on a premier web site stating " 4 * luxury hotel with excellent location next to paddington street station - lies how does this company get away with distorting the truth!![SEP]on arrival at 10 am on a sat morning just checking in for two nights and asked could we drop of the bags and head for the day the receptionist explained they had a broken boiler and would need to move us hotels - so they moved us to the lancaster gate hotel - woo hoo!!![SEP]what a hotel is was beautiful this is what i call 4 * unfortunately we had to move back the next day to the best western - so pack up are stuff and headed back the next day!![SEP]what a downer:(from luxury to a dump!!![SEP]they upgraded us to a club room for all our inconvenience this was a joke the room was a box![SEP]cobwebs in the corners, silver fish in the bathroom, tv did not work it was dark & dingy!![SEP]paddinton station was 10mins walk away.[SEP]do n’t stay in this hotel if you are looking to stay in this area stay in the lancaster gate hotel or the hilton paddington - from a 32 year old irish lass
0	the hotel is new and of good standard.[SEP]the location is not great but within walking distance to 2 metro stations.[SEP]ok area.[SEP]the room is clean, a great bed, nice bathroom and a effective and quiete aircon.[SEP]the service is great and the english skills are sufficient.[SEP]they have 24 hour open bar which they promote by not having a minibar or a refrigiator in the room.[SEP]this would be the perfect value for money hotel if they provide free wifi and a small refrigiator in the room.[SEP]overall ok value for money and would recomend
0	stayed here for business.[SEP]the hotel is fine.[SEP]the location is in chinatown so not necessarily a great neighbourhood but alright.[SEP]it's close to the subway which is good.[SEP]the rooms are a bit small but was clean and has what you need.[SEP]the subway runs under the building so i would hear and feel it every once and a while but didn't bug me too much.[SEP]my room was $300 which was a bit pricey for what i got.[SEP]room had free wirelesss which was useful.[SEP]staff were friendly and helped book me a taxi back to the airport.[SEP]all in all it is an okay hotel but expensive for what it is.
0	i booked a two - bedroom suite for a mid - week stay.[SEP]the location is a fair walk up the hill from north sydney train station / shops, but its in a residential area so its quiet.[SEP]the reception area is modern and the staff are very helpful, however, i was disappointed by the room considering the price i paid.[SEP]the room was clean but it was shabby and out - of - date.[SEP]the paint was chipped and the woodwork was worn and split.[SEP]there were no working lamps and the bathroom was tired and worn out.[SEP]the beds were comfortable but the kitchenette was not well appointed.
0	i thought it sounded good and 5star review nailed it but: 1.[SEP]rooms tatty - less than 3star standard.[SEP]2.[SEP]service arrogant 3.[SEP]location (if you don't have a beach side room) poor - little better than a motel![SEP]4.[SEP]not a lot around it to do... which is ok if you don't like doing anything![SEP]5.[SEP]supermarket (only one small one which sold nothing!) expensive.[SEP]6.[SEP]pools packed at weekends... on a good point has loads of potential and nice gardens - but not any better than 3star![SEP]honest!
0	i stayed in this hotel for a week in july.[SEP]i agree with the other reviewers that it is not really a five star hotel.[SEP]the pool is nice, the rooms clean and fairly spacious - the ac in mine worked fine, indeed very well - and the food in the hotel's restaurant was excellent, actually.[SEP]but for the prices being charged you can, i am sure, find much nicer accommodation in istanbul.[SEP]the one thing readers need to be aware of is the location - the green park bostanci is in, well, bostanci.[SEP]in visitor or tourist terms this is the middle of nowhere.[SEP]don't look at a map and think that you can get in and out of the city centre in minutes - istanbul is a big city and the traffic is pretty horrendous.[SEP]though there are places to eat and shop within a fifteen minute taxi ride, and there is a taxi rank right outside the front door, the area round the hotel itself is a real wasteland in food, drink, shopping and entertainment terms.[SEP]if i were coming back to istanbul for a holiday or to visit friends i would certainly stay elsewhere, largely on the basis of location and poor value for money.[SEP]if you need to be in this area of the city on business, and someone else is paying the bill, then you may have an enjoyable stay.
0	this hotel isnoisey.[SEP]i could hear the people in the other room talking very clearly.[SEP]the windows are not insulated and so you feel like there are no windows at all![SEP]the rooms are tiny and old.[SEP]we had a 19 inch old tv on a barely standing table.[SEP]the service was nothing extraordinary.[SEP]the only good thing about this hotel is the location
0	it's obviously an older hotel but has recently received some good updates.[SEP]the lobby, courtyards and rooms are very nice now.[SEP]the one thing they can't as easily change is the location... next door to a gas station, looks at the main highway and is not in walking distance to anything.[SEP]the staff and concierge were very friendly and helpful.[SEP]their are courtyards with fire pits and dining options.[SEP]the concierge lounge (i'm not sure what you need to be able to use the lounge) offers continental breakfast daily ; but we didn't take part in it b / c there are so many breakfast places to go outside of the hotel.[SEP]there are complimentary wine tastings in the lobby from 5 pm - 6 pm each night.[SEP]there is a gorgeous bar / lounge in the lobby, with a restaurant but we didn't ever order food.[SEP]if you're spending most your time in the city of napa this hotel location is fine ; but if you plan on spending most of you time in surrounding towns then you might find a better location.[SEP]the only reason we'll stay here in the future is if we book with points again.[SEP]there are just too many quaint places to stay in the valley!
0	room was clean enough but the hotel is a little tired.[SEP]we requested the 2 bedroom suite for 4 of us, arrived at 3:00pm and had to wait 90 minutes to check in as apparently the room needed a " deep clean ".[SEP]not a great location other than its 10 minutes from the airport, note this hotel is directly on the flight path vs its sister hotel over at blue lagoon which is more modern and the rooms updated and seemed to be a little larger for the same cost.[SEP]staff friendly, breakfast was fine.[SEP]ok for a 1 or 2 night stay.
0	booked myself into this hotel for two nights stop over as part of my trip to asia and europe.[SEP]hotel is located at the top of the hill at outram park - it is a good 10 mins walk to the nearest mrt station.[SEP]with singapore humidity and temperature at mid 30c, 10 mins walk under the sun is rather challenging.[SEP]check - in was swift, got a room facing the hill.[SEP]room was absolutely tiny - has 2 single beds, a desk with a lcd tv hung onto the wall.[SEP]bathroom was tiny but clean.[SEP]they even give you toothbrush but it is very much a single use disposable type.[SEP]the theme of the hotel and room is very 70s retro - pictures are reflective of the hotel and room.[SEP]the room is so tiny that you can hardly fit two large suitcases in.[SEP]luckily i was on my own and have minimal luggage.[SEP]breakfast was included in my room booking - food at the restaurant was average.[SEP]for the two days that i had stayed there, they served identical buffet breakfast.[SEP]it fills you up if you put quality aside.[SEP]overall, i rate this as a cheap and cheerful hotel.[SEP]hotels at singapore are very expensive so it is very much what you pay is what you get.[SEP]would i come back to this hotel?[SEP]probably not - location is a bit out of the way.[SEP]10mins walk is too much for me at 35c and 90% humidity.[SEP]will i recommend this hotel to anyone?[SEP]yes, this is good value for someone with tight budget.
0	hotel was nice enough, the room we stayed in was clean and had just been updated, very spacious.[SEP]pool area was lovely, great for children.[SEP]the hotel had a film night around the pool and handed out popcorn for all the children.[SEP]dining wasa little pricey, but there was a small coffee shop selling coffee and muffins for breakfast.[SEP]one disadvantage was location, you needed a car to get into downtown.[SEP]old town was not too far away, so we did hire a taxi that evening.[SEP]tour bus collects passesngers each morning at 9 and 10.00, but the return was far too early, returning between 4 - 5.30.[SEP]although a nice hotel, i wouldn't stop there again, preferring something closer to the amenties and restaurents of san diego
0	the peal has great aesthetic value, really nice modern reno, but the stay was definitely average.[SEP]rooms are very basic and the bathrooms / showers could use an update (and had a funny, musty smell.) not sure if i would agree with their definition of " fine boutique accommodations ".[SEP]the restaurant on the weekend was great - very lively and delicious food.[SEP]if you're looking for nightlife outside of their own restaurant on the weekends (we were disappointed to find that they close up at 10:30 sharp weekdays) and don't have a car, not the best location.[SEP]we booked through tablet hotels and the location said la jolla - well, it's close to, but a 20 minute drive on the freeway.[SEP]so not much to do at night in the area after 10:30.[SEP]also sad that the pool wasn't heated, even on two 28 degree days.[SEP]bike rentals were much appreciated - we biked to ocean beach (the closest beach) which took about 45 minutes (but the la jolla beaches were much better).[SEP]the pearl staff themselves were pretty apathetic - must be the hip environment.[SEP]housekeeping was great.[SEP]all in all an average stay, after all it's $99/night.
0	i have stayed for four nights this month of march.[SEP]the first night they gave me a single room which was incredibly small, be aware all the single rooms they have are this big, and it is not worth the money: i complained to the reception desk, telling then that it was just not acceptable for a four star hotel and for the rate i was paying, they promised me that the following nigt they could arrange a double room paying an extra fee, which i accepted it anyway i told them to transmit my concerns about the room to the management and i din´t received a response during the for nights i have stayed there so in terms of customer care i give this hotel a 0.[SEP]breakfast is one of the worst i have had in a four star hotel, the selection of hot food is very limited and inedible, orange juice is very bad, and the pastrys are rockhard, unfortunaley because the hotel is in the midle of nowhere (if you don´t have a car you wiil spend a fortune in taxis) this is your only choice for breakfast.[SEP]tv´s are nice flat screen but the picture quality is very poor.[SEP]they have a nice coffe lounge, but don´t expect the waiters to come to ask you if you want to drink something, youi have to chase the, unacceptable for a four star hote.[SEP]there a lot of better choices in madrid specially in terms of location and customer care-.
0	having had a friendly telephone conversation with a member of the reservations staff to book my stay, i was looking forward to my first visit to opus.[SEP]the hotel's location is convenient to explore the city but the building is situated on a busy cross - roads with constant traffic heard throughout the building.[SEP]the first suite i was shown to did not have a bath as requested and i was moved to a small standard room overlooking the courtyard.[SEP]luckily it was a monday, the receptionist did not recommend rooms overlooking the courtyard from thursday to sunday due to the late night party in the bar below.[SEP]i stayed in the room for 3 nights before moving to a suite with a bath which i had originally booked.[SEP]the room was spacious but painted a lurid orange and overlooked a side street littered with refuse.[SEP]the room was badly lit and had no privacy from onlookers.[SEP]a majority of the staff were very unfriendly and two receptionists in particular were extremely inefficient in carrying out simple guest requests.[SEP]the highlight of this hotel were the porters / bell boys who always had a smile of their faces, nothing was to much trouble for them.[SEP]shame about the others.[SEP]a real disappointment.
0	typically stay at this hampton inn when the rates are reasonable (especially compared to other hotels in the city) ; however, this is my last time staying here.[SEP]the property, rooms and typical hampton qualities were all fine.[SEP]nothing to write home about but comfort level was there... the location and service made me not want to return.[SEP]this hotel is adjacent to boston medical center... i'm not sure if it is a busy season or what but the ambulance / police / fire sirens are non - stop... all through the night / morning.[SEP]if you need a 5 am alarm... stay here.[SEP]typically i request a high floor but my arrival wasn't until 11 pm and i received a room on the 3rd floor... terrible.[SEP]additionally, the wireless internet wasn't working.[SEP]when i called to ask if they would reset the router they said that it was my computer issue.[SEP]next, some random man knocked on my door without my request and offered to help against my protest.[SEP]his suggestion was to restart the computer (thanks, because i didn't already try that).[SEP]when that didn't work he gave me a number to call... so i can sit on hold and talk to your service tech.[SEP]no, thanks.[SEP]never again...
0	embassy suites seem to be a " hit or miss " property.[SEP]some are outstanding, but this one left us wanting more.[SEP]upon check - in the staff was rushed and rude.[SEP]when we entered our room, it was the standard embassy suites set - up.[SEP]a liiving room with couch and table, a wet bar and separate bedroom.[SEP]it was fairly clean, except for the red stain on the ceiling.[SEP]i'm not really sure what it was, and frankly, i don't want to know.[SEP]i reported the stain to the front desk and they wrote down our room number.[SEP]nothing much was said about it.[SEP]the nice perk of staying at the embassy suites is the " manager's reception " that includes appetizers (nachos and popcorn) and complimentary cocktails.[SEP]it is only offered during certain times each night.[SEP]the bartender at this property was wonderful and i wish i had written down her name to give her kuddos![SEP]the complimentary cooked to order breakfast was excellent![SEP]everything was fresh and the food was fairly tasty.[SEP]the location of this property is in a questionable area.[SEP]it probably isn't the safest place to be outside of at night.[SEP]it is a pretty quick taxi ride to the strip.[SEP]it was around $5 or $6.
0	i stayed here for a meeting in september 07.[SEP]the location was a little out of the way for a true " downtown " location.[SEP]the shuttle services at the seattle airport do not stop at this location so i was forced to take a ride into " downtown " and then hire a cab to finish the journey.[SEP]the hotel does have a shuttle that brings you to town about twice an hour.[SEP]it is an adequate service and needed for this out of the way location.[SEP]due to the time change my flight arrived pretty early in the day.[SEP]when booking i had requested a room to be ready by 10 am so that i would be able to freshen up prior to my meeting.[SEP]i understand that this is an extra special request for a property at this level.[SEP]the front desk staff was quite accomodating upon my arrival, noted my request, and found an available room within ten minutes.[SEP]imagine my suprise when i found some underwear, used toothpaste, soap, and shampoo still residing in the bathroom that was supposedly ready for my stay.[SEP]the front desk seemed concerned and quickly arranged to send me to another room.[SEP]overall it is just an average property.[SEP]i think that there may be a better value for the dollar within a few blocks of this hotel.
0	our first stay at this magnificient hotel.[SEP]the location leaves something to be desired, but they routinely bus you downtown.[SEP]that being said, this hotel is wonderful in every respect![SEP]first, and foremost, the staff is exceptional, well trained and professional.[SEP]the spa is great, the executive lounge the best i've seen and i am a regular with hilton.[SEP]my sons and their wives (late twenties, early thirties) loved it every bit as much and the only other downside is that it is so relaxing that you may be tempted to spend more time at the hotel than you were planning.[SEP]we stayed at the hilton stucky in venice and the difference between these two hotels is night and day.
0	a grande hotel of classic service standards and some of the highest prices in paris.[SEP]service is outstanding and the hotel staff seem genuinely pleased to interpret your need in advance of your knowing you have a need.[SEP]in particular the concierge staff is outstanding and was able at the last moment to secure the most difficult reservations.[SEP]although convenient to the metro, the location is dissapointing being on a street with heavy louvre directed tourist traffic and shops that supply tourist trinkets.[SEP]because of the service, an experience not to miss but other parisian hotels offer comparable service in a better location at no higher prices.
0	i can not say enough good things about the people that work at the ritz.[SEP]every person from the hotel that we came into contact with was polite, well spoken, helpful and were genuine, it was not lip service, all employees were great.[SEP]the hotel is very nice, very fancy, beds were ok.[SEP]the beach was not nice, nor was the location, its kind of junky around the hotel, feels like myrtle beach or va.[SEP]beach but the hotel itself is an oasis.[SEP]food was very good but extremely expensive.[SEP]resturant across the street next to the cock fight arena (yes, i m serious) was suprisingly great local food.[SEP]if you can, leave the hotel and find a nice deserted beach or rainforrest to feel like you are really on vactation.[SEP]overall, a pleasant stay.[SEP]the lobby bar.....[SEP]see jose, great fellow
0	the elevator does not go to all levels.[SEP]we had to carry our suit cases up the stairs.[SEP]it was quite noisy in the hotel after midnight when all the youngsters returned from their outings.[SEP]pillows were not at all comfortable (very synthetic).[SEP]we were mislead by the description " boutique hotel ".[SEP]it was far too expensive for what was offered.[SEP]the receptionists were very helpful.[SEP]the double room was quite small for 2 but clean.[SEP]we did not like the location at all.[SEP]we might have liked it if we were younger!!!
0	i would consider this hotel a 2 star for several reasons.[SEP]the biggest problem i had with this hotel is the the water from the bathroom sink was not potable.[SEP]there were signs stuck to the bathroom mirror that said not the drink the water.[SEP]the other problem was the location of this hotel, right across from termini with all of the problems that ensue being right next to a major train station.[SEP]this is my 4th trip in 4 years to rome, first and last time at the madison.
0	do not stay here![SEP]they messed up our booking and they were completley incompetent in resolving the matter.[SEP]we were forced to stay at another location and were out of pocket by hundreds of euros.[SEP]at the same time as we were checking in, another customer was complaining because they had misplaced her passport, and she had to report it missing to the police.[SEP]they have completley inconvenienced us and made us waste time we could have otherwise spent exploring barcelona.[SEP]if you expect good customer service, do not stay here.
0	stayed 3 nights at the intercontinental in dec 2011.[SEP]overall a decent stay but probably would not stay here again.[SEP]the good: - clean high end building with nice furniture.[SEP]modern and elegant.[SEP]- generally friendly staff.[SEP]the bad: - location is not great.[SEP]its only 2 blocks away from the powell street bart but those 2 blocks are not the greatest.[SEP]definitely wouldn't walk further down the street as there are street people and shady looking characters.[SEP]would prefer to stay closer to union square next time.[SEP]the ugly: the hotel seems to nickel and dime you at every corner.[SEP]- no complimentary wi - fi- maybe i'm being a bit harsh here but come on![SEP]this is a basic amenity in most hotels and should be standard.[SEP]- parking is available but only valet at roughly $60 for 24 hours.[SEP]there is a parkade next door which offers parking for $32 for 24 hours.[SEP]overall, we had a good stay but the next time we visit san fran, we will not stay here.
0	while the i would rate the hotel itself wonderful i would not rate the location good at all if you are looking to be in a touristy section of boston.[SEP]we quickly realized upon entering the area that this was mainly designated for people attending the nearby convention center or some sort of business conference at the hotel itself.[SEP]i am detailing this in hopes this might help those planning a trip to boston that might be looking for something that is more centrally located to touristy attractions, if that is what you are looking for then this hotel is definitely not it.[SEP]nothing is really in walking distance unless you are going to the aquariam, luckily we brought our car so we drove everywhere which wasn't as horrible as maybe nyc but still could be a slight pain when looking for parking.[SEP]i would recommend back bay or copley square areas which are jumping with lots of shopping and restaurants and cafes.[SEP]the hotel itself is very nice but if you are looking for a nearby restaurant you aren't going to find it!
0	the hotel was great all round and service was very good.[SEP]the hotel staff were there to advise you about good restaurants and places to see etc.[SEP]the spa was great too, the steam room and sauna was great to relax - and the opening hours are til 10 pm which gave us enough time too.[SEP]the location of the hotel was a little further out than i would have preferred.[SEP]but the metro station was on your doorstep so was easy to get around barcelona.[SEP]we were dissapointed with the restaurant in the hotel.[SEP]the view from the top was great and the wine was very nice however the food for a 5 star restaurant was dissapointing.[SEP]we were advised they would cater for vegetarians but when we asked there was not much choice and furthermore there not much effort in trying to accomodate which was unfortunate for a 5 star restaurant.[SEP]the food overall was nt very good, and the mains were served cold.[SEP]the dessert was amazing and on the house as they had not provided the best service, but on another trip to barcelona i would not go again.[SEP]very very overpriced for an ok meal... apart from that - it was a great holiday..!
0	all i have to say is that this place was awful.[SEP]the room smelt of damp, the sofa bed (my boy was meant to be sleeping on) was ripped and heavily stained.[SEP]floor and walls were filthy, skirting boards falling away from the walls.[SEP]the whole building and location looks very tired and worn.[SEP]the area is not very pleasant walking back from tube station which is a good 10 mins walk at night!
0	we spent one night in early oct.[SEP]prior to departure to victoria.[SEP]this is a stunning hotel - beautiful asian - contemporary decor with flat screen tv and whirlpool bath that opens to bedroom area.[SEP]service was excellent - we had a luggage problem that staff was very helpful with, and we enjoyed sushi and drinks at marazul.[SEP]we weren't thrilled with the location.[SEP]it was a 10 - 15 minute walk downtown and although there is a lot of construction in the area, it was pretty deserted after dark.[SEP]this looks like an area that will be full of hotels, condos, restaurants, and people in a few years, but it isn't there yet.
0	the carlyle is one of a quickly vanishing breed... a hotel which lives up to its reputation for high quality service, accommodations, and ambiance.[SEP]from the moment you step into the lobby, you know this is not the marriott marquis or the " w ".[SEP]from the marble floors to the art to the impeccable service, it is first class.[SEP]the' superior suite' was just that with large living room and large bedroom.[SEP]the bathroom, although very modern and totally mirrored, was miniscule even by ny standards.[SEP]the decor in the carlyle gallery (restaurant) is moorish and lovely, not over the top like a lot of' bogart - wanna - be's.[SEP]serving lighter fare, the gallery is the better place to eat at the carlyle.[SEP]the main restaurant's decor is also marvelous ; however, the seating is crowded and there is no way to not be involved in the conversation next to you.[SEP]the food is fairly over - priced and not that good.[SEP]location, location, location..[SEP]that is the major problem.[SEP]unless you plan to go to central park and that is it, brace yourself for lots of taxi expense and long travel time to the theaters.[SEP]this is not a hotel for a taste of broadway.
0	my husband and i travelled with my parents to rome for a long weekend.[SEP]we chose this hotel due to it's location.[SEP]the hotel is 5 minutes walk from the vatican and st marks sq.[SEP]all other sights are within walking distance.[SEP]the staff were all very helpful and offered advice on resturants to eat in the evening and places to visit.[SEP]breakfast was ok, they offered tea, coffee and a continental breakfast offering pastries, cold meats and cheese, with toasts and yoghurts.[SEP]the rooms are small and quite dark due to the decoration in the rooms.[SEP]both our room and my parents smelt of stale water and the bathrooms were not as expected.[SEP]the whirlpool baths look great but after my parents using theirs on the first night and it leaving a grey sludge film around the bath (whilst my father was in it.... he is not that dirty!!) the filters were obviously not run through and cleaned properly.[SEP]the water was never hot, in the three days i never had a hot bath or shower - this was the same for my parents.[SEP]the road is very noisy and the windows are not built to block this noise out, i would have expected double glazing in the centre of rome - unfortunately this was not the case.[SEP]in all the staff and location were fabulous and i praise them highly, however i would not recommend this hotel as a comfortable nights stay and i would suggest this is more of a 3 * that a 4 * as it states.
0	just returned from a 4 night stay at the mandalay bay, had a great time.[SEP]long waits for the elevator, but this was understandable as the hotel was hosting an awards show, which 8000 people were attending![SEP]i was on holiday in vegas and not about to let the small stuff bother me:) the location was a little out the way as i normally stay at the mirage which is in the middle of all the action but just got taxis when i needed to go out anywhere.[SEP]the staff and customer service were fantastic, i'd missed my connection and the mandalay bay sent a another limo for the new flight time which was great.[SEP](i had a limo already booked with them) got upgraded to a 750 suite strip view suite on check in, which was nice and spacious as i was travelling with my mother.[SEP]loved the huge bathroom!![SEP]went to mix lounge one evening, wow what a amazing view of the strip!![SEP]the staff at vip services need to get a shout out for the fantastic service we received, would definitely stay there again.
0	our hotel room was very clean and modern, quite thin but very long.[SEP]didn't contain a bath - would advise against booking if you prefer using a bath.[SEP]staff were polite and happy to assist and the free wifi in the reception is brilliant, a perfect place to relax.[SEP]the real downside to this hotel is the location.[SEP]it is perfect if you are using the atocha train station, but beyond that it's not very helpful.[SEP]even the metro station is a good walk from the hotel.[SEP]we got in at 9 pm (on a friday) to discover the restaurant was closed, and almost all the other restaurants in a five - six block area were shut as well.[SEP]for business trips or outside the summer period i imagine it's a really useful hotel, but we didn't see it on show on this occasion.
0	i chose this hotel after nights of searching for a good location, that was not too expensive.[SEP]i was seriously dissapointed by the location (directly opposite a very busy motorway).[SEP]we had to get taxis everytime we wanted to leave the hotel (which was everyday and night).[SEP]the hotel actually shares its pool with another hotel and is in need of some serious work![SEP]it looks nothing like the lovely pool photos that the hotel shows.[SEP]and do not use the tour desk (sun city) located in the lobby to book any tours.[SEP]you have been warned![SEP]all in all, the hotel was reasonably priced, however i would have paid more to stay in a better hotel if i knew what it was really going to be like.
0	we were there for 2 weeks on theatre tour from canada.[SEP]it was incredibly noisy, small rooms / bathrooms and the only thing going for it, was the location.[SEP]i would rather pay more money and stay at a quieter, downtown location.[SEP]we got moved to another room on the other side of the hotel and it didn't make any difference to the noise level and the condition of the room was more run down after the move.[SEP]the elevators were incredibly slow, not an option to take the stairs on the 9th floor.[SEP]would only stay here if staying 1 or 2 nights and couldn't afford to upgrade to better hotel.
0	if you ever visited the pulitzer in barcelona, this pulitzer is a real joke.[SEP]the staff isn't friendly neither helpful.[SEP]the reception staff isn't helping.[SEP]when checking out they started talking to each other in stead of helping me.[SEP]no thank you, no goodbye.[SEP]i still had some questions, but they didn't have any interest.[SEP]in the breakfast area you need to ask for everything.[SEP]the staff doesn't add anything to the buffet.[SEP]the location is far from the city center.[SEP]the metro doesn't run late, so you need to take a taxi (appr.[SEP]€ 15,00).[SEP]the rooms aren't as pretty as on the website, neither as the ones from the pulitzer in barcelona.[SEP]they aren't cleaned well either.[SEP]i certainly won't stay again there next time.[SEP]and no wonder gr group is selling this hotel, it doesn't do any good to the pulitzer name.
0	we booked this hotel because of the good reviews we saw on this website, but it turned out to be a big disappointment.[SEP]first of all, the room and the bathroom are very small, and i can't believe there is no shower curtain in such a small bathroom.[SEP]it's very hard not to make a mess, so the floor is always wet in the morning.[SEP]also, there is no mirror in the room, and the shelf in the bathroom is small.[SEP]it's very hard to wear makeup or dress up.[SEP]secondly, we couldn't sleep well.[SEP]there is a police office nearby, and the noise continued until midnight.[SEP]the bedding is also bad.[SEP]my pillow is uneven -- one side higher and stiffer than the other.[SEP]there is even a pink stain on the sheet.[SEP]the location is apparently bad.[SEP]since it's not our first time traveling to paris, we didn't mind spending more time on transportation if the hotel is good.[SEP]but we were very disappointed![SEP]etap is as far from the city center, but much cheaper![SEP]although the service was very nice, we will never stay in this hotel again.[SEP]we rather spend € 30 to € 50 more per night to stay in the city center, or choose etap.
0	stayed here over the weekend.[SEP]i never heard of this hotel, but since all the major hotels in napa were booked i decided to take a chance on it.[SEP]i now regret my decision.[SEP]i can not fathom anyone who has stayed in a decent hotel giving vino bello a positive review.[SEP]first of all, the hotel is way overpriced - charging $230/night.[SEP]you'd get a better deal at the marriott, embassy suites, or hilton at a lower price.[SEP]the $15/day resort fee is a total scam.[SEP]this is in additional to the daily rate.[SEP]the location is in a corporate park located far from the vineyards.[SEP]the rooms are dated and damaged - dents in walls and doors.[SEP]breakfast is not included, unlike most other napa hotels.[SEP]the only reason i see staying here is if you are a time - share member.[SEP]otherwise avoid like the plague.[SEP]there are far better and cheaper options available.
0	beside the location (far from the strips) and service (waited 3 hours for my room), everything is good.[SEP]the room is huge and clean.[SEP]parking is free.[SEP]their casino is kind of crappy but i am not gambling anyway.[SEP]for $10 dollar a night, it worth everything penny.
0	avg.[SEP]rooms, only to come back and sleep..[SEP]if you are on a tight budget and out for shopping and sightseeing all day only to come back and sleep/ shower in the room..[SEP]then it might be ok..[SEP]rooms are very very avg., location is ok.
0	my husband and i spent 3 days in singapore and in effort to keep costs low (it's singapore after all!) we chose this hotel.[SEP]we're still happy about the price... but that's about it.[SEP]pro's: slept like a baby as the room had great a / c, the view from the room was lovely and the pool was nice.[SEP]con's: truly awful service... overcrowded restaurant, they didn't clean our room the first day we had to call them, expensive internet, location is out of the way - taxi's are required.[SEP]is it too much to ask to hire people who are customer service oriented in the hotel industry?![SEP]spend a little extra and stay close to the downtown area (perhaps the swisshotel).
0	read this with the understanding that i am a huge fan of embassy suites, just not this one.[SEP]rooms are adequate and relatively clean.[SEP]breakfast was so so.[SEP]kids did not like the food.[SEP]omelet station layout is inadequate.[SEP]no alcohol at manager's reception - so did not bother - snacks at these things are usually pretty poor.[SEP]there is a charge for internet service.[SEP]i have not had to pay for internet service at other embassy hotels.[SEP]location is inconvenient if you are going into the city.[SEP]you must walk through a park and soccer field to get to the t station.[SEP]you can cut straight through if no one is playing, otherwise walk around.[SEP]finally, parking is extremely expensive given the location.[SEP]the valet was also nice enough to steal all of the change needed for the tolls.[SEP]for the next trip, i will stay in quincy or braintree if driving.[SEP]hotels are less expensive, parking is free, and commute time is about the same.
0	the hotels location is within a good distance to the rai, but if you are planning on going to central amsterdam then this hotel is a bit to far out of town, you can walk there but, takes about an hour and a half.[SEP]upon arriving at the flipper (mid saturday afternoon), we were confronted with a locked front door and had to be interrogated through an intercom, before we were aloud inside.[SEP]inside we had to pay in cash due to the 5% charge if you pay by card.[SEP]we also had to pay a further â‚¬20 deposit for a card to hold up at the window each time you come back to the hotel, to skip the interrogation process.[SEP]we had reserved a twin room with a shared bathroom, which was up two incredibly steep flights of stairs.[SEP]the actual room was ridiculously small in size, more like a cupboard, the room had a sink on the wall which took 10 minutes to drain and also leaked.[SEP]the shared bathroom was right next door to our room, but it was again ridiculously small in size, was very dimly lit, and the shower head had nowhere to fix it onto the wall.[SEP]the staff were friendly and helpful, and the breakfast was nice.[SEP]the room cost us â‚¬195 for two nights which is absolute robbery for the quality of this hostel, i mean hotel.
0	i stayed at the marriot for 3 nights and the hotel i could nt fault.[SEP]it had a great pool, good choice of restaurants and spacious high quality rooms.[SEP]the hotel is much grander than most marriot's i have stayed in within the uk.[SEP]i would recommend this hotel to anyone who hires a car in la but even though downtown has meant to have shifted its negative image i would not stay here if you have not got transport.[SEP]the neighbourhood is not safe to walk about at night and nobody walks in la anyway![SEP]i would recommend anyone who wants a great location to wander on foot rather than drive to stay in the santa monica area - more expensive but well worth it.
0	good points: the room was clean and quiet, which is important ; the staff was nice ; the two pools were excellent.[SEP]bad points: bad location: hole in bedspread the size of a baseball ; no travel consultants, and only one or two brochures in lobby ; staff was not good at arranging tours ; breakfast was poor.[SEP]on the first day, toast was served with little packs of butter and jelly, but two of the jelly packs had mold.[SEP]the second day, i wanted pastries, but they were out.[SEP]the third day, i drove a mile down the road for pastries.[SEP]we ate dinner twice in the restaurant, and the meals were very good both times.[SEP]the first day, we had towels but no wash cloths.[SEP]we had to call twice before we got any.[SEP]the third day, no towels or wash cloths.[SEP]after the first call, we got towels but no wash cloths ; we made two more requests and never got the wash cloths.
0	i stayed at this hotel when visiting rome over christmas 2005.[SEP]i was a little concerned when my airport taxi driver couldn't find the hotel for a considerable time.[SEP]it turned out that the hotel was situated in a dead - end residential street some distace from the city centre.[SEP]the hotel itself was very modern & clean, my single room was functional and housekeeping kept it spotless all week.[SEP]the room had a mini - bar fridge and a tv with no channels in english.[SEP]the bed was comfortable, and there was no traffic disturbance at night due to the remote location.[SEP]disappointingly, the breakfast seemed to consist only of pastries and fruit juice and there was no facility for lunch / dinner unless i ventured into the city or walked some distance to local restaurants.[SEP]this isn't recommended (especially at night) as the dirty residential streets are something of a minefield of dog poop.[SEP]the lack of any hot food was a particular problem over the christmas period when - unlike in the uk and us - everything seemed to be closed.[SEP]the hotel provides an excellent mini - bus service to the city and back several times daily, with a very amusing driver, but this has to be pre - booked and is often full.[SEP]the hotel does what it says on the tin, and does nt try to rip you off.[SEP]if i hadn't had some upsetting family news from england during my stay, and been desperate to get home, i guess i would have enjoyed my stay here a lot more.
0	beware- the posts that say this hotel is in a great location are referring only to its proximity to the train station.[SEP]it is not a safe area.[SEP]in fact, if you walk down the street either way, you're met with armed guards and tanks outside the international embassies.[SEP]the area is overall dirty and is not at all near any of the sites of rome.[SEP]unless you are only staying one night, must be near the train station, are n’t worried about safety or cleanliness, you will regret booking this hotel.
0	this hotel was rather nice i must say![SEP]the location for starters was a bit... crap i sopose.[SEP]the area is basicly warehouses and not so nice flats... bt then we got into the hotel and it was very good.[SEP]its pretty modern (90's) and the rooms were very big, if very brigtly coulered.[SEP]we got a very good view from our room (onto the hills were there was a forest fire when we looked....) and the minibar was free with drinks to keep you happy.[SEP]breakfast was good, has an excellent choice of cold buffet but not much hot stuff, and bein british i do love a good cooked breakfast but there was enough to keep me going.[SEP]as for getting into town, the metro is literly a minute away on line 4, and was about 3 stops from the city centre.[SEP]personally i did nt have any trouble on the metro... maybe cause i'm 6ft3 they keep out my way?[SEP]i dunno but its safe enough.[SEP]so overall good hotel and deffently consider staying here again
0	this was our first stay at the riv.[SEP]i picked it for its price.[SEP]i asked for the " new " monaco tower, because of the comments i read on this site.[SEP]the rooms (we had two) were reasonably clean and large, and the mattress was not too soft.[SEP]but the paint was peeling in many places in the room.[SEP]the cabinet door was only attached by one hinge.[SEP]and there is no coffee maker in the room.[SEP]i called housekeeping but they don't have any either.[SEP]like others said its location is too far from the other attractions.[SEP]i would not stay here again.
0	i find it aboslutely bizzare to see recent reviews calling this hotel tired and old.[SEP]i arrived at the hotel on a friday night and was shocked about how much had changed from my last visit here a few years ago.[SEP]i lined up with my dad to get him checked in and 15 minutes later we were heading through the newly remodeled casino toward our elevator.[SEP]the elevator banks, to the hallways, to the rooms all looked brand new.[SEP]new flat screen tv's, tripple sheeting, granite counter tops......[SEP]definety not worn or run down.[SEP]really pleased with the changes they made.[SEP]they ca nt do anything about the location, but the trade off in value makes this hotel worth it in my book.
0	my wife joined me here for a conference.[SEP]conference amenities were very good.[SEP]room service was very good.[SEP]the dinner buffet was horrible.[SEP]the cafe was decent for lunch.[SEP]the mexican restaurant food was pretty good but margaritas were lame (with a coupon).[SEP]the service at the steakhouse was below average but the meal was overall very good with an excellent steak.[SEP]they tout their bowling alley which is huge but it is open for leagues only in the evening.[SEP]the pool area was very nice but it was too cold to swim while we were there.[SEP]the spa was not hot enough to enjoy.[SEP]i don't game but my wife enjoys blackjack.[SEP]she didn't have any luck.[SEP]the biggest drawback to south point is their location.[SEP]we didn't have a car and they do not provide a shuttle.[SEP]cabs are pricey and the public transportation inconvenient.[SEP]being stuck at this place in the boonies is a deal breaker for us.[SEP]we would consider staying there again if they had a shuttle, even if they charged a nominal fee.
0	if you are not familiar with italian " customer service " please read up on the different standards for hotel staff for us vs italy.[SEP]we have traveled to many european countries over the past 20 years so we are not newbies.[SEP]for the hotel baileys do not expect anything more on the service side other than a chilly reception (for americans?).[SEP]we are not ethno - centric typical american tourists but it seems like everyone hates us right now due to our political stance in the world, and the staff at the hotel baileys are no different.[SEP]we had hoped for more for our 1st wedding anniversary but the staff were straining to be minimally friendly.[SEP]they were not busy during our stay in sep - oct 06 yet did not do anything for our prearranged anniversary date not even a flower in our room, much less a bottle of wine or prosecco.[SEP]the room was good for rome standards at this price - very clean but small.[SEP]breakfast room, food and service staff were the bright point of our visit location is not as close to the train station as the hotel website suggests, and make sure you are comfortable exploring on your own before trying to get there without a very very precise map after normal business hours.[SEP]having said that, we love walking around (even with luggage) and this is a decent neighborhood.
0	for a short stay in rome i though the executive will be a good, low cost option.[SEP]this hotel is supposed to be 4 stars could be barely 2.[SEP]the staff is polite but not friendly, our room 404 was horrible with empty snaks under the beds (none cleans under the beds?), stains on the curtains and the carpet.[SEP]very dark, not enough light, no mirrors and even not a simple decoration![SEP]just poor![SEP]no curtain on the shower so all the bathroom becomes a swimming pool... the breakfast is very basic and location - not the best... about 15 mins walk from via veneto.[SEP]no shops or restaurants nearby.[SEP]free wi - fi only in the lobby.
0	i am sorry to say that this was not a nice stay.[SEP]i had to change rooms because of noise, but it didn't matter.[SEP]apparently the rooms have no insulation.[SEP]the breakfast is meager at best.[SEP]the coffee weak.[SEP]the staff is ok.[SEP]internet slow.[SEP]the location is poor, not near anything of quality.[SEP]my suggestion: stay at the staybridge in chatsworth.
0	dirty dumpy but cheap room was dingy.... peeling wall paper, carpet was a remnant that had gaps around the edge.[SEP]furnishings were uncomfortable in the extreme and cheap.[SEP]bathroom was moldy, fan was broke.[SEP]breakfast buffet was as cheap as you could put one on.[SEP]noisy next to bar.[SEP]lots of homeless folks sleeping in doorways all around the hotel every night added a bit of local color.[SEP]otherwise location is convenient for td banknorth center and north station.[SEP]note.... some rooms in this place had been renovated and were nice, but mine was dump.all in all, i should have spent $30 more and stayed in a less run down location.
0	not friendly staff, seemed annoyed at any communication with them.[SEP]the room was dirty and the sheets were stiff and itchy.[SEP]the room smelled old and yucky.[SEP]bathroom floor was visibly dirty.[SEP]location was not that great and we paid way too much to stay there.[SEP]we also stayed at the regina hotel at the top of las ramblas and it was way nicer and a better price!
0	we stayed in this hotel at the beginning of september 2010 for a few days in san fran.[SEP]the location is fair.[SEP]its close to shops, restaurants (although san frans choice is not the best), the famous tram system just 100 m away.[SEP]our room was a little cramped, but it was clean and business desk with network and usb charge points was handy.[SEP]the staff were very helpful and friendly.[SEP]all the main car rental offices within 5mins walk.[SEP]two minor compliants: taxis do nt stop regularly here, and you have to hail one some way from the hotel or the hotel have an arrangement with a' chauffered car hire' company which had rates as good as most taxis.[SEP]the second complaint is not aimed at the hotel, but this location is within a short walk to the tenderloin area and the homeless problem is very pronounced in sf (more than any european city i have been in and far worse than la) and several homeless stray around.[SEP]the hotel was very evident in maintaining the safety and security of its lobby and customers.[SEP]there are many hotels closer to the more susceptable areas but do nt be surpirsed to come across these people on a daily basis.
0	the marriott rive gauche hotel & conference center is a large american style hotel only a half dozen or so metro stops away from the major tourist sites.[SEP]during a nearly month long road trip of europe i checked in and out of many hotels.[SEP]while it was great to experience the culture of the places i visited, the rive gauche turned out to be a welcome escape from the traditional european hotel scene.[SEP]the rive gauche basically has all the amenities that one can expect from marriott in the states.[SEP]the hotel is exceptionally clean and the hotel rooms appear to be recently updated.[SEP]the beds were particularly comfortable.[SEP]the bathroom is actually two separate rooms – one for the toilet and one for the sink and shower.[SEP]even though the hotel is a one minute walk to the nearest metro station, the location may not be ideal for some travelers.[SEP]the hotel is in a residential section of paris well outside of the city center.[SEP]if you need to be in the middle of the action this hotel may not be for you.[SEP]if you can tolerate a short commute on public transportation this hotel may be the perfect match.
0	great hotel could not best location young travelers, chicago, il usamy girlfriend and i stayed at hotel ateneo in march during a two week trip to europe.[SEP]we selected the hotel based on price and location.[SEP]we felt the rate was reasonable and location farily centralized, but upon arriving were a little nervous about the street that we were on.[SEP]apparently, this street is commonly known as a place where hookers hang out / work.[SEP]so when we returned to the hotel after dinner and drinks we felt it's surroundings were a little sketchy late at night.[SEP]  other negative was that they double charged my girlfriend and i.[SEP]the room was reserved with her credit card and the next morning when checking out we paid with mine.[SEP]hopefully they mistakenly decided to charge both of us for a one night stay.[SEP]we didn't discover this until we were going through our card statements back home.[SEP]wasn't happy about that.[SEP]  besides the surroundings and billing issue we felt the hotel was clean and modern.[SEP]big plus was free internet access in the business center.[SEP]if you looking for mid - range pricing, clean, and central it's not too bad.
0	we stayed for 4 nights at the start of sept.[SEP]we had to change rooms as the air con was so noisy- even after asking for a quiet room as i am 6 months pregnant.[SEP]we did get a quieter room (but the air con was still an audible sound in the room) many of the floors are being renovated, which i was not aware of when we booked intially.[SEP]i guess this is why both rooms had views overlooking a central courtyard rather than out onto madison avenue.[SEP]breakfast was v basic, so we went out for it.[SEP]the roof terrace is being used as the dinning area for breakfast whilst they do the renovations.[SEP]rooms were very small- but it is nyc![SEP]our room was cleaned very day and cleanliness was not an issue.[SEP]on balance, i prob would not stay there again, but location was great and the little contact we did have with staff was perfectly fine.
0	we stayed at this hotel as part of a tour in october / november.[SEP]we stayed here on our last night before we flew out of rome.[SEP]the location is not close to any of the sites.[SEP]our tour group stayed on the same floor (it was either the 2nd or 3rd floor).[SEP]walking down the hall, there was missing wallpaper and it was obvious that there had been a leak.[SEP]in our room, there was quite a bit of mould around the vent, so we made sure not to turn the vent on.[SEP]others in our tour said that they had mould too.[SEP]we had 3 single beds in our room.[SEP]the room was small, but we expected this for europe.[SEP]the beds were comfortable.[SEP]the staff didn't really go out of their way to do anything memorable for us (they wouldn't make a coffee for us to take to the airport, as we were leaving at about 6 am, even though our cab driver saw the man at the front desk get himself a coffee!).[SEP]they did call us a cab though.[SEP]it costs 50 euros to get to the airport.[SEP]we would not stay here again, as it isn't even really that close to the airport.
0	disappointed not to have a more sociable time we stayed at the cabanas for two nights at the end of our hawaii holiday.[SEP]we'd already had a couple of nights at the aqua aloha surf hotel where our room was unexpectedly smart and with excellent views across the city.[SEP]in contrast, the room at the cabanas was dark and rather gloomy, with nothing in the way of a view.[SEP]staff were friendly enough and helpfully arranged an early check - in for us.[SEP]however we didn't meet any other guests during our stay and we were the only two people who showed up for the drinks party on thursday evening.[SEP]the shared areas of the cabanas are not conducive to socialising and we didn't even consider using the hot tub - it simply wasn't in a nice enough setting.[SEP]overall, we rather regretted moving from the other location.
0	when i booked this trip, i knew the stratosphere was one of the older hotels and i expected to find it slightly outdated and possibly even shabby in a of couple ways ; what i am trying to say is that i had modest expectations given the age, location, and price of the hotel.[SEP]what i did not expect was a hotel room that looked more like it belonged in a flea bag freeway motel rather than on the las vegas strip.[SEP]there were no pictures / art on the wall, but plenty of nail holes, the ceiling in the bathroom was stained with rust, the sink was mega old school and not mounted to a cabinet unit but rather freely to the wall with a tiny, tiny shelf next to it for your things which did not even fit a normal sized cosmetics bag let alone three as there were three of us travelling, the sink was loose from the wall, the walls were paper thin and we could hear everything above, below and beside, and, to top it all off, the room smelled like an ashtray even though there was a' non - smoking' placard on the door.[SEP]even the smoker in our group was put off by the smell.[SEP]it was one of our group's first time to vegas and i was so embarassed having been the one who picked the hotel.[SEP]considering the cost of the taxi cabs to get to the rest of the strip, any other strip hotel would have been better and probably ended up being cheaper!
0	stayed at days hotel, 14 to 17 april 09, inclusive, allocated there by jetlinecruises.com.[SEP]after a six day atlantic crossing on queen mary 2 (which was fabulous).[SEP]days hotel has probably had better' days'.[SEP]room was dark and tired.[SEP]however, bed linen and bathroom towels were spotless.[SEP]located upper west side of new york.[SEP]had we known better would have asked for a hotel more central.[SEP]the extra cost of somewhere more central would have been have been covered by what we paid out in taxi fares to and from hotel.[SEP]for anyone on a very tight buget the hotel would probably be ok.[SEP]on two positive points there is a great dinner,' new key west', just around the corner.[SEP]had breakfast and late dinner there both nights.[SEP]much cheaper than eating in central new york.[SEP]the quality and quantity of food was excellent.[SEP]the staff had a good laugh as we struggled with the quantity.[SEP]the other good point was that central park was within walking distance.[SEP]this was our first visit to new york and we had a great time, but would have chosen a better hotel, if it had not been for the hotel being part of a package.[SEP]jetline could have done a better job with their explanation of the hotel and its location.[SEP]pete & catherine.
0	good value, good but not great location.[SEP]get the new widescreen view room.[SEP]house keeping good,.staff very friendly.[SEP]casino just ok, but did not go for the casino.[SEP]food was ok, not great, not bad, just ok.[SEP]tram to luxor and bay was very good.[SEP]new york new york next door gave something different to do when tired of excalabur.[SEP]all in all i would recoomed this hotel for someone with either kids or looking for good value.
0	location: middle of nowhere room: good room service: arrived on time but food looked so unappealing.[SEP]not worth the price.[SEP]especially paying sgd8++ for a small glass of milkshake.[SEP]there are better places for similar price.[SEP]best avoid
0	we stayed in the " manor rooms " which were located across the road from the main hotel.[SEP]they were the cheapest and evidently there was a reason for this.[SEP]was about a 10 - 15 minute walk from the front entrance of the hotel, ending with having to leave the lovely air conditioned hotel to treck across a car park to the motel - esque buildings.[SEP]room was ok, not the cleanest or in the best condition.[SEP]safe had no door on it.[SEP]was large with two double beds just a bit worn out.[SEP]hotel was not in the best location the two hotels which were next to it along the strip were closed and being rebuilt when we were there so was about 20 minute walk to any attraction in one direction and about 15 minutes to the strasphere in the other direction.[SEP]might be better if had a mode of transport other than feet.[SEP]was very reasonable and it became evident you get what you pay for.[SEP]some ok places to eat and lots of shops, facilities were plentiful.[SEP]pool was nice, good little cash machine looking machines which provided internet access.[SEP]serivce not the best but given the size was inevitabley inpersonal.[SEP]would reccommend if the budget is tight but otherwise would try for somewhere further along the strip.[SEP]was very much a fun artificial feeling hotel lacking in any real class or dedication to its customers.
0	i liked this property.[SEP]the place was clean and our room was well equipped.[SEP]one note, the walls seemed very thin.[SEP]the only downfall for us was the location.[SEP]we were very far from " downtown " seattle and were relient on taxis to get back to the great food and nightlife we were looking for.[SEP]the beds were very comfy though and there was a great mini kitchen.[SEP]all in all, the property was fine.[SEP]parking cost us $15, but i felt good about the garage.[SEP]we were only 3 blocks from the key arena and the space needle, which if that is what you want to go to seattle for, the its perfect.[SEP]we were more interested in spending time in downtown, but other than that, its a nice hotel.
0	my boyfriend and i stayed at the hilton canary wharf for three nights in early december whilst visiting london for shopping and sight seeing.[SEP]the hotel itself was very nice, with modern decor and friendly staff who assisted us with all our requests and enquiries including supplying us with a huge champagne cooler full of ice.[SEP]similarly, we found the room to be clean, comphy and spacious.[SEP]nearby the canary wharf shopping centre is a surprisingly large complex of shops, cafes and restaurants that we found very convenient during our stay.[SEP]the only downside of our stay was the location of the hotel.[SEP]upon booking we were aware that this hotel was not as central as we would have liked.[SEP]situated a short walk from canary wharf on the jubilee line, it took us a good 40mins to get to most places after walking and changing tube lines etc.[SEP]this therefore does not make the ideal location for tourists and visitors who are after all that central london has to offer.[SEP]i can, however, understand that this hotel was probably not intended for tourists and it's location is ideal for those travelling for business within the financial district.
0	we chose the mandarin oriental for its reputation as one of the best hotels in miami.[SEP]we were, however, sadly dissapointed.[SEP]the hotel did not live up to expectations.[SEP]whilst the service and food was good.[SEP]the pool is tiny with only a few sun beds, there is no beach (unlike the pictures on the website which are incredibly misleading, it surprises me they have not had any consumer related action in that respect), they charge $36 a day to park your car, and it is miles from south beach.[SEP]we made an error in the location and that was our fault - we would have been much happier on south beach, but, nonetheless, the hotel is not a 5 * one it professes to be.[SEP]i would not return to the manadrin oriental and would not recommend it to people going on holiday to miami.[SEP]it's a business hotel and nothing more.
0	loved the breakfast.[SEP]room was a spacious suite, with 2 flat screens.[SEP]the problem is that this hotel is located directly on interstate 17 and local greenway blvd.[SEP]the traffic noise in our room was deafening.[SEP]our room was located on the outside corner of hwy 17 and greenway blvd.[SEP]it felt like the trucks were drving in our room.[SEP]others in our party had courtyard rooms and loved their stay.[SEP]we arrived before anyone else in our party, and were given a nasty room location.[SEP]the room was excellent, the location was terrible.[SEP]pool area was tropical in feeling.[SEP]wifi is free.[SEP]if i had a nice room location, i would recommend this hotel to everyone.[SEP]if i go again, i would stay here only if i had a quiet room.
0	high ratings for ambiance, service and interior.[SEP]staff was very pleasant and service outstanding.[SEP]unfortunately, we found the room to be very noisy through the night.[SEP]the combination of the loud heater fan, the outside traffic noise, and the odd sound of a washing machine near the exterior wall made it very difficult to sleep.[SEP]the noise factor is why i can only give it three stars.[SEP]also the street location is not in a picturesque part of town, nor is there any nearby services to walk to.[SEP]next time visiting napa valley i will look for a place farther north and out of the city of napa.
0	the hotel is on paseo de la reina cristina, a very noisy major street with 4 lanes of cars on one side and 3 on the other, there is traffic day and night.[SEP]i got a room on the street and i could not sleep, because the window does not stop the noise.[SEP]i asked a room on the back, on a high floor, and then it was ok (no noise from outside).[SEP]one can hear some noise from neighbor rooms but this is very acceptable.[SEP]this is a big impersonal hotel, perhaps more a 3 stars and a 4 star.[SEP]the size of the double room was large enough.[SEP]the internet was free.[SEP]one has to walk to go to nicer areas, e.g. to have the choice for restaurant, the area is not specially nice.[SEP]the location is interesting if you need to take the train at atocha (e.g. if you work in some suburb which was my case).
0	the hotel is simple but clean, good for value.[SEP]the location is a little bit far from mrt station, a short bus journey, but not too much hassle.[SEP]the room is bit small, but at least clean and with comportable air conditioning.[SEP]staff are friendly and helpful.[SEP]the only thing which i can't stand is their breakfast, really not healthy and tasty.[SEP]however, in all, it is a quite a good budget hotel for young travellers to choose.
0	the hotel interior is beautiful.[SEP]but that's where it ends.[SEP]a i was told check in was at 3 pm and i was kept waiting until 4 pm.[SEP]the front desk was almost unpleasant about it and didn't offer any alternatives.[SEP]later into my stay, i tried calling the concierge repeatedly, from my room, without any luck.[SEP]i even left a message, but didn't receive a return phone call.[SEP]if you're female and travelling by yourself, i would not recommend this hotel for its location.[SEP]it's a weird spot between the hotel and the french quarter, even though it's only a block or so away.[SEP]i've spent a lot of time in new orleans, but i wouldn't recommend this hotel.[SEP]very disappointing for the price!
0	i booked this hotel on hotwire because it claimed it was a 3 star mission bay hotel.[SEP]really?[SEP]it was located right off the freeway next to a storage facility, location could be considered a light industrial area.[SEP]i used to have excellent luck with hotwire, but have been disappointed in my last couple of bookings.[SEP]especially this last one because i booked five rooms for family for our daughter's college graduation.[SEP]this hotel i d definitely a 2 star![SEP]i would like to say that the staff was kind and helpful and that the rooms were nice and clean.
0	i've just been there.[SEP]great location and good room (but without internet connection...).[SEP]but the experience wasn't very good.[SEP]just arrived, the light did not turn on in the room (the solution was to insert a folded business card into an electronic device).[SEP]then i attended a book presentation in a room (floor -2) where air conditioning wasn't working.[SEP]very unconfortable experience.[SEP]moreover, three people tried - succesfully, in the end - to activate internet connection for one of the speakers.[SEP]it took about 45 minutes.[SEP]then, when i went to the room back to sleep, i realized that air conditioning wasn't working there as well... so, not worthy of its price.
0	poor check - in, unfriendly staff, didn't clean room well, 3 days without replenishing the mini - bar, complained and nothing improved.[SEP]poor location for getting a taxi, especially on a friday night and don't expect much from the concierge or front desk staff who are too important and busy to concern themselves with their " guests' welfare.[SEP]not worth the room rate.[SEP]starting to look a bit shabby in certain areas including the rooms.[SEP]room service food quality was quite poor.[SEP]breakfast elsewhere would have been a better option.[SEP]i can't think of anything particularly positive to say about the hotel other than writing an awful review of it gives me some pleasure!
0	mixed feelings first, the positives.[SEP]a clean and spacious room with a stunning view of chapultepec castle.[SEP]very friendly staff.[SEP]convenient to chapultepec park and its various attractions.[SEP]a decent fitness center, with a 19th floor view, no less.[SEP]but there are definite negatives.[SEP]the location is not convenient to anything except the park.[SEP]it's an uncomfortably long and complicated walk to decent restaurants or cafes, and the closest metro stop (chapultepec) is a circuitous ten minute hike.[SEP]for me, though, the biggest negatives were the outrageous prices for everything beyond the room itself.[SEP]internet access?[SEP]that will be $25 per day.[SEP]i'm not kidding - $25 dollars per day![SEP]want to use the locker room after you work out in the fitness center?[SEP]that will be another $12.50.[SEP]a 200 ml bottle of water from the mini - bar?[SEP]that will set you back over four dollars.[SEP]for like three good size sips of water.[SEP](and while the maid is supposed to leave a carafe of agua purificada in the room, mine never did.[SEP]good thing there's a 7 - 11 two blocks away.)they are clearly aiming for the corporate expense account here (torre major is close by).[SEP]but i would rather have the expenses built into the room rate right up front rather than feeling nickeled and dimed to death.[SEP]it's enough to keep me from coming back.
0	i stayed in one of the rooms that, as the front desk staff so proudly explained,' is one which has yet to be renovated!'.[SEP]well i could tell.[SEP]window in the room did not close properly so we had some road noise at night.[SEP]i bit of drab decor, musty smell, loud ac unit, and the bathroom was in desperate need or renovation.[SEP]as a priority club paltinum member, i was given the' priviledge' of using the priority club business lounge, which as it turns out, are just 2 desks situated behind the bar and restaurant area, way too noisy to get any work done.[SEP]without a doubt, the world's worst location for a hi priority club loung, totaly inadequate.[SEP]the bar and restaurant (breakfast) are extremely understaffed, long and unacceptable waits for service.[SEP]althought the hotel is conveniently located just a couple of minutes from both the rai train station (to / from airport) as well as the trolley (to / from downtown) i will definately not stay here again, and choose something more central and with a more quality and service.
0	we had a special offer ($35 per night) for one of the suites and we received another upgrade at the time of check in.[SEP]lucky us (the place was packed).[SEP]the suite we had was very good, but still noice from the hallway door slamming and early bathroom activities next and above our suite.[SEP]since the rio is " on the wrong side " of the strip, all activities are done by car or at the hotel.[SEP]we arrived sunday evening and all the tables where very busy, so not much gaming action that night.[SEP]i like the new " drinks " service - i - pad waiter takes the order and a waiter / waitress comes with the ready made drinks from the bar (one way trip and fast).[SEP]buffet is overpriced, my " locals " deal didn't count since i don't have a nevada id (but i own a house in the city of summerlin next door).[SEP](very good low cost buffet at the red rock casino 15 min drive or the south point casino also only 15 min drive) the check in coupons had absolutely no value to us.[SEP]and lots of other charges if you want to use any of the things offered at the hotel.[SEP]my recommendation, sleep well for a low price and drive to another location for fun.[SEP]they offer a bus shuttle to the strip if you don't have a car.[SEP]meutermedia
0	we picked this hotel for its location to the gare du lyon (very close and a precise 5 minute easy walk) and because it looked nicer than the other local hotels.[SEP]i reserved three rooms via email and received confirmations back.[SEP]when all 6 of us arrived on a very busy paris saturday afternoon, the non - english speaking desk clerks said they only had 2 rooms reserved for us.[SEP]they didn't care at all about our issue.[SEP]sorry, but no additional room.[SEP]they ended up calling to a 2 star hotel down the street where i stayed with my husband.[SEP]a very bad end to a lovely vacation in france.[SEP]i can not recommend this hotel due to the reservation mix - up and the front desk " who cares " response.[SEP]i emailed them on my return about this issue and have not yet received a response.[SEP]not great service.[SEP]rooms are tiny tiny and apart from being close to gare du lyon its not a great location in paris (deserted at night apart from rough looking folks).[SEP]breakfast wonderful though in the am.[SEP]sunday am -- all set up by 7 a.m. promptly.[SEP]best coffee in paris!
0	i was here for a conference and was really psyched based on other reviews.[SEP]when i arrived the place was like a giant frat party... very loud and noisy with parties on various floors and several of my companions actually switched their rooms so they could sleep.[SEP]on sunday starbucks was closed.[SEP]the location is in downtown orlando... don't stay here if you plan on going to the parks or the restaurants down near the convention center.[SEP]there are many restaurants within walking distance however.[SEP]the beds are very comfy and it would have been heavenly if it was quiet.[SEP]as is typical with any marriott property, no free wi fi unless you are gold level or higher.[SEP]the pool area was closed more often than not because of private functions.[SEP]the sfaff if very pleasant but my real gripe was despite having my " please make up room sign in the door, " my room didn't get made up unti 5 pm![SEP]that was also the case for other meeting attendees.[SEP]the rooms are on the dark side and although i like art, it became a sensory overload after staying there 24 hours... by hour 72, i was ready to scream
0	sheraton people at the front desk were nice enough.[SEP]housekeeping was responsive.[SEP]sheraton advertises rooms are updated, but truth be told - rooms are only partially updated.[SEP]i stayed in an upper floor room with a nice view, but the couch was ridiculously uncomfortable to sit on.[SEP]the " dream " sleeper sofa bed was literally taped together with duct tape and when you sat on the cushions you literally sank into the sleeper bed.[SEP]the desk area and the rest of the furnishings were not placed in the room in the best manner.[SEP]closet doors could have used some painting and the refrigerator door stuck and hadn't been cleaned in a while.[SEP]the work desk and chair were old and there were strange sort of disgusting things stuck to the chair.[SEP]i had wireless issues that required calling the wireless services' help desk.[SEP]the sliding pocket door between the toilet / shower area and the dressing area stuck every time you went in and out and and was so annoying.[SEP]several times a day i heard strange noises in the walls that sounded like a very large cow mooing (old pipes maybe).[SEP]pulling up the first night at the " main " entrance, i had valet running to the car to help but when i told them i wasn't valet parking, they backed away, didn't offer a cart or a hand to unload the car.[SEP]all in all, location was close to my office, but it was not the the most comfortable room i've stayed in.
0	this place is so far away from the city, it was a nightmare.[SEP]luckily it was only for one night.[SEP]we called the hotel from the states and they said it was a 27 minute ride to the airport.[SEP]that's why we stayed there on our last night in the country.[SEP]turns out it was 90 minutes via the transit, so we ended up taking a shuttle for 55 euros.[SEP]the directions that they gave to us were poor as well.[SEP]after you get off the subway, there is supposed to be a bus to the corner near the hotel, but we couldn't find it, and had to take a taxi.[SEP]once we checked in, the toilet wouldn't flush.[SEP]when i called to tell them, the phone didn't work.[SEP]this place was just bought by mariott, and the manager said that they were working out the " kinks, " but, based on location alone, this isn't a good spot unless you've got some business in this suburb.
0	the standard room is extremely small, do upgrade one room category to get the amazing round bath tub.[SEP]location - horrible for two reasons 1.[SEP]currently a worksite directly across the road for the new cruise terminal, this will go on for some time.[SEP]was awoken at 7 am by this work site that goes 14 hour days 7 days a week.[SEP]2.[SEP]almost impossible to find a taxi in kowloon that will take you there in peak traffic.[SEP]i sat in 4 before one agreed to do the journey, this is because the meters run on kilometers travelled and not trip time.[SEP]service - lots of staff, however they are not very willing to assist and choose to stand in clusters and avoid eye contact with you.[SEP]lots of school trips there and conference groups etc, can make for alot of noise whilst they assemble in the lobby for outings etc.[SEP]massive lobby and check in desks, the set up is correct, staff performance is questionable.
0	i wouldn't call this a four - star hotel, however it was nice, clean, and quiet and we enjoyed our stay.[SEP]all the people working at the front desk were nice and accommodating, and the night bartenders were friendly and helpful as well.[SEP]the rooms are large and the bathroom is well set up with the vanity separate from the bath / toilet.[SEP]we found the location just too far away from the action to be convenient.[SEP]after our first trip on the bus / metro (for us was quite confusing...) we found it would just be much easier to rent a scooter so that we could do things on our own schedule.[SEP]the breakfast was delicious with tons of options, which is a good thing, because you will want to eat it-- otherwise you will be starving by the time you get to rome's center.[SEP]overall the only thing we disliked, other than the location, was that getting wifi is ridiculously expensive at the hotel and there was no inexpensive options in the immediate area that we could find.[SEP]otherwise, a great hotel for the price.
0	nice hotel, fantastic helpful staff.[SEP]was very pleased with my stay here, but it was for a business conference.[SEP]hotel facilities are great, swimming pools, basic gym, sauna, bars... etc.[SEP]great view from swimming pool at top.[SEP]great shower in bedrooms.[SEP]well equiped rooms.[SEP]if you are asked, ask for a room with a city view (not beach!).[SEP]was lucky enough to be on 17th floor with city view and could see whole city (and the sites).[SEP]beach view is building sites![SEP]air - con was broken in room, but that was just unlucky (i just opened the window instead!) there is no beach near - by.[SEP]it is all under development, so go else - where if you want the beach.[SEP]not much in this area (couple of cafe's near - by).[SEP]metro / undergound is 5mins walk and will take you straight into centre (2euro's single).[SEP]there are several hotels round this area and if you had to choose one for its location for conferences (e.g ccib) this is definately the best.[SEP]if you are on a city - break, would strongly recommend getting a hotel in centre.[SEP]metro is convenient but does take 30mins or so getting in and back from centre and stops at 1 am.[SEP]plus no bars near the hotel.[SEP]overall: great hotels with facilities.[SEP]great choice for business.[SEP]if site - seeing / holiday, go to hotel in centre
0	the timeshare (points) units were well appointed and comfrotable.[SEP]we stayed in a spacious 2 bedroom unit with 4 adults and 2 kids.[SEP]plenty of room.[SEP]the amenities were ample with a great pool area.[SEP]the location and landscaping left much to be desired.[SEP]the food and drink are way overpriced.[SEP]the sales pitch was low key.[SEP]if you can get in this may be a good alternative to an expensive hotel room suite.
0	i wouldn't recommend this hotel to any other travelers to key west.[SEP]its extremely overpriced ; i wouldn't have even paid half as much as i did to stay there again.[SEP]the location isn't great.[SEP]its pretty much as far from duval and the activities in old town as you can get, which i admittedly knew going in.[SEP]there was a shopping center within easy walking distance so that may be a plus to some.[SEP]the room itself was horrible.[SEP]we had a 3 bedroom suite, and while it was big it looked and smelled like it was 30 years old.[SEP]the stench almost knocked us off our feet when we got in.[SEP]other problems included no blankets for the sleeper sofa, garbage all around the room, exposed wiring, staircase to the upper level shaking violently when used (to the point where i truly feared that someone would break it during the weekend), and ants running across the counter tops in the kitchen.[SEP]the breakfast left a lot to be desired, which shouldn't have been much of a surprise based on the size of the reception area.[SEP]the service was poor overall, both housekeeping and check - in.[SEP]overall, i would never stay at the hotel again and would recommend others to keep away as well.[SEP]unless this is the only option, find somewhere else.[SEP]it doesn't offer anything special, and the rates aren't something to get excited about either.
0	poor location   this hotel is actually located in suburb of bass hill not bankstown.[SEP]the approximate cost to by taxi to bankstown was aud $23.00.[SEP]the exterior look of the hotel is old and dated.[SEP]inside, the rooms are fully renovated and actually quite lovely ; they have dream beds which are very comfortablethe location is not ideal, a taxi driver warned us not to go out at night.[SEP]the hotel security guard had a baton passed his knee and also a german sheppard dog as part of security for the hotel.[SEP]it is in the middle of suburbia with nothing around you apart from mcdonalds which is located next door.[SEP]room service was disappointing ; the steak i ordered was inedible so they kindly replaced it with a safe chicken parma which was very average.[SEP]i was advised that the steak would not be charged to my room.[SEP]they had a movie deal, which included breakfast, movies and munchies.[SEP]the munchies consisted of microwave popcorn, sounds great except for the fact that the room does not have a microwave![SEP]customer service at check in / out was also disappointing, i had to get my hotel bill corrected three times before i could pay for it.[SEP]that steak did appear on the bill.[SEP]i would suggest staying at a hotel in a better location.
0	room - i had a king suite and it was waaaaaay smaller than it looked on the marriott springhill suites website.[SEP]so right away my expectations were not met.[SEP]i was expecting something sleek and comfortable to host me and my 3 travel companions.[SEP]the pull - out couch could not hold more than 1 person like it claimed unless both people were small children.[SEP]the bathroom and couch area were pretty darn small too.[SEP]the room was clean, but it also seemed kind of old.[SEP]amenities - the breakfast was tasty and had lots of options, though it could have used with more carb alternatives - not everyone wants to start their day with a big spike to their blood sugar.[SEP]the shuttle was limited to 3 drop - off points, all fairly close to the hotel anyway, and departed the hotel only once per hour.[SEP]location - it's kind of secluded and doesn't feel too safe.[SEP]if you stay here, be prepared to walk, walk, walk because the hotel is not adjacent to any attractions.[SEP]the front desk does conveniently provide maps of seattle.
0	location: right next to the highway which is great but there are lots of sketchy people hanging out around this place.[SEP]ladies of the night, bums, drunks and druggies all eyeballing you and harassing other people.[SEP]the room: dirty, stained carpets, stained sheets, pee on the toilet, grease on and around the doorknob and door, looked like bloodstains on the back of the door.[SEP]there was an overwhelming feeling of filth in the room.[SEP]service: lady at the front desk barely spoke english and didn't understand procedures policies of the hotel.[SEP]when i asked for a new room they said there was no other rooms, when i asked for a refund because i would not stay in the room, she didn't know what to do.[SEP]when the service i used to book the hotel tried to contact them, the representative was hung up on three different times.[SEP]could never get a manager on the phone to resolve the issue.
0	if you are looking for a good deal costwise, don't stay here![SEP]we stayed at the hotel during the first weekend in march because got a good deal on hotwire.com ($134/night).[SEP]the biggest problem with this hotel is its location.[SEP]it is located directly across the street from the airport - at times it was difficult to sleep because we could hear planes flying overhead.[SEP]its also located away from all of the major attractions, so if you don't have a car, you end up spending a lot of money on cabs.[SEP]if you do have a car (we rented one for the weekend), you end up paying $17/day to park at the hotel.[SEP]after paying for transportation, it didn't seem like a good deal at all.[SEP]the room we stayed in (in the east tower) was clean, but extremely bare.[SEP]it clearly had been updated in several years.[SEP]we did use the spa, which was small, but the service was great.[SEP]all of the employees we encountered at the hotel, from the front desk to the concierge to the spa staff to the staff at the main restaurants were exceptionally friendly and offered prompt service.[SEP]the staff was the best part of the experience.
0	this was rated as a five star hotel, and i was recommended by amex centurion travel.[SEP]when i got there, i was pretty shocked at the location - completely in the middle of a busy commercial district.[SEP]walking around the grounds all i could think of was, " city of industry " the rooms were tourist class.[SEP]marble with tub, etc.[SEP]but nothing special.[SEP]everybody outside of the front desk speaks only spanish (including in the spa) so be prepared for that.[SEP]the airconditioning unit didn't work well, and the room was at 28c nearly the whole stay until the last day when they fixed it.[SEP]the pool is small and rectangular, with neat recliner chairs in stainless steel submerged in the pool that blow bubbles through it.[SEP]the spa was highly rated, but it was just average.[SEP]getting a massage service was very odd because the music was this crazy imitation disco music from the u.s. so just imagine trying to relax to a spanish version of ymca playing at moderate volume, with a thick spanish accent.
0	bbooked hotel on expedia and requested a queen bed room- i know there is always the ts and cs text which says your room choice is not guaranteed but i guess you always presume if you book it early enough then you'll get the room you want.[SEP]anyway when we turned up they said they had no double bed rooms left so we'd have to have a room with 3 singles.[SEP]not impressed.[SEP]they said this was the case for lots of guests.[SEP]they weren't very apologetic and didn't offer any compensation or free breakfast or anything.[SEP]the location was ok.[SEP]very close to museum train station but not as central as i would have liked.[SEP]room was ok, quiet small and bathroom was very dated, as was the tv etc overall it was ok but i would not stay here again
0	i used this hotel for business because of its location to the conference center and my stay has been nothing but problems.[SEP]1.[SEP]problems with reservation - hotel could not find my (or my 3 colleagues') reservation, even though i had an actual printout.[SEP]they were able to accommodate but only after 15 minutes of waiting around the registration desk.[SEP]2.[SEP]we had cancelled two reservations approximately a week prior to our arrival but the hotel is claiming a' no show.' again, i have a printout of the cancellation that clearly confirms the cancellation.[SEP]3.[SEP]internet is 20 euros and there is a charge to use the pool.[SEP]i have never been to a " 5-star " where you are asked to pay to swim.[SEP]fitness and swim is 16 euros.[SEP]4.[SEP]iron not provided - again, they do ask you to give shirts for laundry... for a hefty charge of 12 euros a shirt.[SEP]5.[SEP]my king bed is made of two smaller beds just pushed together which are not very comfortable to begin with.[SEP]i would recommend going to another hotel and not staying here.[SEP]the hotel is very clean and the staff do seem relatively helpful but find another place, especially given the price.
0	i stayed at the westin for four nights for a conference.[SEP]i've stayed at many westin hotels and this one falls firmly in the middle of the pack.[SEP]the things i liked about the hotel were: the heavenly bed, the maid was very friendly, the workout and pool facilities and check in and out was very efficient.[SEP]there were some minor service issues such as: no newspaper on the first morning of visit -- i called and it was delivered quickly, room service breakfast was delivered 15 minutes ahead of schedule--8:00am vs the requested 8:15 - 8:30 time slot and had the wrong juice, internet access is very expensive in the room and there is a charge for service in the business center, room amenities are less than impressive -- stingy number of towels and sub - par toiletries, you have to request things like cotton swabs and a bathrobe and the atm machine in the hotel seemed to be broken for my entire visit.[SEP]perhaps the biggest problem with this hotel is its location.[SEP]while it is not far from the subway, it is also not across the street or a block or two away.[SEP]you have to walk a few blocks and then under a freeway to get to union station which is the closest subway stop.[SEP]while it is doable, there are other hotels in the same price point that are more centrally located.
0	upon arriving at this hotel we were led down a mouldy rabbit warren of corridors and stairs to our room, having to drag our luggage with no offer of assistance from indifferent staff.[SEP]wet paint slightly quenched the smell of vomit on the carpet which i nearly stood in.[SEP]the first room of many had no windows, basically a basement with it's damp, moudly smell.[SEP]we were horrified as they pointed to bunk beds crammed into the corner, something not even mentioned prior to arrival.[SEP]unsure of the legal breaches the hotel was surely making we demanded another room and hotel staff were uniterested and argumentative.[SEP]one morning as were trying to exit the hotel we nearly got locked in the stairwell which we had to use due to there being an insufficient number of lifts for the amount of other unfortunate guests in the hotel.[SEP]as for location, i am not even quite sure that this hotel is still located in london.[SEP]to get to the centre of the city was a 15 minute walk down the road to the bus stop, which took us to a train station which was approximately 40 minutes.[SEP]somewhat tiring to do every day.[SEP]don't stay here!!
0	not a bad hotel, nice enough rooms but the location was a bit dodgy, you had to walk past the homeless hang - out or walk quite a long way round to avoid it![SEP]on site cafe was expensive but i can recommend the garage across the road who were helpful, friendly and cheap.[SEP]as for the complimentary shuttle..........[SEP]desk staff were unhelpful and the shuttle staff were rude and unwilling to take anyone anywhere - with the exception of one of the elderly drivers who was brilliant.[SEP]ok if you can get it cheap otherwise i'd shop around for a more convenient location.
0	the hotel was nice, loved the scent they use use in the lobby![SEP]we loved the help from the concierge service who helped us get alcatraz tickets that were quickly selling out - thanks bill![SEP]the hotel practically has everything you need.[SEP]we forgot a razor and a toothbrush and they were able to bring both to our room.[SEP]but, the only negative to the hotel is the location.[SEP]this was our first trip to san francisco so we weren't sure where to stay - but always heard union square is the place.[SEP]the hotel is walking distance to the square, by there is not a whole lot of choices for dinner.[SEP]we were disappointed by bad meals near the hotel and that the xxx area is just a few blocks away - with some pretty scary locals hanging around.[SEP]with that said i would like to say that our favorite area was ghirardelli square & (all time fave) chesnut street - it has fabulous dining options and wonderful one - of - a - kind boutique shopping.[SEP]also, san fran hasn't figured out a solution for their homeless population.[SEP]we didn't have any issues but it would be hard with small children i think.[SEP]and really sad to see:(seemed like more here than in nyc.[SEP]recommendations: alcatraz tour really is all it's cracked up to be... great, nicely run tour.[SEP]top notch![SEP]muir woods, and absolute must is to walk the golden gate bridge... it's absolutely breath taking!
0	this hotel looks very nice when you first walk in.[SEP]the receptionist was very grumpy and unwelcoming, i felt like i was getting interrogated.[SEP]once i recieved my key i made it up the marble staircase on the groundfloor and after which turned into old battered concrete.[SEP]the lighting was terrible and the hallways were about a doorways width.[SEP]this gave an impression of some sort of squatters accomodation.[SEP]after finding my room and opening the door the quality of the room matched the quality of the hallway.[SEP]the bedding looked about 10 years old and was terribly creaky.[SEP]there was a sink in the room as it would not fit in the place that was meant to be a bathroom.[SEP]this was a tiny cubicle with a toilet and shower squashed in, again very low quality.[SEP]the one towel provided was the size of a tea towel.[SEP]the room had a very small window with a very nice view of a big air vent.[SEP]there was a very unpleasent and unrelaxing vibe to this hotel and therefore i was forced to check out early and find other accomodation in which for the same price i found a proper hotel in a better location.[SEP]i would not recommend this hotel to anyone as it is very decieving and better accomodation can be found for your money.
0	my friend and i recently stayed at the hotel ibis in al barsha.[SEP]i'd read the reviews of the hotel prior to going, so had a fair idea of what to expect.[SEP]the hotel was modest, no extra niceties, but for the price that we paid, it was a pretty decent hotel.[SEP]the rooms are small, but not smaller than expected and it was an ample size for my friend and i.[SEP]the bathroom is riduculously small, allowing just enough room to turn around in![SEP]there are no extractor fans and so the condensation remains in the bathroom for quite a long time.[SEP]the shower did present a bit of problem in that the water ran out onto the bathroom floor.[SEP]this meant that we had to order extra towels to mop up the excess water.[SEP]the hotel is more suited to business travellers (although you have to pay for the internet) and doesn't have a pool.[SEP]there were no facilities for simply relaxing in the sun, making a trip to the beach a necessity.[SEP]don't use the hotel taxis (white taxis) as they at lest a third more expensive than the dubai taxis (the cream and red / blue taxis).[SEP]the location was ok, although the hotel ibis, mall of the emirates would have been slighly more central for us.[SEP]overall, the hotel was good for the price, but i would not stay there again.
0	the hotel is located in a crummy part of town.[SEP]after looking at our room, my wife and i left to find another hotel, as she did not feel safe this this part of town.[SEP]even after cancelling the room by phone, the hotel refused to refund the deposit.[SEP]the hotel lobby is tiny.[SEP]it's about 15 by 15 feet.[SEP]i can't imagine having more than three to four people eat breakfast this this location.[SEP]for $15 a night more you can stay at a great best western in la jolla ; just 15 minutes north.[SEP]i stayed in la jolla for three nights before trying the downtown area.[SEP]the bw in la jolla is in a great location in addition to having a nice outdoor pool.[SEP]i am a frequent best western user.[SEP]the cabrillo garden needs to drop the word " best " from it's name.[SEP]it surpises me that a good hotel chain would have the cabrillo garden as part of its chain.[SEP]it's a dump compared to other bw's.[SEP]we ended up staying at the embassy suites which was fantastic.[SEP]sure it was more expensive, but well worth it.
0	we stayed for 5 days in the high season.the hotel was very clean and we had a nice room after we complained about the first one.[SEP]the bed was excellent.[SEP]the staff was nice and the breakfast buffet was very good and included.[SEP]i liked the feel of the hotel on the inside kind of like a old hacienda.[SEP]we did nt like the location... there was no shuttle to the beach and it is either a 1 - 2 mile walk or a cab ride.[SEP]we do nt golf but if you do its on top of a nice golf course.[SEP]it was too isolated for us.[SEP]the pool area was pleasant but the pool was small.[SEP]the spa cost an extra 15.00 a day per person and did nt look worth it... it was huge, but most of the water areas were in separated male - female areas and they were indoors with no windows.[SEP]we found one mineral jacuzzi upstairs but it did nt seem worth the money for that.[SEP]the spa was very empty, too empty.[SEP]i would only recommend this hotel to a golfer who liked alot of quiet.
0	room was clean and pleasant.[SEP]compact size but what you'd expect in manhattan for the price.[SEP]my biggest issue was noise from the subway and street - try and get on a higher floor if you stay here (i was on 4).[SEP]staff were helpful and professional, i really only interacted with them on check - in and check - out and both were fine.[SEP]location was ok, not great.[SEP]after years of travelling to ny and staying midtown, i thought i would try soho.[SEP]i definitely missed the boat on that one - i didn't find any interesting art studios etc, just fast food stores and clothing outlets.[SEP]positives were that this hotel is very close to a subway (canal st) and chinatown.[SEP]if you're interested in midtown and uptown sights and shopping however, you'll be on the subway for a while each day.
0	the hotel itself is clean and fairly new.[SEP]pool is small but decent.[SEP]room came with two queen beds instead of the doubles you find in a lot of hotels now.[SEP]there is free internet and free breakfast.[SEP]the room did not, however, have a mini - fridge or microwave or in - room safe.[SEP]the parking lot was very well lit at night, which is great.[SEP]but the location is terrible.[SEP]it is just off i-465 at 71st/73rd in an industrial area.[SEP]after the businesses close for the night, the area is secluded.[SEP]you have to drive miles to " nearby " restaurants unless you want fast food.[SEP]closest shopping was also miles away.[SEP]this hotel is fine if you have to stay in this particular area, but for leisure stays, i would definitely choose a different hotel in a better location.
0	we had a room with a king sized bed on the third floor.[SEP]the view was of an elementary school next door.[SEP]the room was on the small side for a hotel of this level, but had all of the amenitites.[SEP]soft, comfy sheets and great pillow.[SEP]plenty of towels and toiletries.[SEP]my best friend and i traveled to nyc for a girls' weekend to sight see and go to a broadway show.[SEP]this hotel seems to be more for business than pleasure stays.[SEP]the location is more high end residential and is a little out of the way for tourists.[SEP]there are no late night eateries close by.[SEP]i would not recommend this hotel for tourists on a tight schedule, due to the distance from tourist attractions.
0	my partner and i have recently returned from 3 nights and it is a beautiful place.[SEP]on arrival, the receptionist was extremely helpful - gave us a map of the city and pointed out places of interest..[SEP]it's location is very good.[SEP]we had booked a " double classic " room which is the hotel's standard room.[SEP]the room itself was very nice - well decorated but not particularly large but it has a very nice view.[SEP]a little pricey but well worth it.[SEP]we did have a problem with the heating in our room but it did get sorted out right away when we asked from the front desk.[SEP]we did eat in the restaurant on our first evening when we arrived late and it was very good - good service, good food, decent wine (good selections) and a very reasonable price plus, when we went back for lunch on our last day they treated us like old friends![SEP]there is a gym in the hotel but we didn't manage to use it just have a look.[SEP]great exercise equipments.[SEP]i would definitely recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here again.(specially at spring / summer when the roof top restaurant will be open).
0	the room we had was very good as was the hotel surrounds.[SEP]the location is unfortunate as it is a long way to walk anywhere so unless you have your own transport or decide to chance your luck on the shuttle service i would avoid this hotel.[SEP]my introduction to the hotel was unfortunate when i asked " mr grumpy' if the hotel had a iron.[SEP]he replied' use laundry service'.[SEP]he clearly misunderstood (so i thought), so i said again, no i was just after an iron - response' use laundry service'.[SEP]i then asked for an area map and it was placed on the table in front of my and he was gone before i could ask any questions - no, he didn't have other customers to attend to![SEP]day one of our stay we used the restaurant for dinner we ordered off the menu and it was quite good.[SEP]we recommended to others on our tour and they joined us for the buffet.[SEP]the buffet was dreadful and when they ran out of something they didn't replenish.
0	have stayed here on several trips to boston, but would be reluctant to do so again.[SEP]arrived later in the evening and was given a room where the heat was not working.[SEP]it was 17 degrees outside.[SEP]the desk asked if i would like to wait 30 min to see if the heat would work or change the room.[SEP]i opted for the latter.[SEP]the desk was accomodating and changed the room.[SEP]the second room was not as in good condition as the first, but at that hour, i let it slide.[SEP]the location is out of the way and a little hard to get to... one missed turn, you're in southie.[SEP]sometimes the parking is free, sometimes it isn't(this weekend it wasn't.). for something very basic, the place is ok.[SEP]i am back in this area next month and have changed my reservation to another hilton property.
0	i am somewhat suspicious that the reviews listed for this property may not be from guests.[SEP]the hotel is in a somewhat seedy location.[SEP]there are rooms that face an alley where the next door pizza resaturant has trash cans that get rattled throughout the night.[SEP]upon entering the hotel you can get a strong disinfectant smell.[SEP]our room had no heat so they gave us a portable heater.[SEP]guess what?[SEP]it overloaded the circuit, went off, and then the overhead lights would not come on.[SEP]the first room they showed us had lamp shades missing or damaged and the outside veranda ovrelooking the street was carpeted with that green astro turf looking stuff.[SEP]how this continues to get a high rating is beyoind me.
0	following a stay at a great hotel at anaheim, we headed down the coast to san diego.[SEP]i chose the embassy suites based on their website - i was looking for a hotel with a good location that had suite capacity for a family of four (we have two young children).[SEP]we arrived at the hotel at night.[SEP]valet parking is very expensive and the set down / foyer area is noisy and chaotic.[SEP]we had to wait for a while for check in and the atmosphere felt quite unfriendly and very impersonal.[SEP]the hotel is set around a central atrium - our suite was on the second floor and the noise from the atrium was not pleasant.[SEP]the rooms had a cheap and dated feel.[SEP]lots of chips in the furniture.[SEP]the sofa bed had no sheets / bedding and was not made up.[SEP]we requested room service and the burger was raw in the middle.[SEP]food was expensive compared to rest of our vacation experiences.[SEP]i just felt very uneasy with the whole hotel and room environment.[SEP]not a comfortable atmosphere for us at all.[SEP]location wise, we ended up driving to balboa park area as the public transport seemed too long / multiple changes.[SEP]we decided to check out after one night and stayed at a hotel at carlsbad (about 30 minutes drive north) highly recommended by trip advisor reviews and thank goodness we did as that experience was much much better.
0	this hotel has a very helpful staff but in general i did not find it truly impressive.[SEP]the location of the hotel is terrible, while it is in the center of downtown, there is nothing nice surrounding it.[SEP]actually, every night there seems to be a congregation of dicey characters outside every single corner of the hotel block.[SEP]although this is not a problem of the hotel per se, after, staying 5 nights in downtown san diego the area is pretty dull.[SEP]the room- i stayed in one of the spg rooms and while the room was spacious, the details were missing.[SEP]two out of five night i had to complain about the cleaning service, the sink and the shower were clogged and the ac was noisy.[SEP]i have to say that the common areas of the hotel are nice, especially the lobby.[SEP]bottom line- i do not really see the point in staying in downtown san diego, one is better off renting a car and staying in one of the nice places in la jolla or all the little town around.
0	location: it's a pretty far walk from old montreal, but it's walkable.[SEP]with some connecting stops on the subway you can get to old montreal from the hotel to the champs - de - mars stop.[SEP]the hotel is located about 2 blocks away from what i'd consider to be montreal's " red light district.[SEP]" it is located on st.[SEP]catherine street and if you walk a couple of blocks (5 - 6) towards dairy queen you start to hit some decent shopping.[SEP]eating: the diner, eggspectations, is right down stairs, they make reallly good french toast![SEP]and the hotel is located right above the complex des jardin's food court.[SEP]the hotel has a restaurant, aswell, but it was under renovations while i was there.[SEP]hotel: small rooms, dimly lit, basic amenities, small bathroom, not impressed.[SEP]wouldn't stay again.
0	i went with my wife on vacation for a week and we stayed here.[SEP]the hotel itself is gorgeous.[SEP]it has a private beach and since its located in the west part of oahu, the sunset is spectacular.[SEP]the resort does plan activities throughout the week but my wife and i decided to explore the island on our own and did not take part in any on - site activities.[SEP]rooms were fairly spacious, we had an efficiency bedroom.[SEP]they have a gym with i believe is open 24 hours (which i found to be extremely convenient).[SEP]the service and housekeeping was excellent.[SEP]i very much loved the free wifi and the free parking (free for members only).[SEP]the only downside is the location of the resort.[SEP]most of the activities we did throughout the week involved being in the north shore, east side and honolulu area so every day involved driving to our destinations.[SEP]i would highly recommend renting a car.[SEP]the traffic in honolulu is not so bad if you avoid the peak hours.[SEP]if you want to visit places in oahu, my advice would be to start early in the morning and bring everything that you need with you, haul it in the trunk of your car and go out and explore!!![SEP]its a beautiful island and i would definitely go back!!!
0	a plain and simple hotel, located on a busy street with many company offices nearby i can't imagine a tourist staying here.[SEP]it is far away from the city center, and anything that a tourist might be interested in.[SEP]in general, you will need a car, or a taxi to get to anything unless your business office is within walking distance.[SEP]about € 25 from the airport via taxi, this fairly modern looking hotel is very plain and simple in desgin, layout and comforts.[SEP]functional, and at a rate of about € 85 per night - it was almost a bargain.[SEP]surprisingly quite given the location on the street, my " no smoking " room was clearly smoked in.[SEP]upon complaining - it was explained to me that the room was in fact no - smoking.[SEP]no offer to move me, no thought that there might be an issue.... who knows, perhaps they had heard this before.[SEP]breakfast included, a simple breakfast that was ok in general, and nothing special.[SEP]i would only recommend staying here if you are close enough to what you need to go to that you can walk.
0	spotless hotel this is a great hotel.[SEP]really clean and the rooms are spacious and luxurious.[SEP]i only wish it was more central.[SEP]i don't mind walking at all and knew it was a distance from the main sites when i booked it.[SEP]however, the problem is that the walk into the centre of florence isn't really a pleasant stroll.[SEP]it is along a dusty, commercial street and doesn't reflect the real essence of florence.[SEP]the area of the hotel is ok but it is on a very busy and huge roundabout.[SEP]there are great restaurants nearby (i.e. alfredos) but again their location isn't brilliant - not much seating outside and just along a normal town street.[SEP]however, bearing in mind that it is a real bargain for the price, the breakfasts are fantastic, the front desk are so friendly, you get a free welcome drink in the bar, there are extra luxuries like the tv sound being piped into the bathroom, the beds are very comfy, everywhere is spotless, i still think it is a good place to stay.
0	stayed four nights in sept.[SEP]i did not find the staff very helpful in giving directions or helping with the room.[SEP]room was basic.[SEP]i had a single very small bed no a / c but had a large window that opened.[SEP]maid and min bar just came in room without knocking.[SEP]large breakfast buffet if you like cold eggs and hot dogs.[SEP]lunch meat was good.[SEP]it took over 1 hour to get from airport to hotel i took the bus fro airport to the underground then another 20min ride to tierpark.[SEP]there is a sign saying what exit to take but after that you have to guess which way to go.[SEP]if you have large suitcase you do not want to go in the wrong direction.[SEP]finally asked someone and he looked it up on his phone and pointed me in the right direction about 400 m from exit.[SEP]i did not like this hotel because if weather is bad walking to metro is long andcold andwet i would pay a little more and get a more central location next time
0	the location was bad because it looked very lonely and dangerous for a traveler.[SEP]we found it hard to find, because it's pretty far from the metro (furio camillo station, about 700 meters).[SEP]the room was normal, bed was fine and king - sized, bathroom was good.[SEP]we could listen to the trains outside, but if you get to the hotel after a long day of walking, you won't notice that noise on the moment you lay on the bed to rest.[SEP]did not include free wi - fi access (roma was a place were a free hotspot was hard to find).[SEP]we had to pay 4.00 eur for an hour of access.[SEP]at the check out they carged us 2.00 eur per person per day because of a " city tax ".[SEP]the hotel had a private taxi service, we had to buy the service (50.00 eur to fiumicino airport) because we needed to get to the airport by 05.00 am.[SEP]that service was great, it was a very nice taxi (mercedes benz e - class)
0	good points - great hotel.[SEP]pool area superb, activities good, waterslide never got boring and staff are excellent.[SEP]rooms are brand new and cleaned every day.[SEP]having an apartment with all the mod cons is a real bonus with a yooung family.[SEP]i may never go anywhere again unless its a grand vacations by hilton.[SEP]bad points - only one location.[SEP]it is however a bigger issue than any of the other reviews have made.[SEP]you may well be two miles from disney world but it will cost you 35 bucks in a cab.[SEP]you can however get the hotel shuttle and it only costs 6 bucks return.[SEP]it runs on time and only goes to other hiltons so only takes 40 mins max and parc soleil seems to be the first drop off so you're back from the parks in 20 mins.[SEP]there are three drop off and pickup times.[SEP]the biggest drawback is the fact that you can not walk anywhere from your hotel as there are no walkways.[SEP]you have a major road with no pavements at the entrance to your hotel so you must use a car or taxi to go anywhere.[SEP]this was a real issue for me especially as you have no shop on site so we had to taxi to local walmart and stock up.[SEP]apart from location this is an excellent hotel and i would go back but maybe with a hired car.
0	i am a very frequent user of hotels in amsterdam due to business and i can say the hotel itself is one of the best.[SEP]the very modern and minimal design is perfect for me and everything worked as it was supposed to.[SEP]the gym is small but good and the restaurant is good also (if slow service).[SEP]i would still choose other hotels over this because of the location.[SEP]it is not particularly conveniently placed for getting into town (you can walk with 10 - 15 mins) or do the same journey in a tram which is roughly the same time once you account for waiting time.
0	i booked this hotel through pirceline and paid only $40 for one night.[SEP]at first, i was worried about the quality of the hotel, since it is only a 3-star hotel.[SEP]however, my view changed when i checked into this hotel.[SEP]the hotel is very clean, which is a big plus for me.[SEP]the price is very good as well.[SEP]the restaurants / food options at this hotel are better and cheaper than treasure island i've stayed at.[SEP]there are couple of things everyone should be aware of: 1) location: it is a little bit far from the strip.[SEP]if you don't mind taking the deuce, it should not be too costly to get to the strip.[SEP]2) booking surcharge: when i checked in, they told me that there is an additional $7 daily surcharge for using the gym and the swimming pool.[SEP]i know that treasure island also charge a surcharge to use these facilities.[SEP]however, treasure island did not force people to pay this, whereas the surcharge at stratosphere is obligatory.[SEP]on the other hand, there is a very nice outdoor swimming pool that is available at the hotel.[SEP]overall, i might not stay at stratosphere again.[SEP]even though the price was reasonable, after the daily surcharge and my taxi fare to get to the strip, it is not much cheaper than other options on the strip.[SEP]if you plan to stay at the hotel and use all the fitness facilities, it might worth checking out.
0	the main problem with this hotel is the staff.[SEP]they are rude and un helpful.[SEP]at frist i thought it was because i was english but i heard the way they treated other people from ireland and france and they got no help from them as wel.[SEP]the hotel location is ok for the beach but make sure you are not on the street after dark.[SEP]the hotel is a poor 3star.[SEP]no bar no room service after 10 pm and if they have a function they take all the lounge area and pool area away from you.[SEP]look around there are better cheeper hotels in barcelona
0	nice enough hotel - decent pool.[SEP]rooms small but not too cramped - pretty standard for hong kong in this price range.[SEP]front desk staff surly, not smiling, bordering on rude and not helpful and generally made me feel like i was a burden anytime i asked them something or needed help.[SEP]totally inflexible with solving guest problems and i noticed this when listening to them deal with other guests too.[SEP]shuttle bus often full and doesn't seem to stick to their published timetable.[SEP]location is really bad - near the old kai tak airport - and about 10 minutes in a cab to nathan road.[SEP]however, jump on the 5b double decker bus outside the door to the star ferry terminal for a leisurely sightseeing trip if you have time.[SEP]buffet breakfast was extensive and really good.[SEP]note: they don't accept debit cards here for a guarantee - even if its a visa or mastercard debit card which is crazy.[SEP]probably safer for them to use this than a credit card![SEP]made checking in a completely painful experience.[SEP]i've never found a hotel anywhere with a similar polcy that doesn't accept debit cards - madness!
0	me and my wife spent a 7 day holiday in new york in march 2012.[SEP]the hotel is in a central location with easy access to the subway, and the port authority bus station (buses from and to newark airport, and woodbury commons).[SEP]the public areas of the hotel are fine, and the rooms - although pretty small - are very nice.[SEP]the staff at the reception are friendly and helpful.[SEP]the area surrounding the hotel is very noisy, and can be dodgy at night.[SEP]although we did not have any incidents to report, the overall feel and look was rather unpleasant.[SEP]moreover, the level of the noise is quite high (even in higher floors, since constructions are taking place).
0	right as we entered, they were rude and condescending towards me and my friends.[SEP]the managers were very rude on the phone and charged us additionally for not " cleaning' the room after we left.[SEP]they kept their condescending tone every time we spoke to them.[SEP]decent location but if you want a hotel get book any other.[SEP]also the hotel manager did not return my call till a week later and after me calling the 3rd time and hung up on me rudely.
0	postives: room & bathroom quite large & nice.[SEP]very comfortable bed.[SEP]all rooms have balconies.[SEP]quiet.[SEP]negatives: it's not in a convenient location.[SEP]parking is expensive and do not have the breakfast buffet.[SEP]almost $30 a person for baked goods, cereals, runny eggs, bacon and sausage.[SEP]total rip off.
0	the hotel industry in italy is obviously virtually unregulated.[SEP]how this hotel can claim any stars at all is beyond me.[SEP]it's dishonest and misleading.[SEP]they should at least be challenged for false advertising as the description is misleading to put it mildy.[SEP]the hotel is at least half an hour out of rome, it's near nothing of interest.[SEP]awful location.[SEP]on checking in, your date of birth is demanded.[SEP]when i asked why this was needed and what it would be used for, they simply kept repeating that they needed it.[SEP]the rooms are tiny and grubby and very brown, even so, the carpet and bedspreads clearly need a good clean.[SEP]the bathroom tiles were cracked and broken.[SEP]there was a hole in the wall where the tap was coming away from the wall.[SEP]water was tepid, just what you need after a long day.[SEP]there are only 2 lifts and they are always busy, you have to queue for it and most of the time people simply used the fire escape stairs.[SEP]a colleague had money stolen from his room.[SEP]breakfast was absolutely average.[SEP]don't go there as it will spoil your perception of italy
0	i've been to no quite a few times - usually stay at place d'armes (great hotel).[SEP]wanted to try something different this time - chose hotel provincial.[SEP]we had a room at the front of the hotel overlooking the street - very noisy at night (walls are seriously paper - thin).[SEP]lots of kids visiting the same time we were and the hotel courtyard was filled with teenagers from a school trip that made a lot of noise during early morning hours (1:30a.m.!) in the courtyard with no warning from the front desk (which is located adjacent to the courtyard) to keep the noise level down per their posted signs indicating that the courtyard closes at 11 p.m. towels were rationed to the point where we would only get 1 towel each day and had to request more (hand towels, wash cloths, etc.). on our first night at the hotel, two cop cars had apprehended a seedy looking character right across the street from the hotel.[SEP]the next night - 2 more cop cars at the other corner.[SEP]we thought this would be a quiet and safe location, but next time will return to the place d'armes or try another hotel in the french quarter.[SEP]don't get a room near the swimming pool - that was packed with people and it was loud, loud, loud all day and night!
0	i booked a three night stay at the hampton inn in vancouver at the end of november based on the incredible reviews from tripadvisor.com.[SEP]the hampton inn is a nice budget hotel.[SEP]the location is not fabulous in my opinion.[SEP]it is at the very end of robson street and not really next to anything other than the stadium (which is directly across the street.) really i was depressed when my taxi pulled up to it.[SEP]on my flight i met a woman who works for the tourism department in vancouver.[SEP]she was stunned that tripadvisor had rated hamton inn as the # 1 hotel in vancouver and embarassed!![SEP]certainly you can walk to shops and restaurants from the hotel - but nothing cute or charming is within eyesight.[SEP]the opus hotel (which ranks # 5 by tripadvisor.com) by comparison is in a cool, unique neighborhood surrounded by great restaurants and shops.[SEP]however, the opus hotel is directly next to a large and noisy construction project.[SEP]the beds were very comfortable at the hampton inn and we had no complaints in that department.[SEP]the breakfasts were not great nor was the staff very friendly.[SEP]vancouver is a beautiful city that is very unique.[SEP]the hampton inn is great if you are on a budget, however has a very motelish feeling to it.[SEP]this is not a hotel i would reccommend to someone other than for price as it is cheap.[SEP]it is definitely not upscale or luxurious and frankly neither are the clientele!
0	this hotel is definetly not a 4 star hotel.[SEP]the room was in need of some refurbishment and lacked furniture.[SEP]it's a very basic hotel in a poor location.[SEP]the staff were very unfriendly and not helpful.[SEP]the breakfast was the worst i have had.[SEP]they run out of juices, coffee, fruit, plates and the egg and bacon was cold.[SEP]there was nobody clearing the tables and people were waiting around.[SEP]i complained to the manager who was not interested and told me to contact the booking agent.
0	i was very disappointed how this hotel is marketing itself.[SEP]this is not near of metro station, you have to take a route bus to get there.[SEP]it takes about 35 - 50 minutes in a full bus and metro to get to the central.[SEP]venue is horrible, hotel is middle of some industrial area.[SEP]taxi from fiumicino to hotel was 78e.[SEP]biggest problem was location so we had to change the hotel.[SEP]also breakfast was horrible but there's a supermarket right next of the hotel where you can get something decent to eat.
0	the hotel is old & small but clean.[SEP]there is no restaurant around this hotel.it is 20 min walk to go there.[SEP](when you get back from disney and tired it is too hard to walk 20 min more).[SEP]the shopping mall looks close but it is not.[SEP]you should take a taxi or wait for free shuttle (1 pick up very day).[SEP]the free shuttle to disney is only 2 pick up every day (8 15 am & 12 45 pm).[SEP]the breakfast is just ok.[SEP]the front desk people are awesome and helpful.[SEP]overall we were n’t happy with this hotel.[SEP]thank god the power out (hotel problem), they transfer us to hilton garden inn orlando lake buena vista.this hotel is awesome, new, clean and almost luxury and it is almost same price with hampton inn and same location.[SEP]but the hotel has restaurant and bar with tasty food and very good price.[SEP]they have room service as well with great swimming area.[SEP]i really like hilton garden inn and highly recommend
0	this hotel is very cramped - lobby is small and furnishings are minimal.[SEP]there are only two elevators and one was broken for part of the time.[SEP]there were often tours that arrived and jammed the lobby area.[SEP]it only made the evelvator problem worse.[SEP]the room furnishings were limited - a long cabinet served as a closet, the bathroom had no space to put down a cosmetic bag.[SEP]the cleanliness was just ok.[SEP]when i am paying for a hotel room, i would like it to be spotless even if it isn't the most expensive hotel.[SEP]the internet service was spotty - i kept loosing the connection.[SEP]i will say that the staff was very pleasant and helpful.[SEP]the general location of the hotel also leaves a lot to be desired.[SEP]we walked around the area one evening and felt unsafe.[SEP]we thought we needed to be in this location because i was talking my daughter to visit fashion institute of technology.[SEP]in the future i would stay further uptown and take the subway to chelsea.
0	diamond in the rough i would have rated this hotel' above average' had it not been for the undesirable location.[SEP]first off the door to the hotel is located to the left of the japanese restaurant.[SEP]the lobby is nothing to write home about.[SEP]when i made my reservation online i asked for a remodeled room.[SEP]i was given room 305 and it was amazing.[SEP]everything in the room was modern and new.[SEP]triple sheeting on the comfy queen size bed, flat screen t.v, oblong leather ottoman at the foot of the beds, beautiful sage green sateen curtains, nice green chair in the corner, the bathroom was amazing.[SEP]everthing was shiny and new.[SEP]the sink in the bathroom was ultra modern and the swing out shower curtain rod gives you more room to move around.[SEP]the continental breakfast on the 8th floor was great.[SEP]the breakfast room was decorated beautifully with calming colors and pictures and wooden floor boxes.[SEP]the breakfast selection included name brand juice, tea, coffee, hot choclate, cup o noodles, fruit, yougurt, waffles, croissants, bagels, wheat   white bread.[SEP]i saw a young group of business travelers, a few couples.[SEP]i would not recommend this hotel if you are traveling with children because it's not fun explaining the triple x shops all around the area.[SEP]underground secure parking is $15 and i would not recommend using public transportation at night in this area.
0	not only did things not work: remote control for tv ; door keys ; reading lights ; air conditioner and the phone but nobody really cared.[SEP]they made you feel that you were inconveniencing them by reporting the problems.[SEP]the location is terrible if you are in ny to see anything and it is really hard to find even after you have been there a few times.[SEP]cab drivers never even heard of the street..[SEP]they say they have fitness center which is nothing more than a musty room with a couple of machines.[SEP]only place i have ever stayed in ny where they couldn't even tell you where to get a ny times.[SEP]i wouldn't stay here again if it was free.[SEP]i am writing from the hotel now and can't wait to leave tomorrow.
0	this was a one night business trip.[SEP]the entire city was booked or rediculously expensive, as nyc is these days.[SEP]booked the bently because it was one of the only hotels available.[SEP]it is a little out of the way by the river on the east side, technically midtown, but not by much.[SEP]the hotel lobby is quite chic and stylish.[SEP]the service at the front desk was friendy and excellent.[SEP]the hotel is older, so the room was not big, but it was well appointed, which brings me to the strange part of my feedback.[SEP]the hotel is actually quite nice, including very well appointed beds and linens, flat screen tv, etc..[SEP]but then the two tables in the room were beat - on and scratched, like they were leftovers from the pre - redesigned decor.[SEP]then the tiny bathroom is older fixtures, but had no plug for the drain.[SEP]just strange disconnects with the rest of the experience, which was quite nice.[SEP]if you consider the price, and don't mind the location, the hotel was a fantastic value.
0	their room is nice, clean and stylish.[SEP]service is ok if you don't ask much.[SEP]however, lobby and casino is crazy loudly, especially friday and saturday.[SEP]if you like to party, here is the place.[SEP]if you don't, better to find another hotel, or book their hrh suites because it has its own lobby.[SEP]also, location is kinda far from the street.[SEP]overall is ok for its price.
0	ok, let's get this out of the way - i only booked this hotel because the people we were traveling with had already booked it.[SEP]we got there and the hotel was clean enough, i suppose, but the rooms were freexing.[SEP]i called the front desk because the heat and air is regulated down stairs (you only have control over the force of air, not the temp) and i was told that they were not turning on the heat yet but i could use the space heater.[SEP]excuse me?[SEP]a space heater?[SEP]are you kidding me?[SEP]they were not, so we slept in a freezing room b / c space heaters do nt heat very weel and i was not going to sleep with it on all night.[SEP]the next night, i spilled something on the comforter and was told by the front desk that they did not have extras?[SEP]really?[SEP]no extras?[SEP]amazing.[SEP]the breakfast was fine and the people were nice enough, but i wouldn't stay here again.[SEP]the rooms were a tad dingy (there was a dead bug stuck on my wall and i saw a bedbug the last night we were there).[SEP]also, there is a hospital down the road and we heard sirens most every night a few times.[SEP]i'm not too fond of the location since it is in a residentail area.[SEP]nothing like looking out your wondow and seeing people in their front yards.[SEP]it's just not someplace i would recommend at all...
0	we stayed at this hotel for one night as part of our 16 day tour of italy.[SEP]it was by far one of the cleanest and most contemporary hotels on our journey.[SEP]the only " hiccup " occurred when we arrived.[SEP]apparently the front desk staff reserved a block of rooms for our group (of 30) but did not assigned them.[SEP]why it took an hour to get through that process will remain a mystery, but let's just say that a " sorry " from the staff would have gone a long way in reducing the frustration.[SEP]our room appeared to be in a newly renovated section of the hotel and it was clean, well stocked and had a fabulous shower (who doesn't appreciate a rain head shower with lots of water pressure!).[SEP]our breakfast was okay, not great, but not the worst by any means.[SEP]we were entertained by watching a " certain family " fill up their buckets and jugs with food and drink from the buffet prior to heading out for their day of adventure.[SEP]apparently they had no issue with the quality or the quantity of food offered:) overall, the experience was great and other than the location (which is no where near the " touristy " area) it is a great hotel!
0	the hotel itself was clean and had good service.[SEP]it is off the strip but within walking distance to a monorail which will take you all the way to the other end of the strip.[SEP]72 hour monorail unlimited pass was only 30 bucks and well worth it.[SEP]it also has a bus stop right outside the hotel to go to fremont which is awesome, fremont had $2 coronas and a great atmosphere.[SEP]what the hotel lacked in location, it made up with the all you can drink deals it had from 4 - 8 daily for $20 bucks (martinis, margaritas, and draft beer only but still well worth it).[SEP]the pool was nice and quiet which was nice cause you can party anywhere else in vegas obviously, the rooms were clean... there is a liquor store almost next door with good prices, only downside is the hotel does nt give you a mini fridge in the room... you have to rent one for $5 bucks a day.
0	stayed there for 2 nights.[SEP]i believe this is a relatively new hotel.[SEP]rooms and amenities are adequate.[SEP]limited tv channels, its good though that internet access is free so we resorted to that for entertainment.[SEP]good value since for an all in 150sgd, breakfast for 2 is already included and our 3yr old still eats for free.[SEP]not exactly near the tourist destinations in singapore and so you have to travel by train or bus to these places.[SEP]location feels " lonely ", nothing much to do there.[SEP]the 10 minute walk for others is fine, but not for those travelling with pre - schoolers or elders.[SEP]that's about 600 m of walk and can take longer and tiresome.[SEP]there are two bus stops nearby, might as well explore these for travel options.
0	nice room, warm welcome, nice bed, huge bathroom and shower area, clean, great view of millenium park down to buckingham fountain, shedd aquarium, etc.... (south facing).[SEP]not overly spectacular.[SEP]good room service one night at about 11 pm because no restaurants in the area were serving food that late.[SEP]we were in chicago for my partners birthday and i told the attendant on the phone who sent up a piece of cake with our room service.[SEP]very nice gesture.[SEP]the hotel is a few blocks from michigan ave and the river although it felt like a miles away from any happening area.[SEP]seemed more business than tourist although if it wasn't as warm out as it was it would have been easily walkable to most places.[SEP]next trip will stay at n.[SEP]michigan ave although not because the hotel is lacking in anything in particular but rather location, location, location.
0	the good: cheap.[SEP]the bad: everything else.[SEP]look, the fact that the place is cheap and comes with all of the basics of your typical casino goes a long way for many.[SEP]for me, well, it's a very different story.[SEP]the accommodation was booked for me by a company i was visiting while attending the sema event at the convention centre.[SEP]so i can't complain, except that we decided to stay an additional 3 nights with the booking made weeks in advance.[SEP]i didn't know how bad it would be otherwise i would have booked into the bellagio or the like.[SEP]the bottom line is that the riviera is old and needs a thorough revamp.[SEP]truly, a complete refurbish is necessary, as is a change of staff (i found most to be uninterested and poorly presented), and for the whole place to be moved a kilometres along the strip to the better part.[SEP]sorry, but the rooms were musty, contained old furnishings, were noisy (i could hear the lifts going up and down all night thanks to poor sound proofing) and lacked some of the obvious inclusions you would expect at the venetian, caesars palace etc.[SEP]location is a little off - putting as you really need to walk at least half a mile before arriving at the cleaner, well presented prestige casinos.
0	i had a free night with the rewards program, which is good, otherwise i would be much more upset.[SEP]i also attained " elite " status before this stay.[SEP]the rooms were nice, clean and had hdtv.[SEP]i had virtually no connectivity to the internet even though i was told the router was 3 rooms away from me.[SEP]i called the front desk to see if i could get another room and was told they had none available.[SEP]i hesitate to say this was a lie, but there were about 7 cars in the entire lot so.... i was force to tether to my smart phone, which burned through my data plan with surprising speed.[SEP]i now must wait until feb 8 until my data plan renews for the month.[SEP]i always stay at laquinta because of the rewards program, but if this is how you are treated when you are elite status, i'd rather go back to gold.[SEP]i usually stay at the arcadia location and will begin to do so again as i will never stay at this laquinta again.[SEP]at least at arcadia, i can check my email.[SEP]hopefully they will reach out to make this right.[SEP]if so, i will update this review
0	this is a good hotel, but it is not really in st.[SEP]germaine.[SEP]technically it is, but it really is on the border and some would probably say it is in the monparnasse area.[SEP]it is close to the vavin metro, and a bit of a short walk to another metro stop.[SEP]it is expensive, but because we traveled during the slowest month (feb.), the rate was reasonable.[SEP]the staff is friendly and the hotel is very quaint.[SEP]the pictures on its website makes it seem much larger than it is.[SEP]i wouldn't return to this hotel because i would want to be in a more centrally located area, near st.[SEP]germaine des pres for example.[SEP]for the price they charge, i would want to be in a better location.
0	with the hilton brand name, we thought it was a reasonably safe bet... but we were wrong and how![SEP]the location is straight away a big no... what you save on costs you spend on the commute by the monorail and if you chose walking well be prepared for some tired feet![SEP]second the rooms in the old tower (where most of the promotions are) are dingy and have a weird smell..[SEP]basic amenities like lockers (only available downstairs), coffee maker are missing... the entire hotel has a sense of decay and while it boasts of being the' largest hilton'... it could well be amongs the worst kept![SEP]my advice pls spend extra on a hotel on the strip and stay away from this dinosaur..[SEP]if you still go ahead, then let me add that the food and service at its coffee shop (paradise cafe) may well spell gastroenteritis!
0	stayed here recently for a business trip during new york fashion week.[SEP]there are a few plus - es about this place, but more minuses at the moment sadly.[SEP]nice that i got a room upgrade to a suite, not so nice that there isn't a proper restaurant in the hotel![SEP]had a bad experience when tried to use the bar which the staff had recommended to me for its great cocktails - it was shut for a private event, and we were rudely asked to vacate.[SEP]not cool at all![SEP]my television didn't work for two days, again not great - and one night i was kept up til 5 am with a party in the room next to mine, and the hotel staff were reluctant to shut it down.[SEP]i did indeed wonder if i was staying in a nightclub or a hotel![SEP]also, the deep downtown location means you're quite far from the main attractions of nyc.[SEP]all in all, i can see potential in this hotel, but at the moment, they definitely are not living up to the high standards of other thompson hotel properties.
0	unless you are working in the fairgrounds... nice but far from everything only neutral from my side because of the very poor location (even worse than marriott or marritim)yes it is in the city centre but in order to reach any kind of facility like restaurant or shopping area you need to walk around the festhalle complex (hotel is behind the fairgrounds and there absolutely nothing around!!!) the nearest area with shops and restaurants is 2 km away.[SEP]from the u4 station you need to walk ca.[SEP]500 m (a problem if you have heavy laguage).hotel itself is new (2005) modern and stylish decor even i'd miss a sauna or pool for a real 4 * experience.[SEP]we got it for 40 eur / night excl.[SEP]bf at priceline which is adequate (not even a real special deal as you get similar rates for low season in frankfurt around 45 eur incl.[SEP]bf) - 250 eur (normal rates) are too much for this hotel far from the scene!!conclusion: not recommended even for 40 eur / night - take a hotel closer to restaurants and shops
0	we stayed here as there was parking offered - this is actually on the street and nothing to do with the hostel so should not be used as a facility on their details.[SEP]the hotel is grimy, the kitchens are horrendous, and the girl on the desk is really rude.[SEP]the bathroom window on our floor was jammed open so people in other rooms can see you in the shower - nice![SEP]luggage storage costs $5 per bag per day.[SEP]i also am not sure that they charge right on taxes or if we were ripped off.[SEP]it's a really nasty hostel - i'd never stay here again ever and if you do you're crazy - you'd be better off sleeping in the park.[SEP]if you want somewhere for hardly anymore money you can stay at the americana inn, it's at about 38th street, is clean, better location and nice staff.[SEP]have fun in ny - it's fab!
0	for a day trip i generally would not care about my stay since i am not in the room but from the start i did not have a pleasant experience.[SEP]the location is not ideal= bad neighborhood, not that close to the subway and the subway only has two lines.[SEP]on to the room: scratched and dirty lamps, dirty mattress bathroom: dirty toilet.[SEP]and no bathroom air ventilation?[SEP]lastly front desk: not helpful, not hospitable, no agent was professionally responsive except for the asian guy in the morning checkout
0	do not let them put you in room 506.[SEP]you will hear the restaurant downstairs dish - slamming marathon until about 2 am.[SEP]when that finally stops, you'll hear the breakfast room getting ready for the hordes of loud, rude people having breakfast in the hotel.[SEP]a german women even yelled at me to go get more cups when i came out of the room, not realizing that it was an actual hotel room![SEP]signs might help.[SEP]not sure why this is even a guest room... would be better off as a storage space or secondary dining space.[SEP]the staff was great though, offered to change our rooms when we complained about the noise.[SEP]very helpful and full of knowledge about the surrounding area.[SEP]very accomodating for whatever we neeeded.[SEP]printed our boarding passes for us too.[SEP]the room was huge by european standards.[SEP]cleaning service was perfect![SEP]for the location - very convenient to termini, walking distance to many attractions.[SEP]however, i would not have felt safe walking by myself at night.[SEP]the people lurking on the streets around the hotel were very unappealing but i felt safe with the hotel security.[SEP]overall, i wouldn't stay here again.[SEP]the hotel itself was okay, but the area was very dirty, full of unsavory people, and too loud for a relaxing vacation.
0	stylish, comfortable   i stayed at le meridien cyberport in november for four nights with a friend.[SEP]in general, i have only positive comments about the hotel.[SEP]upon arrival, my friend and i were upgraded and placed on a high floor.[SEP]the check - in went quickly and the staff was friendly.[SEP]the room was stylish, modern and, by hong kong standards, fairly large.[SEP]i slept like a babe in the large, comfortable bed.[SEP]the bathroom was also large and well appointed, with a very refreshing rain - shower shower head.[SEP]i did not use the pool or gym, but did take advantage of the free internet service in the lobby.[SEP]in addition, i found the breakfast buffet well stocked with american and asian breakfast foods, plus many fresh fruits, juices and pastries.[SEP]many have commented about the disadvantageous location.[SEP]this was my second trip to kong kong and i found the location only a minor inconvenience.[SEP]most of the places that i frequented in hong kong were only a short (and cheap) cab ride away ; think 15 minutes and $7 or $8.[SEP]for me, the comfort of the room definitely outweighed the inconvenience of the location.[SEP]moreover, le meridien offers great value, with very high quality furnishings and common areas, at a price much lower than more centrally - located five star properties.[SEP]i recommend the hotel and would definitely stay again.
0	this hotel was like a cross between a nightclub and a college dorm.[SEP]all of the lighting in the hotel was either fluorescent or neon, walls painted black, club music pumping 24/7- hence, the comparison to a nightclub.[SEP]the actual room we stayed in truly looked like a dorm room w/ a king sized bed.[SEP]furniture was sparse and not well made, with the exception of the bed which was quite comfortable.[SEP]the bathroom was tiny w/ a shower only, a shower which was not enclosed i might add, which led to a wet, messy bathroom floor.[SEP]with the w, i expected minimalistic but serene luxury.[SEP]needless to say, i was quite disappointed w/ this location.
0	we chose this hotel because of previous reviews.[SEP]let me get the basic details of the hotel out of the way.[SEP]nice large room for london, clean and modern with good facilities.[SEP]the service, oh dear, rubbish, particularly at breakfast time, a half an hour wait for inedible food.[SEP]we complained but i guess they get this all the time as it just washed over the staff and management.[SEP]the location, this is what lets this hotel down for a london break, on the sunday it took us nearly 2 hours to get there from kings cross, ok there were certain tubes not running, which is nt the hotels fault, but the location impacted greatly on the travel time.[SEP]because of this we stayed in chiswick sunday night, found a great pub called the pilot by the way, and most of monday until we ventured into london to see oliver, which took 50 mins each way.[SEP]so to summarise i would avoid this hotel for a london break if you like to be amongst the buzz.
0	stayed here for 3 nights.[SEP]rooms were nice and very clean.[SEP]hotel staff was nice and courteous.[SEP]very helpful.[SEP]good breakfast buffet which was included in the cost of the hotel.[SEP]hotel gives each guest a coupon for a complimentary glass of champagne upon check in.[SEP]very limited menu in the hotel restaurant.[SEP]not alot of variety.[SEP]not the best location.[SEP]i would stay in this same hotel but at a different location within barclona.
0	i can't deny how nice this hotel is.[SEP]it's beautifully decorated, comfortable, and clean.[SEP]it's also noisy, which is to be expected in the big city.[SEP]we ended up on the side with trains, boats, cars, taxis, sirens, and everything else you can imagine, making noise all night long.[SEP]my suggestion is to ask for a room on the other side of the hotel, if you simply can't stand all that noise.[SEP]one plus to staying on that side of the hotel was we had something to look at, all the time.[SEP]we watched them off load a ship at the dock, saw trains going by, we could see the space needle in the distance and the sunset was spectacular.[SEP]make sure you have a lot of small bills on hand to tip the bellhop, the parking attendants and just about everyone else who does anything for you.[SEP]this is not your standard silver cloud, it's very upscale.[SEP]the location to the stadium can't be beat.[SEP]we did notice the bar closes early and felt rushed out the door, even though it was only 11:00 pm.[SEP]i couldn't find any posted hours of operation, so i am not sure what that was all about.
0	lousy location adjacent the main highway.[SEP]stop light outside your room makes this a perfect all night drag racing take off point.[SEP]don't bother lodging a complaint with any of the staff because they will do nothing.[SEP]the manager will not bother to contact you when you write or email him either.[SEP]this place is mediocre at best.[SEP]the hot tub and pool are always dirty and nobody seems to have any maintenance responsibilities at all.[SEP]the trees along the parking lot are diseased and many are dying.[SEP]the best thing about this place is the adjacent marie callanders.[SEP]don't fall for the " in room spa tub " that adds another $30 to your nightly bill.[SEP]the one we ended up with did not provide a " spa experience " at all so we used it once and never bothered after that time.[SEP]when i complained the folks at the front desk simply said ; " sorry ".[SEP]this place is a rip off and you could do better at a super 8 or a motel 6.
0	bad location, long walk up a hill in a scary area from the metro.[SEP]not recommended for females or men that don't want to get mugged.[SEP]rude night staff, although the man during the day was nice and did give me directions.[SEP]decent breakfast.[SEP]dark, dingy, small room with beat up furniture, saggy mattresses, and thirty year old tv's.[SEP]small, creepy bathroom with see - through frosted glass door that did not lock.[SEP]rooftop terrace that i really wanted to see, but was always closed.[SEP]staff was again rude when i asked when it was open, and i got no answer, just some mumbling and snapping.[SEP]avoid if at all possible.
0	we chose the resort based on internet photos and info, and were not disappointed.[SEP]the resort is only 2 years old so everthing was beautifully maintained and sumptious.[SEP]we stayed in a one bedroom suite w/ a kitchen lvg room and dining area which accomodated a family of four nicely.[SEP]our comfortable bedroom had a jacuzzi tub in it which was great for soaking w/ a bottle of wine, and the tv swiveled so we could watch tv in the tub.[SEP]i loved that.[SEP]also the balcony was nice for dining or morning coffee.[SEP]the on site restaurant was excellent, although service was a little slow, but great if you wanted to relax.[SEP]also the wine i found to be a little on the expensive side.[SEP]i had a massage at the beautiful and incredibly serene on site spa, even my therapist was gorgeous (wish i could mention his name)![SEP]the pool and jacuszzi was very nice, there is one for each building, so never too crowded, and the pool towels were a nice plus.[SEP]my only issue is that being new to napa, i did no know that the vinewyards were a good 25 mins from this location, so the driving got old after a while.[SEP]next time i will stay in st.[SEP]helena, where most of the action is, and is excrutiatingly charming.
0	the bad= location was a bit out of the way, lobby was super smoky and stinky.[SEP]the hotel overall was nothing to rave about, but the price was fair.[SEP]the good= price, trolley swings by at random intervals so you don't need to take a cab, everything you need is in the hotel somewhere, even a little shopping mall area![SEP]lots of different food choices.[SEP]we ate at the japanese restaurant one night... yummy![SEP]we also caught the impersonators show and checked out the tower, which were both pretty cool.[SEP]you get a discount for the show if you're a hotel guest.[SEP]the best part of our hotel we discovered on the last night of our trip.... pollyesters![SEP]this nightclub was fun and unique.[SEP]we all chipped in $20 each and got a vip table with bottle service... unlimited drinks![SEP]the club has a 70's room, 80's room, 90's room, and 2000's with appropriate decor and music for each.[SEP]it was quite unique![SEP]we loved hopping from the disco music to pop and back again.[SEP]so, long story short... if i ever get back to vegas, i would not stay at the stratosphere again, but i would pay a visit!
0	i stayed at the biltmore july 2010.[SEP]from the get go it was a nightmare.[SEP]my best friend arrived in la before i did and the hotel would not let her check in w out pying for a $100 " incidental fee " even tho she told the hotel i was in transit to the hotel.[SEP]she waited 4 hours before she was able to check in!!![SEP]when i arrived i was told they were out of double beds.[SEP]so 2 girls had to share a king bed![SEP]the next day we asked to move and they claimed they still were out.[SEP]however, we met 2 guys who had checked in 2 days after us who got a double bed room!![SEP]i was very upset.[SEP]also parking $30 per day?!!![SEP]the hotel is also in a bad location, around the corner from skid row.[SEP]not close to anything exciting.[SEP]the room is a good size, bathroom a lil old.[SEP]hotel needs updating.[SEP]would not stay again
0	the people at the front desk, espacially mark and jessica were exceptional.[SEP]first, the room was clean and tidy, equipped with a microwave, dishwasher, fridge, tv, radio, cd player etc.[SEP]in addition, there was a supermarket across the street, so preparing meals was extremely convenient.[SEP]they built with us plans for the day in berlin and explained exactly, when, how and ways to get to each location..[SEP]there is a supermarket over the street.[SEP]you can also buy breakfast at the hotel.[SEP]the hotel somewhat away from some main tourist sites.[SEP]but take the bus 109 from the olivaer platz stop a few minutes away on kurfurstendam to bahnhof zoologischer garten.[SEP]from there there is easy transport to all the main areas of berlin.[SEP]public transport is efficient and cheap.[SEP]the fact that the hotel was located about 400 m from a u - bahn station which doesn't lead to the main stations in town.[SEP]so we had to take the bus instead, and then switch to the u - bahn.[SEP]in addition, the shower isn't completely sealed, meaning that water might spill out if you are not paying attention.[SEP]other than that - perfect the hotel claimed they are not responsible for people who smoke in no smoking rooms so i guess we are.
0	you're just one of the many cattle coming through the door.[SEP]customer service is unheard of.[SEP]staff was very rude which is the main reason i'm giving it only one star.[SEP]where do they hire these people?![SEP]room wasn't bad, very standard.[SEP]pools were overcrowded and could never find any room to sit.[SEP]fitness room is a joke with only some cardio machines, what about weights?[SEP]and other machines?[SEP]location isn't the best as it sits on one end of the strip and we were hoping for something right in the middle.[SEP]the only good thing about this place is the wonderful array of restaurants they have.[SEP]other than that, don't bother.
0	stayed for 2 nights, superior double, check in: 3pm, check out: 12pm negetive: rooms: really small.... 10 ft x 10ft... some of the rooms have no windows.[SEP]bath: 4 ft x 6 ft, no shower curtains cleanliness: bed spread / quilits / pillows torn and with stains!![SEP]service: breakfast served between 7 to 11.[SEP]fixed menu, they have 3 - 4 options.[SEP]cupons provided at check in for breakfast.[SEP]no refills for coffee or tea or juice or food.[SEP]need to pay extra.[SEP]staff not so friendly.[SEP]treat you like they are doing a favour on you![SEP]corridors get noisy and can be easily heard in the night.[SEP]positive: location: 5minutes walks from lavender mrt (but seems to be a red light area) luggage room available.[SEP]internet: s$1 for 15minutes, the computers are slow and have got bugs![SEP]suggestions: pay little more and move to a better location
0	this holiday inn express failed to meet the quality one normally finds at a holiday inn express.[SEP]the location is questionable at best.[SEP]it is surrounded by auto repair shops and a self - storage facility.[SEP]while in the room you could hear street traffic.[SEP]there were stains on the sheets.[SEP]the room smelled very musty.[SEP]the breakfast area needed a good cleaning.[SEP]the garbage from the breakfast area was piled up on a cart at the front door of the breakfast area.[SEP]parking is very tight.[SEP]large cars and pick - up trucks had a difficult time parking.[SEP]the staff were very polite and professional.
0	before my trip i was very nervous about staying at this hotel because of the reviews i read about it's room size, location, and customer service.[SEP]my husband and i just got back from last night after a two night stay and to be honest, i wasn't too pleased.[SEP]we were waiting in line to be checked in and a young couple walked up and cut in front of us.[SEP]the lady at the front desk saw this but ignored the situation and helped them before us.[SEP]i was very upset but i didn't do anything because we were there on our anniversary and didn't want to start the trip with a bad vibe.[SEP]our room was dark and small but clean.[SEP]our one small window view was blocked by the back of an old scary church.[SEP]the bathroom was small just enough for one person at a time.[SEP]the hotel was at a safe and nice location but far from most attractions (several blocks to get to places).[SEP]the two good things about this hotel were the door / bell men and the asian guy at the front desk.[SEP]they were very helpful and went out of their way to assist us.[SEP]would i stay at this hotel again?[SEP]no.
0	the serrano is a lovely old hotel billed as being " in the theatre district " of san francisco.[SEP]the hotel itself was very nice.[SEP]interesting old world feel to the lobby.[SEP]very helpful staff.[SEP]extremely spacious rooms.[SEP]nice added touch is the afternoon wine tasting.[SEP]however, the location, while only 3 blocks from union square, appeared to be a little iffy.[SEP]the theatres i saw were a couple of blocks away and appeared dark.[SEP]maybe the area is better when shows are playing.[SEP]the other downside was the restaurant at breakfast.[SEP]it didn't open until 8 am on the weekends.[SEP]not good for a group trying to catch a tour bus at 8:15![SEP]the one day we were able to eat there, it was extremely slow with one waitress constantly telling us " i'm not the only server " whenever we would ask for something.[SEP]breakfast food was average at best.[SEP]overall, it was a good hotel with a spacious room and very comfortable bed.[SEP]pluses do outweigh the minuses.
0	location - close to aiport but not nice area.[SEP]rooms - very tired but clean.[SEP]staff - helpful.[SEP]parking - hotel charges $12 per day.[SEP]we stayed here having had good experiences at other holiday inns throughout california.[SEP]it was a decent rate, we paid $119 plus tax and although i wasn't expecting luxury i did expect a decent night sleep which i didn't get.[SEP]tip, make sure if you stay here you ask for a room on the other side from the hotel entrance.[SEP]the noise was terrible at the front of the hotel.[SEP]if you have your own car, i would stay at the doubletree, el segundo instead.[SEP]much nicer hotel and area and no noise!
0	the hotel is aparently the largest hotel in europe.[SEP]our room was on the large side.[SEP]the bathroom was really nice.[SEP]no kettle or tea making facilities.[SEP]just water in the mini - bar![SEP]the room service is crazy prices.... 8 euros for soup... 15 euros for a sandwich![SEP]breakfast is around 19 euros![SEP]we walked to the back of the hotel and found a liitle place and paid 18 euros for 3 people![SEP]the car park is 21 euros for 7 to 24 hours.[SEP]which i feel is very expensive.[SEP]the location is right on the motorway and really difficult to find, even with a sat nav![SEP]our room had free wifi which was great.[SEP]we paid 110 euros for 1 triple room for 1 night, which is not so god value in my opinion, but had little option because we had to be at this hotel.
0	this hotel's location so close to the airport creates way too much noise.[SEP]being on the waterfront with all the beautiful boats was nice, and the resort is physically attractive, but it is isolated from the city, and the constant airplane noise was really intrusive.[SEP]flights began before dawn, waking my spouse ; i woke at 7:30 when the hotel staff began leaf - blowing in the parking lot under our window.[SEP]the lobby restaurant in the east tower had fine views, but their prices were steep and the food was good but not great.[SEP]the breakfast buffet was much better than dinner and offered some unusual touches: cheese blintzes and a multi - layered egg torta with several fillings.[SEP]good stuff.[SEP]the staircase between floors was ugly and institutional, making it easy to opt for the elevator, even to go down just a single flight to my son's room.[SEP]it's a shame they are stuck with this mixed bag of a location: a pretty marina and swimming pools, but an ugly, noisy airport right across the way.
0	apart from seeing the elevators where arnie galloped the horse and john malkovich tried to kill the president, there is nothing to recommend this hotel.[SEP]our experience was simply awful.[SEP]horrid location.[SEP]right in the middle of downtown, nothing around except the library which is where we used to go for lunch as there is nothing else around.[SEP]very seedy and quite unsafe after working hours.[SEP]hotel service non - existent.[SEP]our room hadn't been made up.[SEP]we rang over the phone but couldn't get anyone to do anything about it.[SEP]eventually we had to go down to the lobby and ask for another room as no maid was available to make it up.[SEP]this after a long transpacific flight.[SEP]staff were not only unhelpful, they were uninterested.[SEP]room very small.[SEP]bathroom quite nice.[SEP]bed good.[SEP]other than that, unremarkable.[SEP]breakfast reasonable for standard buffet.[SEP]atrium was very confusing, hard to navigate - we ended up getting lost quite a few times trying to find a particular store on the various levels.[SEP]a lot of stores seemed closed when they should have been open.[SEP]architecture is not something i take much notice of when staying, but this one you can't help.[SEP]towering concrete columns and an organic kind of layout which must have looked good on the plans, but made it very difficult to find your way about.[SEP]the outside elevators are exactly as in the movies.[SEP]fun for the first couple of times, then you don't notice.[SEP]bottom line: not a pleasant experience.[SEP]stay somewhere else.
0	my husband and i were in dallas for just a couple of nights for a concert at the house of blues.[SEP]we got a reasonable rate on priceline, but after reading all of the horrible reviews, we were terrified of what we would find.[SEP]first of all, this hotel is ridiculously huge, and the set - up is kind of confusing.[SEP]there were people all over, attending conferences.[SEP]at check - in, the nice man working the front desk upgraded us to what we think was a king suite.[SEP]i think it was one of the newly remodeled rooms that was made from 2 rooms into 1 bigger one.[SEP]the room itself was nice (pictures posted).[SEP]however, there was a terrible smell when you go off the elevator in the hallway.[SEP]thankfully, our room still was okay.[SEP]the location of this hotel is okay as it is very close to the light rail / trains, but within walking distance, there isn't really anything going on as far as bars / restaurants.[SEP]it was very quiet and it almost seemed like the city was empty.[SEP]we ended up going to the west village during one day for a little shopping and lunch, and then victory park for the hob concert.[SEP]both were a little more lively.
0	the resort is 45 min away and the hotel shuttle is not free.[SEP]it's $60 or $75 per person.[SEP]aside from this, the hotel is located in a random location where there is nothing around.[SEP]so you are forced to eat all of your meals (which are way overpriced) at the resort.[SEP]the food is not bad but it's not worth the hefty price either.[SEP]additionally every chance they get they rob you.[SEP]they charged us $7 for iced tea with no liquor, when we complained they adjusted it, they charged us $26 for a quesadilla, when we complained they adjusted it.[SEP]and they the rooms are extremely small and very humble.[SEP]nothing at all to go crazy for.[SEP]my husband left his $400 ipod on the hotel bed and it was stolen.[SEP]the hotel referred me to their insurance company who denied the claim saying that unless it was in the safe they are not liable.[SEP]the hotel was made aware that we were on our honeymoon and they did nothing to make our trip special.[SEP]in fact we were charged $150 per day to upgrade to a room with a beach view and the resort wasnâ€ ™ t even crowded.
0	stayed at the clarion prior to embarking on a cruise from the port of new orleans.[SEP]arrived in nola too early to check in, but hotel staff were great - offered to secure our luggage and allowed us to park in their lot while we waiting to check in.[SEP]location was only disappointment - walkable to bourbon street and the french quarter, but had to walk through a couple of blocks that were less than desireable to get there.[SEP]would not walk alone.[SEP]we requested a queen non smoking bed.[SEP]room was very small - had everything we needed, but no room to spare at all![SEP]bathroom was a good size - no tub, but stand up shower was fine for us.[SEP]breakfast was ok - basic waffles, pastries, cereal and biscuits and so - called gravy.[SEP]overall this was a good hotel for the money.[SEP]we'll probably stay there again.
0	pros: extremely friendly staff, clean rooms, ok size for parisian standards, large bathroom, free wifi cons: not best location for sightseeing, breakfast is not included and expensive, some noise at night from street and corridor.[SEP]nearest decent bakery is a 10 min walk away other: situated halfway between porte dauphine and porte maillot metro stations, about 10 mins walk to either one.[SEP]air france bus line 2 also stops at porte maillot if you're going to / from the airport.[SEP]closest major site is the arc de triomphe / champs elysees, other sites will require a metro ride.[SEP]overall ok hotel but might not recommend to friends only because of the location.[SEP]probably good for a business hotel as there seems to be a trade or convention centre of some sort in porte maillot
0	2nd trip to rome so knew where to book, location is fantastic.[SEP]you can end up in a building around the corner so state you want to stay in the main hotel with 24hr reception.[SEP]we went in november so it was quiet, very small bar was souless.[SEP]same area used for breakfast (6 tables)so a short wait to be seated (be warned mind this was november) the shower was naff, smallest i have ever encountered so if you are over 5' 6 " and 13st you will not fit in it -biggest let down really.[SEP]breakfast was basic and due to lack of room was all non warm / hot food.[SEP]if your the right size book room only -good value then as the 4 star next door is 165eurosprpn.[SEP]remember it's good points, it is clean, safe and very central!

0	i stayed at the avalon in january with a couple of friends.[SEP]the hotel was okay and it was a good price for new york.[SEP]the rooms were really small but that's to be expected.[SEP]we had two rooms and one room was fine but the other smelled of mildew.[SEP]when we discovered that the smelll was coming from the shower curtain in the bathroom, we asked the front desk if we could have it changed.[SEP]they said that they would rectify the situation while we were out for dinner.[SEP]when we returned to the room, some sort of heavily perfumed deodorizer had been sprayed in the bathroom but the shower curtain had not been changed.[SEP]when the sickening perfume smell wore off, the mildew odour was back.[SEP]the location of the hotel was not the greatest (murray hill) but it was close to the subway.[SEP]there really weren't a lot of options for dinner nearby or any place we could find to grab a nightcap.[SEP]the hotel bar closes quite early.
0	the hotel had extra taxes on top of the state tax, also extra taxes on parking.[SEP]then on top of all the extra taxes there was the the state tax.[SEP]very unexplainable.[SEP]for room service there was an extra charge for each plate.[SEP]but the same place in the hotel restaurant did not have the extra charge.[SEP]so a soup and sandwich would be an extra $3.50 for each plate.[SEP]then mandatory room service tax, and then marketing tax, then the hst, which is the state tax.[SEP]i've never seen this anywhere ealse.[SEP]we had to pay $15 a day for slower than dial up internet.[SEP]the bath tub had long black hair in it.[SEP]the blanket was slippery, and kept falling off the bed.[SEP]the pillow was too hard and big.[SEP]the ambulance was going all night due the location it was central but also very busy at night.[SEP]the staff were not welcoming or friendly at all.[SEP]the building is very old, it need some work, specially the elevator.[SEP]the wall centre across the street, had better beds, free bottle water, 2 free coffees and tea, decaf and caffeinated.[SEP]free internet.[SEP]no extra charge for delivering room service.[SEP]and no hidden extra taxes.[SEP]just one, hst.[SEP]the pool was dirty and too much smell.[SEP]also, the changing rooms were one floor up, so after getting wet in the pool we had to walk in the cold hallways to the changing room.[SEP]i must say this again, the ambulance and fire trucks go 24 hours.
0	when you think w you imagine design, urban, trendy and an experience.[SEP]this w caters more to camper / surfer types.[SEP]the staff is much too familiar and lax, the decor has a garage sale quality and seems unfinished, and no bell / valet is ever to be found.[SEP]the pool is very small and has only 4 chairs, wifi is free in the lobby but the signal is always low.[SEP]the lobby music was merengue 24/7.[SEP]the location leaves much to be desired.[SEP]the room itself is comfortable but the decor is very hamptons / boat.[SEP]don't recommend.
0	we stayed for 5 nights from jan.[SEP]1 - 6.[SEP]we had to wait until 3:30 to check in, but we did get a room on 43rd floor with great views.[SEP]there is a very modern feel to the room.[SEP]bed was extremely comfortable, and the blackout shades allowed for sleeping in very late without the sun waking us up.[SEP]the refrigerator didn't work and the minibar wasn't stocked, but a person from maintenance brought us up the drinks we requested on the house to make up for minibar being empty.[SEP]we only got the free bottles of water once during the entire stay despite having evening turndown service at least three times.[SEP]service from housekeeping (emanuel) and maintenance (harris) were very helpful when i became ill during the stay from some bad food one night.[SEP]housekeeping during the day though seemed spotty - our shampoo, conditioner, soap, etc.[SEP]weren't always restocked.[SEP]bath salts appeared on our 3rd night but weren't replaced.[SEP]these are things that i expect will be ironed out over time.[SEP]in general though the attitude of most of the staff seemed to be very helpful.[SEP]location isn't ideal.[SEP]we're still debating if we'd stay here again because of location - in general loved the room but the location makes it difficult to get around.
0	i used to live in dubai, and we would go to this hotel for its great restaurants.[SEP]having moved from dubai and going back on a business trip, i chose to stay here.[SEP]i have never had a bad experience with a jw marriott.[SEP]they have always been top quality.[SEP]this hotel is of this top quality.[SEP]the restaurants are great.[SEP]the executive lounge is good.[SEP]the service is good.[SEP]my executive room was very large.[SEP]with our corporate rate, the hotel is a great value.[SEP]my only complaint is that this hotel is located in deira.[SEP]this is no longer the happening part of dubai and is a bit congested.[SEP]the gym is just ok.[SEP]if location is not critical to you, this is a good hotel.[SEP]if location is important, stay at one of dubai's many other fine hotels.
0	this holiday inn express is not one i would recommend for people going to rome for a vacation.[SEP]the reception staff is not friendly nor overly helpful.[SEP]the location is not central to anything and it located right next to the train yard, so there is train noise all through the night.[SEP]the metro underground station is about 4 blocks away and there is no complimentary transportation nor bellman service.[SEP]the corridor hallway walls are void of any decoration or pictures and the hallway floors either haven't been washed in a long time or have puddles of water condensation from the overhead air conditioning units.[SEP]the free breakfast is above average, but do be careful as if they make a cappacino or speciality hot drink, you will be charged![SEP]you are charged for internet service and there is a minimal business center (one desktop pc and printer).[SEP]we will not be returning.
0	booked in, reception staff rude and uninterested, room shabby small, smelly, dirty.[SEP]boxes 3 high packed our corridor (nice and safe in a fire).[SEP]after a terrible nights sleep booked out and found a proper hotel.[SEP]i ve stayed in some hotels in my life but this takes the biscuit.[SEP]i would say this hotel is only good for 1 - 2 nights very budget accomodation for students.[SEP]its location is mentioned many times by people, mcdonalds on time square is clean and warm, and the staff are polite.[SEP]so please believe me, its a very low quality budget hotel, which does have a place in the market, but please do nt spoil a nice holiday by booking this hotel.
0	this place is basically on par with a room in a ymca in 1962.[SEP]the carpet is very old and smelly.[SEP]smells of cigarette smoke everywhere.[SEP]internet costs extra and works only a couple hours a day.[SEP]5 - 10 minute waits for elevators, which sometimes just skip your floor.[SEP]doors that don't close.[SEP]exposed electrical wiring.[SEP]old dirty furniture.[SEP]heat a / c that is so loud you can't sleep, and it doesn't work.[SEP]staff who are ill - informed and overworked.[SEP]location several miles from downtown.[SEP]the only thing good was that the manager really tried to do his best.[SEP]but this place is just beyond the pale.[SEP]and it is nice to have a kitchen.[SEP]i wouldn't mind so much if there were truth in advertising.[SEP]it should have one star, and be clear that it is far from downtown.[SEP]then you would know what you were getting into.[SEP]but this is not the case.[SEP]the people who gave this inn 5 stars can not possibly be serious.
0	stayed at the holiday inn for 2 nights on my way to bali.[SEP]having got off a 12 hour flight from london at 730 am i was wondering whehter i would get an early check in as i turned up at around 9 am and hoped for the best.[SEP]being a priority club member seemed to do the trick and i was in my room in no time which was a nice touch from holiday inn.[SEP]the hotel has a quite spectacular atrium reception and looks absolutely immaculate.[SEP]got to the room and the room size was very good and the room and bathroom was spotless the tv in the room was a good size and had all the channels you could want.[SEP]the location of the hotel is ok but not spectacular as its a bit out of the way from the centre and walking in singapore when it is humid is no joke but taxis are plentiful and cheap.[SEP]service in the restaurants and bar in this hotel are very good and as in most hotels in singapore the do a happy hour from 5pm until 9pm as any other times the drinks are quite expensive otherwise.[SEP]the hotel was a 15 min walk from clarke quay overlooking singapore river and had plenty of bars and restaurants for all budgets and tastes and was open until the early hours.[SEP]overall the hotel was fair value for singapore but the location was a little out of the way
0	what a great time we had.[SEP]took the kids on a 4 day trip and were somewhat skeptical of the vegas scene.[SEP]but after checking out the pools at mandalay the vacation was on.[SEP]the kids were pumped to get in the waves.[SEP]looked forward to cruising around in the lazy river.[SEP]could not wait to get a great view of the strip and a sweet stay in the suite.[SEP]as soon as we got there it was awesome.[SEP]the front desk guy -- really worked with us -- got us an upgraded v suite same price and on the 27th floor.[SEP]when the kids opened the door they were just excited as all get out.[SEP]room was awesome, 2 bathrooms, and enough tv's for all of us.[SEP]the pools were awesome as expected and the view was super.[SEP]the only draw back to this hotel is the location, for gambling around the strip, its not the best, but taking cabs is easy.[SEP]i did nt say they were cheap or safe, but they were easy to get.[SEP]i m not a vip member and did nt really spend a lot of money in the casino, but i was polite and patient and the staff treated me better than a vip.[SEP]thank you!![SEP]this is a place i will try and get back to as soon as i can.
0	room is small and old.[SEP]dirty carpet.[SEP]room smelled like some parfumy..[SEP]like those powder you put on the carpet before vacuming.[SEP]lots of mold on the shower wall.[SEP]bathroom so small you can hardly move.[SEP]avoid this hotel.[SEP]you'll find better hotel for the same price at better location.
0	if you are looking for a relatively inexpensive place to stay in london this is the hotel of choice.[SEP]not sure how safe neighborhood is.[SEP]when you enter the hotel lobby there is a security gate between you and the receptionist.[SEP]the room was dirty, smelt like cigarettes.[SEP]this location is far from the center of london.[SEP]the 12 minutes walk from hotel to tube requires walking through local neighborhood.
0	a great location for the tourist trap that is darwin harbour but not so good for the cbd (central business district).[SEP]this hotel has one very serious let - down ; whilst the suites are spacious, they are very very tired.[SEP]i stayed here with a colleague so i got to see two very different 1 bed suites.[SEP]mine was well layed out however 2 of the three windows were in the bedroom so the living and kitchen areas were very gloomy which, combined with the tired look made the room feel very depressing.[SEP]my colleagues room had very strange layout and there was a strong stale tobacco smell in the bathroom coming from elsewhere in the building, plus his view was of an internal courtyard - not very appealing.[SEP]that being said, this hotel would be ok for a short weekend break where the only need is for a bed to sleep in, but as a hotel to live and work out of for a week this was so bad we moved to another radisson property (the radisson blu, sydney harbour - way better!).[SEP]the breakfast buffet was ok, but again not to the normal high standard that i expect from the chain.[SEP]the outstanding plus was the staff, they could not have been more professional.
0	this is a wonderful nn hotel which provides great value for the price.[SEP]we were able to stay in one of the rooms on the top floor which was amazing.[SEP]there is a large king size bed with a huge washroom complete with a jetted tub and two rain showers.[SEP]the room also has a large patio with a table for dining and lounging.[SEP]the only downside to this hotel is the location.[SEP]although it is still quite central, it is a little bit out of the way.[SEP]this is easily overlooked though if you can get one of those top rooms.
0	we first stayed in sydney at the start of our visit to australia at the rendezvous hotel, in the historic district and thoroughly enjoyed it.[SEP]great location, clean, bright, well appointed rooms.[SEP]we thought when we returned for a night prior to our flight out, we'd try another hotel, so we booked one night at the holiday inn darling harbour.[SEP]what a disappointment across the board![SEP]even my kids were depressed by the state of this hotel, with its dark, dingy hallways.[SEP]the supposed workout room and " hot tub " was enough to make you feel ill just walking into it, which you had to do through the filthy laundry room.[SEP]the rooms themselves are well appointed, though the funky light system using the key card was annoying.[SEP]however, the windows allow little or no light and the schlept through the odd lobby, hotel and hallways made it sad experience.[SEP]had we been planning to stay more than one night, we would have definitely changed hotels.[SEP]the key card for everything made us feel like we were in a lock down facility and that the neighborhood was really questionable.[SEP]pay the extra money and stay in the rocks area.
0	the rooms are very good.[SEP]however, f&b in this location leaves much to be desired.[SEP]the breakfast is expensive.[SEP]shuttle bus to hong kong mtr station can get full very fast if you are not down there early.[SEP]this includes the shuttle to ocean park.[SEP]for going downtown, take the lift down to the street level (not hotel lobby) and take kmb 75 to pedder st stop.[SEP]a central mtr entrance is located there.[SEP]missed the shuttle back and we attempted to take a kmb night express bus back.[SEP]with the tired children we gave in to taking a taxi.[SEP]costs us hkd80 from hong kong mtr station.[SEP]doesn't matter if you go by pok fu lam or the aberdeen tunnel.[SEP]until the new wong chuk hang mtr station is completed, guest better concede to taking kmb 75 to central or taxis.[SEP]a choice hotel if ocean park is your main objective with kids.[SEP]the shuttle bus service brings you there for the opening of the park at 0930 and the shuttle bus also brings you back when the park closes at 2100.
0	when traveling to san diego i would steer clear of this hotel.[SEP]it is located off the freeway and it hasn't been updated in years.[SEP]almost everything about this hotel was depressing, the rooms were small and dark and looked out to the parking lot.[SEP]the room was clean but in desperate need of an update and overhaul.[SEP]it was the type of room you sleep in but don't want to spend any other time in.[SEP]the hotel was fairly near old town, just a quick trolley ride away but it is located in a very inconvenient location when trying to access the downtown or other districts of the city.[SEP]i felt very isolated and pretty much stuck at the hotel.[SEP]you can take the nearby trolley but it took us almost an hour with two transfers to reach the downtown.[SEP]cab fare to reach downtown was $20 each way.[SEP]the only upside was that the hotel has a decent pool and hot tub and it was nice to relax there.
0	this hotel is next door to safeco field and football stadium.[SEP]also only a few blocks from amtrack station.[SEP]we stayed here on our return trip from vancouver and walked from the amtrack station to the silver cloud.[SEP]the hotel is very nice and has newly remodeled rooms.[SEP]our room was on the small side, but had a web bar area with a granite counter.[SEP]i could not give 5 stars because the view of seattle and the location is not great.[SEP]it is near the waterfront, but in a very industrial area.[SEP]on the other hand, there is a free shuttle in a very comfortable van that will pick up and drop off to any touristy area downtown.[SEP]we saved so much on cabs / buses![SEP]it was like having a personal driver![SEP]overall for the price (we got it on priceline), it was worth it.[SEP]the pool is on the roof and the view from there is not great, but if you are looking for a clean, comfortable place to stay without spending a small fortune, i would definetly recommend it.[SEP]the service was tops![SEP]the restaurant had great burgers![SEP]i think during baseball and football games, the prices at this hotel may be higher.
0	we really enjoyed this small hotel.[SEP]it is spotless, the staff are great, breakfasts lovely and our room, whilst not large, was light and had a window overlooking the internal courtyard.[SEP]it is very well priced for what is on offer![SEP]the only negative really is it's location.[SEP]fairly close to gare de l'est, but in an are surrounded by what i initially thought were prostitutes, only to find they were simply people visiting all the hair dressing and nail salons - which are genuine!![SEP]would we stay there again?[SEP]probably.
0	i don't ever write reviews but my experience with this hotel was so incredibly frustrating, that i am going to take a moment and let you all know.[SEP]from the beginning, the hospitality and courteousness of the hotel was lacking.[SEP]when we were checking in the front desk clerk, who happened to be the manager, was very rude and a poor reflection of their service.[SEP]our rooms were not ready, even though it was past check in time, so we had to wait.... and wait.........[SEP]and wait.[SEP]we didn't get our room until after 5:30pm![SEP]they lied about calling us to tell us our rooms were ready and they had tried to make it seem like it was our fault.[SEP]secondly, there was curly hair in the supposedly cleaned bed.... gross!!![SEP]they only had 2 towels in the bathroom, so when we called for new towels they didn't deliver them until 2.5 hours later.[SEP]the pictures of the hotel do not depict the actual image of the place.[SEP]it is old, unkept, and their lagoon / pond is full of mildew and debris.[SEP]lastly, they charge you $22 a night for parking, which you are forced to do since there are no other places that you can park due to the location of the place.[SEP]again i personally will never stay at this place again.
0	we booked directly with the hotel.[SEP]or room was not ready at the " express check - in " at the airport and when we arrived at the hotel, they tried to give us a smoking room although we had requested non - smoking.[SEP]the room decor was nice, but i think the exterior and casino decor is outdated.[SEP]the location is ok, but definitely not central.[SEP]we found the food and entertainment in side the casino to be nothing to write home about.[SEP]i would stay at a nicer hotel in the center of the strip if i went again.
0	i am a loyal four seasons customer and was very excited to have the chain come back to seattle after many years of absence.[SEP]unfortunately, my first stay negated my excitement.[SEP]the hotel is new and the rooms are reasonably nice and brand new, but not really up to four seasons standards.[SEP]the furniture is light maple and the carpets are very bright.[SEP]the entire place felt like it was built by high end ikea.[SEP]it doesn't look or feel luxurious.[SEP]the other big problem is the location and the view.[SEP]i paid extra for a waterview room, but it was dominated by a view of two big smokestacks and a construction site.[SEP]seattle has amazing water views but this hotel isn't situated in a spot that has them.[SEP]in fact, it is still in a transitional neighborhood with a handful of peep shows and x rates theaters only a block away.[SEP]the worst part of my stay, however, was my inability to take a normal shower.[SEP]the water pressure in the shower was the lowest i've experienced in north america.[SEP]i couldn't wash my hair and could barely get the soap off my body.[SEP]upon checkout i emailed the manager and he told me that the " water pressure in my room was consistent with the hotel standard.[SEP]" i don't know what that means but it is not connsistent with any other place and certainly not a four seasons.[SEP]seattle has great luxury hotel choices in hotel 1000 and the new pan pacific.[SEP]there is no reason at all to put up with the shortcomings of this four seasons.
0	inconvenient location and parking the room was nice, we didn't even notice the construction.[SEP]i have no complaints with the hotel itself.[SEP]i had many complaints with finding the parking garage, which is actually in another hotel.[SEP]the hotel is on a one - way street, which is very very busy, and i held my breath every time we slowed down to turn into the driveway, because i was sure someone was going to run over us.[SEP]the entrance is nowhere near the driveway or garage, and you have to carry your luggage a loooong way.[SEP]i will not be staying here again.
0	so the hilton overall is a very nice hotel.[SEP]the rooms were clean and soundproof so we had a relaxing nights sleep.[SEP]the beds were also very comfortable.[SEP]the only qualms i had with the hotel was the location and lack of casino in the lobby.[SEP]you would have to venture out to find a casino and the hotel is on the end of the strip.[SEP]the cab ride does cost a pretty penny to get to the main areas.[SEP]otherwise, i don't think i'd book here again based on location.[SEP]the hotel itself however is a good deal.
0	our stay here was as expected.[SEP]the room was clean, large, bathroom was nice, check in was pleasant.[SEP]the location is not the best, but the parking lot is fenced in.[SEP]for the price, its definitely worth it for how close you are to downtown.[SEP]the front desk has numbers for taxi service.[SEP]we were in town for the sugar bowl at the superdome, and stayed here one night.[SEP]we were able to order domino's pizza as well and they delivered to the front desk.[SEP]my husband had no issues going to get it.[SEP]i would not recommend walking around the property at night, but for a place to lay your head during travels, its well suited.[SEP]i would stay here again, if i were staying on a budget.[SEP]next time, i hope to be able to stay longer and down on bourbon st.[SEP]the trick with the showers and hot water are to start your shower water early, let it run for about 15 mins, and then you have a very hot shower.[SEP]the abandoned building we looked at from our window was interesting, but, just part of the rebuilding from katrina.
0	we booked two rooms with priceline at very short notice and i donâ€ ™ t think we would have stayed at this location if we wished to visit downtown seattle.[SEP]there is, however, a free shuttle bus that stops at all the major downtown sights and the drivers are very friendly and knowledgeable which makes up for the location.[SEP]we had some trouble while at the hotel ; we were refused two rooms together at check - in.[SEP]we took one room and then came back and spoke to another member of staff who booked us to the room next door without a problem.[SEP]however, when we returned to the hotel that evening one of our rooms had been let to somebody else.[SEP]we walked into a room with other guestâ€ ™ s personal effects all over the place.[SEP]the duty manager clearly had no idea what had gone wrong but found us another room.[SEP]the following day the reception desk sent the shuttle bus to the wrong place to pick us up downtown, leaving us stood around for 40 minutes.[SEP]in conclusion, an ok hotel in not a great location and with some customer service issues.
0	the staff is amazing here, though the location is sub par.[SEP]my room was not ready when i arrived, so they arranged for me to stay at a 3 star hotel across the street for the first night.[SEP]the manager even helped me carry my luggage and walked me over there.[SEP]rooms are very clean.[SEP]it even has a mini fridge!![SEP]breakfast room is also very nice, with an outdoor wing.
0	the harbor court is a charming little joint on the embarcadero with great views and some nice little touches.[SEP]upon arrival we noted that the " valet " service wasn't really well defined and later discovered that the bellmen were doing double duty.[SEP]check in was quick and they accommodated our request for early check in (10:30a).[SEP]valet for overnight seemed excessive at $38.[SEP]the wine and beer cordial in the evening was nice, the wines were tasty and not just cheap swill and the beer was sierra nevada on tap.[SEP]the room was small, but not too cramped, similar to nyc hotels.[SEP]it had an ipod player on the clock radio and a flat screen lcd on the wall.[SEP]the lcd was not tuned correctly for the aspect ratio and they should either get an hd signal or stretch the 4:3 picture.[SEP]nothing worse than watching a square picture on a rectangular screen.[SEP]the bed was a tad on the hard side, any harder and i would say too uncomfortable for a good night sleep.[SEP]check out was quick and they held our bags while we spent the afternoon in the city.[SEP]staff was courteous, kind, and helpful.[SEP]location was nice, but they really weren't near much besides market st.[SEP]and the embarcadero.[SEP]probably 1 mile west to fishermans wharf, 1 mile east to at&t park.
0	firstly, the hotel's description is deceptive - hotel is in chinatown and not soho ; there is a business center but it is not complimentary.[SEP]secondly, the hotel places a' holding amount' on your credit card, as well as charging the amount of your stay to your credit card.[SEP]in my case, they held $300 and also charged the amount of my stay which was $1620 (for 10 days).[SEP]i checked out 5 days ago and still have not received the $300 holding amount back.[SEP]extremely dissatisfied with this hotel.[SEP]the staff are very unfriendly and abrupt.[SEP]i have now moved to a midtown hotel with a better reputation, location, and a fridge!
0	finnaly getting around to writing my review.[SEP]i stayed here because of all the glowing reviews.[SEP]the old town inn was not at all up to my expectations.[SEP]the analog to digital conversion took place weeks prior to my stay, but this hotel still had not made any provisions for this.[SEP]no converter box or cable service.[SEP]basically, no channels at all.[SEP]the television was totally useless.[SEP]when making a reservation, there were no doubles available.[SEP]upon arrival, i asked and was told there was one available, but instead of giving me the rate quoted for this room at the time of booking, i was charged $50 extra per night!!![SEP]the lobby was locked upon check - out.[SEP]staff was nowhere to be found.[SEP]renovations taking place while i was there.[SEP]very noisy day and night.[SEP]very thin walls![SEP]very dirty, seedy location and not good if it's the gas light district you want to see.[SEP]you can do better with just about any other hotel.
0	we got the hotel via hotwire so had a great rate, however this was not a great location for anyone traveling on vacation or just staying a night for a cruise.[SEP]unless you prefer to eat at the hotel restaurants, there literally was nothing in walking distance - you're surrounded by other hotels and the convention center.[SEP]taxis to old san juan and condado, where all the restaurants are, were about $15 one - way.[SEP]the hotel is newer so was clean as expected.[SEP]the staff were very friendly, though the check - in process probably took two or three times longer than normal.[SEP]it's right across the street from the convention center so i'm guessing this is going to be a great spot for business or convention go - ers but avoid the location if you can if you want to walk to restaurants or attractions.[SEP]it was even a $12 ride to the panam cruise pier which was in walking distance (but no side walks to conveniently haul luggage).
0	my daughters and i booked this hotel not knowing anything but the reviews that i have read on trip advisor which were mixed.[SEP]we attended the lady gaga concert.[SEP]we were going to stay at the marriott, but the rates were very high for one nite stay.[SEP]we chose this hotel because of the rates and the location next to the staples center.[SEP]this hotel does not look " chic or fancy " in the lobby or elevator, but the rooms are gorgeous.[SEP]comfortable beds, nice bathroom, all new showers, decor.[SEP]very very nice![SEP]when we left, i noticed the next day that my wedding ring was gone.[SEP]i was sure i left it there as i had taken it off to wear something else to the concert.[SEP]long story short, the manager, john kelly, went over and above any customer service i have ever had in my whole life![SEP]he searched the room inside and out and called me back several times to try to console me and showed so much compassion on what i was going through.[SEP]eventually, i found the ring and called him back to let him know.[SEP]he was so genuine in his concern for everything.[SEP]this kind of customer service is so rare, and even if i hadn't found my ring, i still would have had positive thoughts for this hotel.[SEP]i def will stay again!!!
0	we have just returned from 5 nights in new york.[SEP]the location was great for just about everything.[SEP]the hotel was clean and friendly.[SEP]it was a small room with its own bathroom which is a luxury for the price we paid.[SEP]round the corner was the empire state building and walking distance from broadway, times square and quite a few other places.[SEP]it had a iron and hairdryer which i was surprised by.[SEP]the only down side is it had no tea making facility and was quite noisey at night - but for a city that doesn't sleep we did nt mind.[SEP]it was great for the money it cost and would go back again should i ever get the chance.
0	aurora was fine overnight, but i'm glad i spent the majority of my time in berlin in a more central location.[SEP]it's true that it is close to public transport links and it's also very cheap, however in a city like berlin you don't have to pay too much more for a far more central location with shops, cafes, and life well in to the night and then in the morning for a coffee and breakfast.[SEP]there was not much of this around aurora.[SEP]aside from the location - aurora was clean and quiet, but very dimly lit.[SEP]the door from the street and central corridor remained opened and unlocked to the rooms all night and there was no visible staff member on our floor.[SEP]this was a bit disconcerting when leaving the room to use the separate bathrooms, would have been more so if i'd been travelling alone.[SEP]the room was very simple, clean and an adequate size with a window to the courtyard.
0	this hotel is not for business travelers - this is a very old school hotel room style - the rooms are extremely small (the bathroom even smaller) - the closet doors can't even open all the way - i feel like i'm in a shoebox.[SEP]the restaurant is prominently displayed on the website and even at check - in after a long flight i asked " is room service available " (they said yes) - when i called down to the restaurant to ask for room service, they informed me that there was in fact no room service, but i could come down and get to - go.[SEP]ended up eating dinner out of a cardboard box complete with plastic silverware blech.[SEP]seriously, no room service for a hotel charging these rates per night in a downtown location??[SEP]despite a high price, they also still charge another $10 for wired internet service in the rooms.[SEP]ridiculous.[SEP]small window looks directly into another room.[SEP]might be well placed for leisure travelers, but i definately won't be staying again when travelling to san diego on business.
0	just returned from 4 days/3 nights at the hgv las vegas strip.[SEP]what a mistake.[SEP]should have realized i guess that a condo based hotel wouldn't be ideal in vegas, but now won't forget next time.[SEP]rooms are fine -- even nice.[SEP]kitchenette, 1 bedroom, nice bathroom.[SEP]beds are terrible, particularly the hide - a - bed.[SEP]don't get a one bedroom and expect to sleep someone on the hide - a - bed, not even a child.[SEP]big problem however is the location.[SEP]it is on the " strip " in the same way that alaska is in the united states.[SEP]way down by circus circus and the sahara, with absolutely no amenties anywhere.[SEP]want to eat?[SEP]better plan on walking 15 minutes, getting a cab, or buying groceries and cooking in your room.[SEP]want the quintessential las vegas buffet?[SEP]forget about it -- only restaurant is a lame little deli / store that got our order completely wrong both times we used it.[SEP]casino?[SEP]again, get a cab or walk 15 minutes.[SEP]see the " real " strip -- bellagio, etc?[SEP]15 minute cab ride or the horribly unpredictable and slow " deuce " bus -- another thing to avoid (drops you off across from the hotel on the wrong side of 6 lane las vegas blvd in a construction zone with no crosswalk or light).[SEP]seeing or doing any of the key sights in vegas is a huge hassle from this place.[SEP]stay at a real hotel is our recommendation.
0	stayed here in jan for several days the room was very average -- nothing special.[SEP]a view staring into the windows of a condo complex across the street.[SEP]shades had to be drawn the entire time.[SEP]no bath, just shower.[SEP]nice and large lcd tv.[SEP]water bottles were $4 each - usually you get 2 complimentary at other hotels.[SEP]the business center -- 2 computers working (3 in all) ; very cramped and next to a noisy conference room, difficult to get any work done.[SEP]many people tried to walk in but all computers were taken.[SEP]wifi is available in the room but for an additional 16 - 20 $per day depending on if you want fast or slow wifi.[SEP]found myself wondering if this should really cost extra with such a sub par business center.[SEP]the breakfast - not cheap --- $22 per person for buffet, though it was very tasty.[SEP]there is a continental version for $16 as an alternative or a starbucks which is the cheapest option.[SEP]due to the location, not many breakfast alternatives.[SEP]fitness center: pretty good -- free weights and several machines as well as a lot of aerobic equipment.[SEP]good for a hotel.[SEP]service and staff was excellent.[SEP]very friendly.[SEP]overall i thought this hotel was a b / b- ; i didn't like all the extra fees which don't exist in many other chains, made me feel like a piã±ata, not a guest.[SEP]location could be better as well.
0	the room was small, cramped and dark.[SEP]it only had two small lights which made it difficult to read.[SEP]when i booked the room, i asked for a room with a balcony... they said that they had a room available with a balcony and a view of the cathderal.[SEP]the balcony view was on the backside of the hotel and i barely had a view of the cathderal.[SEP]there was a small hole in the wall by the nightstand.[SEP]the lock on the door was hardly adequate.[SEP]i asked for a different room and they said that they had none available.[SEP]the room was clean.[SEP]not worth 59 euro a night, even though it was in a prime location.[SEP]i would of changed hotels, but it was already paid for, and this was at the end of my trip and i was too tried to make the effort to look for another hotel
0	hands down the worst hotel i have ever stayed at.[SEP]cheap does not mean it can be unclean, run down, musty, noisy, and generally mis - managed.[SEP]the bed and bedding were old, unclean, and musty.[SEP]the floors and walls were filthy, and the whole place smelled.[SEP]the door - jam had clearly been kicked in and was only screwed back into the wall, so the lock wouldn't be able to handle a person leaning against it.[SEP]the bath - tub had so much water underneath it that you couldn't safely stand in / on it (i wish i was kidding).[SEP]the table legs were bent out of shape so the table was basically unusable (not that there is room to use it), and the chair was stained with god - knows - what.[SEP]the place is connected with vents (except in the bathroom!?!) so that you can hear even the lowest conversations as if they were in your room.[SEP]and, we had 4 or 5 staying in the room next to us that were so obnoxious that we ended up leaving (this was after trying to get staff to do something about it![SEP]the breakfast was an insult given that you're in montreal (definitely food city!), and the location isn't in the safest or best part of town (a lot of drunks, street - folks, and rowdies).[SEP]simply put: its a dump.
0	we stayed here in august for 4 nights the feelings of my family are mixed.[SEP]the rooms are nice.[SEP]the location is not.[SEP]the pool is great.[SEP]the food is not.[SEP]some front desk staff speak english and are helpful, some don't speak english and are rude.[SEP]some managers are good, some were not the shuttle to the city is not good.[SEP]taxis were usually available at 15 euros each way the biggest problem at this hotel is the smoke.[SEP]while there are no smoking rooms there is not a no smoking floor.[SEP]we had a heavy smoker in the room next to us which defeated the whole purpose.[SEP]the staff agreed it was a silly policy but said they will not change it so, stay here if you want to swim, don't mind paying for cabs to rome centre for sights and for dinner and if you like second hand smoke.[SEP]these annoyances sadly did not offset the beauty of the location and the breakfast and mixed service
0	we drove from portland to seattle for an afternoon mariners game and had decided to stay one night to' explore' seattle.[SEP]this location was a bit south of everything, but i knew that when i made the reservations.[SEP]i'd read the reviews on this location, so was a bit leery.[SEP]at checkin, the clerk suggested a room in the back which she said was quieter.[SEP]the view was kind of park - like, and there was a picnic table below (next to the garbage enclosed garbage cans).[SEP]the room was within my expectations, very clean and adequate for the price.[SEP]there was a bit of an' old room' smell, but a couple of spritz's of my room spray took that away.[SEP]we did turn the fan on for a bit of' grey' noise overnight (again had to use my room spray).[SEP]my bed was very comfortable, which was nice![SEP]basically if you're expecting the luxury of a $100 + a night motel, do nt stay here..[SEP]but if you just want a cheap place to spend the night and you do stay here, ask for a room in the back.
0	we stayed here two nights.[SEP]while the rooms were updated and clean, the service is horrible.[SEP]they claim to have continental breakfast, however, this is a joke.[SEP]i went down at 6:30am and 8:00am the second morning.[SEP]breakfast was either gone or the breakfast area was so disgusting that you wouldn't want to eat it anyways.[SEP]i guess overall its an ok hotel, but don't plan on eating in the morning.[SEP]the other concern i had was the general location of the hotel.[SEP]seemed to be a bunch of gang / thug activity within a half mile or so of the hotel.[SEP]i didn't feel terribly safe.
0	had been to las vegas last year in nov 09,we got pretty good deal from stay.[SEP]overall it was a nice place to stay after all the fun we had in lv we just use to go room to sleep for few hours.[SEP]view was good, amazing and scary rides.[SEP]when you go on top floor u can see the entire view..[SEP]it was beautiful.the location is not that great because it's far away from everything need to walk alot but bus stop is nearby.[SEP]the rooms are clean.[SEP]no internet and expensive.
0	kerb - side appeal definitely leaves much to be desired, but this hotel is very close to the metro (maria christina), and a number of restaurants nearby.[SEP]check in was fairly quick, room was good.[SEP]clean and well sized.[SEP]however the view was of a wall, and the room was fairly dark.[SEP]pros -internet connectivity was good, bed comfortable, room quiet, bathroom nice, mini - safe, tv, heating / ac all fine.[SEP]location was very good for the offices i needed to attend, but not so great for tourists- but less than 30 mins away by metro to the tourist sights / sites.
0	friendly hotel staff and comfortable, modern rooms were offset by the hotel's location.[SEP]it is in an industrial park on the outskirts of town.[SEP]access to the city centre is good, however.[SEP]about a 10 - 15 minute walk to public transportation and then 15 minute ride.[SEP]hotel is designed in very modern style ; offers great amenities.
0	we stayed at the radisson from august 25 - 28.[SEP]first of all, the hotel itself is nice and the executive suite was very comfortable and nice but the location is terrible (i expected tropical and it's located in the condado area which is very city - ish and dumpy and under a lot of construction and it is not on the beach or even near a nice beach).[SEP]and second of all we had some very minor problems with our room which was not a big deal and when we told the staff they acted like we were lying which i didn't like.[SEP]we ordered room service for dinner one night and i must say the food was excellent.[SEP]breakfast was the all you can eat buffet for $10.95 which was reasonable and good although i've had better, but it was worth the money and we ate a lot and even brought boxed cereal and fruit back to our room for the next morning and nobody said anything.[SEP]all in all, the hotel was nice but the location was not.[SEP]i would recommend staying in isla verde which is the more tropcial strip if staying in san juan.[SEP]i personally would never go back to san juan again because one visit was enough.
0	this hotel, in the middle of hollywood, suffers the most from the deterioring environment that hollywood has become.[SEP]this part of the city has had its best time long ago and is going downwards.[SEP]even if the hotel is close to the walk of fame, you will see that a lot of shops have been closed already years ago, and the shops that are left are “ cheap ”.[SEP]you will not find any restaurant in the close neighborhood of the hotel.[SEP]above that, the restaurant of the hotel itself is noisy and cold, and not a good alternative either.[SEP]the room we received however was ok.[SEP]it was big and clean, and had a small kitchenette with microwave.[SEP]hotel staff was helpfull and friendly.[SEP]in general it is like another traveler mentioned already before: not the hotel loses the stars, it's the location.[SEP]because of the environment, we would however not recommend to stay here.
0	we had a short break at aparthotel acacia.[SEP]despite their insistence on knowing when we would arrive the rooms were not ready when we did arrive despite this being later than the check in time and later then we had estimated.[SEP]one of our party had been taken ill hence our slightly later arrival and despite reception knowng about this distinct lack of interest in getting us our rooms.[SEP]the light in the kitchenette area in one of the rooms didn't work in all the time we are there and on the last night they offered to change our rooms the next day - when we were due to check out![SEP]shame as the rooms were spotless and well equipped.[SEP]arriving on a sunday means that the main supermarket and lots of bars and restuarants in the area were closed - better to get there one day earlier or later.[SEP]also in an area called hospital clinic gives you a clue - ambulances racing through the traffic sirens blaring![SEP]to get to the central tourist areas is a good 15 minutes walk and by metro involves a change.[SEP]nice hotel shame about the location and lack of customer focus.
0	stayed here a few nights in paris.[SEP]denfert - rochereau station is one of the trainstations nearby, but i have to say, it really did nt feel safe / secure.[SEP]be wary of some people who " linger " there and ask you questions... the hotel was nice, very american feel in paris, although it felt very removed from everything.[SEP]neighborhood seemed residential but just ok.[SEP]beds were very comfortable, had nice view of paris.[SEP]gym was pretty good too.[SEP]if this hotel was on st.[SEP]germain, it would have been perfect.[SEP]if you want to get a feel for a quaint french hotel type experience this hotel is nt it for you.[SEP]if i had to do it all over again, i would not stay here, good hotel, bad location.
0	scary location, comfortable hotel... the hotel itself is a bright pink color, which should clue any passerby into the fact that this best western isn't exactly the lap of luxury (the d茅cor is equally as weird and goofy inside).[SEP]overall, it was a comfortable stay.[SEP]our family had one large two - room unit for 3 nights and we found the room to be both clean and comfortable.[SEP]the maids did a good job of bringing our room to tip - top shape each day.[SEP]the employees behind the desk were fine, with the exception of one rude incident.[SEP]parking is done via valet and waiting for your car key can be a rather lengthy experience (even though your car is only several feet away from you).[SEP]obviously you must factor in the parking fee of $15 a day and any tips you might choose to give.[SEP]no breakfast is included with the room fee.[SEP]windows to the rooms seemed to be a quarter of an inch thick and did not feel safe.[SEP]the neighborhood is quite frightening with graffiti and possible prostitutes just on the other side of the hotel (do not walk the area at night).[SEP]the hotel isn't too far from the san fran sights, through it is tough to get back to the hotel thanks to its location among a bunch of one - way streets.[SEP]there was a strange occupation fee of $20 each night (on top of tax) included in our final bill that we still don't understand.[SEP]it was a decent stay with some uncomfortable issues.
0	really dirty and incredibly noisy when our airline oversold our flight to maui they decided to send us to overnight in honolulu and then fly us to maui the following morning.[SEP]the hotel they chose for us was this best western.[SEP]being familiar with the chain this seemed to be a reasonable choice and we were after all just spending the night and then moving on the following day.[SEP]the location of the building is nearly under the freeway overpass and very close to the airport so you are bombarded by noise from both places.[SEP]in our first room the airconditioner was not working and there were fresh blood stains on the bedspread.[SEP]now i'm not at all a fussy traveller but i draw the line at freshly spilled blood on the bed linens.[SEP]i called the front desk and asked if we could be moved to another room and was offered a courtyard suite.[SEP]this room was on the ground level and somewhat less noisy.[SEP]my friend opened the door of the room to let in some air.[SEP]when i stuck my head outside i noticed a couple of very unsavoury characters hanging out in the back alley which bordered the hotel.[SEP]i then locked and bolted the door and went to sleep thinking we had a 50/50 chance of being robbed before morning.[SEP]free shuttle to airport was good and on time, and the full breakfast very good.[SEP]there has to be more than one hotel close to the airport and i would recommend that you stay somewhere else.
0	my husband was attending a conference and i tagged along.[SEP]the hotel was chosen by the event planners.[SEP]the rooms looked like the web site.[SEP]i have to say that it seemed like little thought went into the functionality of the design.[SEP]you enter though the bathroom which is ok but it is all glass.[SEP]remember to close the bathroom blinds.[SEP]the shape of the building is such that people walking down the hall can look right into your room.[SEP]the views are very good but i had to keep the blinds drawn most of the time.[SEP]the shower is great looking though again not well thought out.[SEP]the shower heads face the shower door.[SEP]not thinking i turned the water on and got a direct hit.[SEP]there is no way to let the water warm without getting sprayed.[SEP]plus the shower door is flush with the floor and did not seal correctly.[SEP]each time we showered we flooded the room.[SEP]during our stay it rained heavily.[SEP]most of the hallways had water coming in.[SEP]they had towels down lining the hallways in an attempt to stop the water from coming in.[SEP]i found the staff to be disinterested at best.[SEP]the only good thing i can say is it is a good location for attending a conference but if your traveling for fun i'd stay elsewhere.
0	i booked this using travelocity and paid $65.00 but didn't know which hotel i booked.[SEP]this service works well with priceline and hotwire but not here.[SEP]the hotel has a decent bed and the included breakfast was ok but that is all the good.[SEP]the location is on a busy road across from a thrift store.[SEP]while we parked outside a patron who had parked his car underground complained it had been broken into.[SEP]a sketchy area far from downtown.[SEP]the hallway smelled of nil ordour, the traffic noise started at 6 am and the bathroom was small.[SEP]free slow internet though.[SEP]and good selection of tv channels on the old tv.[SEP]too bad the channel changer was broken.[SEP]a solid two star, which you will find next to any freeway in america.[SEP]good for one night especially if you want to buy a cheap car in one of the many nearby used car lots or a gut bomb at a nearby greasy spoon.
0	this is a " get what you pay for " situation.[SEP]it's not fancy, but it's more than adequate.[SEP]my husband and i had a great time staying there.[SEP]we didn't go to san juan to hang out in the hotel, so it met all of our needs.[SEP]the staff were very friendly and helpful, helping us making rental car / travel reservations, etc.[SEP]the bar was available for a couple drinks before heading out in the evening.[SEP]our main complaint was with the location of our room, it was right next to the front desk and we could hear everything.[SEP]luckily (and unluckily) the air conditioning unit was very loud so it drowned out some of the commotion.[SEP]but, like i said, we were only there to sleep so this didn't bother us too much.[SEP]this doesn't reflect on the hotel at all, but we wished we had stayed in old san juan.[SEP]condado was nice, with great restaurants and it was still close to osj, but it wasn't as much of the vacation experience we were looking for.[SEP]i would definitely consider staying there again, but i would be sure to ask for an upstairs room.
0	i loved this hotel.[SEP]like the pictures on the website, it is very clean and modern, but still charming and colorful.[SEP]the lobby is very nice and hip, and there's cool modern art on the walls, but we didn't spend much time there.[SEP]usually it was pretty deserted.[SEP]the staff was very friendly and helpful.[SEP]our room was very nice - good colors and cozy but maybe a bit cramped ; we had one with two single beds, and they were pushed together and a bit low.[SEP]not much of a view, because our window overlooked a small courtyard, but still it was nice.[SEP]the only downside was the location.[SEP]i had chosen the hotel based on the hotel itself, unaware that bastille is a metro - ride away from most of the places we went to see.[SEP]don't get me wrong, bastille is a very nice and charming district, just not as lively as other parts of paris.[SEP]i probably wouldn't stay here another time for that reason.[SEP]but, for some of you, this might be a plus because at night, it's not too noisy at all outside.[SEP]i'm a type of person who likes to hear sounds of the city.[SEP]best part: atmosphere worst part: location
0	the artemis hotel is perfectly nice inside.[SEP]the staff were relatively friendly (they smiled) and checked us in and out fairly quickly.[SEP]the room was perfectly fine, very comfy bed, excellent toiletries, stocked minibar, air con.[SEP]nice flat screen tv with a selection of music tracks.[SEP]all in all i'd say it's a nice hotel, however, the location is not great if you're wanting to go into the city.[SEP]it's located pretty close to the airport and is a good 20 mins tram ride away.[SEP]it's in a business district with no bars, cafes or amenities surrounding and is a bit isolated with no atmosphere.[SEP]perfect for business guests who want to stay near the airport, but not for tourists wanting a weekend getaway to amsterdam.
0	the hotel is really stylish & modern with a good location next to the metro station at vavin.[SEP]the area around the hotel was really quiet at night so if you're looking for a lively cafe atmosphere i would stay somewhere else.[SEP]the rooms are small with a good bathroom.[SEP]don't stay in the rooms across form the courtyard as there is only one tiny window, we were put here first but requested a move.[SEP]the stairs are steep up to the other rooms and the lift is tiny - just so you're aware.[SEP]we had breakfast in le rotonda just up from the hotel and it was nice - breads, juice, coffee (yum).[SEP]i would suggest spending a little time in the luxemborg gardens at the end of rue vavin and visiting the chocolate shop - also on the street, but apart from these two things you will need to take the metro to everywhere else, which is no problem.[SEP]overall a lovely hotel in a poor - ish location.
0	we were put up in the prenses hotel for a couple of nights when our flight home was cancelled due to snow.[SEP]it's a lovely hotel, with very comfortable, spacious rooms, spotlessly clean.[SEP]it has a lot of facilities which we didn't have time to make use of.[SEP]all the staff were polite, friendly, and couldn't do enough to help.[SEP]breakfast was an enormous array of everything you could image, hot and cold.[SEP](except bacon, of course) as the airline was paying, we had a set evening meal, but that was also very good.[SEP]the one drawback was the location - it's in the middle of an industrial estate on the asian side of istanbul.[SEP]fine if you're looking for a stopover from sabiha gokcen airport, which is about 30 mins away, but about an hour by local bus and a ferry to the european side.
0	as i mentioned, hotel is horrible.[SEP]the main reasons, among others, for that conclusion are: 1.[SEP]really, really, really far away from city centre 2.[SEP]very, very poor breakfast (lets say no breakfast) 3.[SEP]unkind working staff first of all, you should never book this hotel because of his location.[SEP]you will need at least one hour and 25 min to city centre.[SEP]by the way, bus is always full, but always.[SEP]you will have to share the space in bus with a lot of people who are not so polite.[SEP]driving from hotel to city centre and than go back (the last one is around midnight) will ‘ cost’ you 3 hours.[SEP]you will be nervous and unwilling to do the same next day.[SEP]or maybe you like torture?!!![SEP]second thing is breakfast.[SEP]just one sentence is enough regarding this remark.[SEP]no breakfast!![SEP]some bread with artificial jam and juice.[SEP]do you like that????[SEP]third, staffs who works during the night is not polite.[SEP]during the day situation is better.[SEP]all in all, if you do n’t want to spoil your holiday in beautiful city, such as rome, you should never book this hotel!!![SEP]all the best, sasha
0	this is a nice, reasonably priced hotel - it's clean, fairly modern, and has comfortable beds.[SEP]the staff makes this place as they are very friendly and willing to accomodate.[SEP]location is ok, it's near times square but next to the port authority bus station - great for catching cabs as there is a cab line just around the corner, but somewhat sketchy.[SEP]there is a small bar in the lobby and a fitness center.[SEP]i'd stay again.
0	this hotel was good, but my expectations were much higher, so to be honest i was disappointed.[SEP]the bed wasn't that comfortable, the tv took a long time to load and the dressing gowns in the bathroom were as hard as can be - so you didn't want to wear them!!.[SEP]the reception staff weren't that friendly, however the door men were.[SEP]at night, the wind was whistling thru the windows which was so annoying and you could hear noises from other rooms.[SEP]it was a good location, but i would have preferred to be on the other side near michigan avenue.[SEP]i am all for paying good money for a great hotel but in my opinion i think this was a highly overrated hotel and there would be better hotels for less price.
0	my daughter and stayed here for one night before travelling on throughout other parts of turkey.[SEP]the staff was very helpful and warm -- however, when we paid in cash, the exchange rate they gave was much different than the bank / exchange shop rates (and, to their advantage).[SEP]even though we tried to insist on having the present daily rate, they were adamant about the weaker rate, so we lost money on that one.[SEP]the room was very small, but adequate.[SEP]the rooftop garden was lovely, but all rooftops in the older area of sultanehmet show ancient, decaying sights.[SEP]because we were very near a mosque, we were blasted out by the call to prayer at 5:00 am and in the evening.[SEP]the location is convenient to many well - known sights, but is busy with traffic.[SEP]we would stay in another place if we were to return.
0	i was disappointed to find that the customer service here was awful.[SEP]i was told a different price on the phone than when i arrived.[SEP]i never received a confirmation email and when i was talking to the front desk attendant about this he was incredibly rude and smug.[SEP]the room was alright but smelled and was in a location by the pool and the lobby so there was a lot of noise.[SEP]the location seemed a little sketchy and was pretty far from smathers and duval.[SEP]they do have a shuttle running to both places but the one to the beach runs only every hour and the one to duval stops at 12.[SEP]i wouldn't stay here again.
0	this hotel seems to be not very popular to taxi drivers.[SEP]everytime we want to get to the hotel, we have to show the hotel map to the drivers, but they are still not sure of the location of this hotel.[SEP]nothing is near from the hotel, only what i found was seven - eleven right next to the hotel.[SEP]rooms are small not a good view, very close to the next building.[SEP]staffs are not very helpful, i asked them how to get to a restaurant, but they were chatting themselves but not cared enough.[SEP]elevator is very old too.[SEP]breakfast was not so good, not various collections(as i remember, just some breads & jams..[SEP]etc) not very recommendable
0	wasn't expecting much because we hadn't paid much but, staff can't be bothered to do there jobs to the point of being rude.[SEP]i went to florida a few years ago and loved the friendliness of everyone, non of that here![SEP]they seem totally inconvienced at having to be there.[SEP]rooms ok but not that clean.[SEP]location is ok but there are better locations for the same price.[SEP]they have a hotel that sells timeshares, we went on the promise of free tickets to a dinner show, which we got but when we said we didn't want to actually buy a timeshare they turned quite unpleasant.[SEP]the bar only opened if they had staff!
0	a new hotel, well appointed, with no frills but yet comfortable and clean.[SEP]free internet and also breakfast were great value adds.[SEP]what you see is what you get – and i guess that when you ’re using the hotel to sleep only, that ’s not a bad thing.[SEP]the location is n’t that fabulous, but it wo nt stop you from sightseeing if that ’s what you ’re there to do.[SEP]would definitely stay there again.
0	this hotel caters to convention goers / business people.[SEP]it is not kid friendly.[SEP]they charge for everything.[SEP]there's no microwave or refrigerator in the room unless you pay for it.[SEP]the parking is $15 per day, and this is not a safe location, so you can not really park anywhere else.[SEP]the parking lot attendant was quite pleasant.[SEP]the closet space was minimal.[SEP]the windows were dirty.[SEP]the tub was actually dirty as well, and had long black hair in it.[SEP]we waited at least 45 minutes for two hamburgers in the hotel restaurant.[SEP]the restaurant service was below average in general.[SEP]the pool is right next to the bar, on display, and there zero shade.[SEP]it's also tiny.[SEP]the hotel is not in a safe location.[SEP]during the short time that we left the hotel and drove a few blocks away, there was a shooting, police, and helicopters.[SEP]around the corner there was a protest and a block was shut off to cars.[SEP]it took about 30 minutes to drive around a 4 block radius.[SEP]i would not return to this hotel.
0	i went to hotel aristotle in september from choosing it from the internet.[SEP]the hotel is located behind termini station.[SEP]the hotel is in a building with 2 floors.[SEP]the room was clean, but i felt it was a bit pricy for the type of hotel.[SEP]it included breakfast, but you have to eat the same thing everyday and it became very boring.[SEP]if you return to the hotel very late at night, you have to use a key to get in from the front entrance.[SEP]then once on your floor you have to use another key to get into another area.[SEP]my room was located on the 4th floor so if you like to sleep beyond 7:30am, this hotel is not for you.[SEP]you should be up by 7:30am because it gets very nosey.[SEP]the location is ok.[SEP]i am not a big fan of termini station because of all the people hanging out late at night and i did not feel safe.[SEP]liked: clean room did not like: the key system, i felt like i was in prison.[SEP]a bit too pricy for the quality.[SEP]no phone in the room.[SEP]i would not return to this hotel.
0	i stayed at hilton grand vacations club as part of a timeshare presentation.[SEP]the cost for 3 nights was great, about $170 or so if i recall correctly.[SEP]check - in was no problem and i was shown my room very quickly.[SEP]the rooms themselves are a nice size and are attractively furnished.[SEP]the location is not good at all, bounded by the unfinished echelon project, circus circus, and sahara.[SEP]the pool is nice for a timeshare and there is a food shop on the lower level in case you want to eat in.[SEP]my opinion was probably biased by a very high pressure sales presentation that i could have done without.[SEP]in all, you can get a better location for the same money in a better location.
0	the location is' central' but the neighborhood is ugly, period.[SEP]it's a dump really.[SEP]rooms are small.[SEP]extremely noisy.[SEP]last call at the club is 2.45 am so don't expect to sleep earlier than that.[SEP]there is no housekeeping as such, just one person working as a bell man, room service, house keeping so do nt expect to have anything done in timely manner.[SEP]bring your own shower cap, slippers etc because you need to ask for them.[SEP]i asked for a blanket but it looks so dirty.[SEP]i usually stay at the best hotels in the world so perhaps my standard is high.[SEP]this is probably one of the worst hotel i have stayed at.[SEP]saff is nice but that was it.[SEP]horrible!
0	location: on the far e side of mission bay, right of the highway, in the middle of a very popular area of the park.[SEP]lots of people walking in close proximity to the villas..[SEP]the pool area is gated, but the villas are not.[SEP]the are homeless people camping around.[SEP]this was the first time i did not feel safe staying at a hotel.[SEP]one night, while on the patio, we could clearly see someone hiding in the bushes.[SEP]the villas are remodeled, beds are comfortable, rooms are spacious with refrigerator and coffee station with lavazza coffee.[SEP]there was a damp smell that we could not get rid of ; it must have been there for a long time.:-) the grounds are beautiful, unfortunately, we did not get to take advantage of all the seasonal activities - mostly available during the summer season.[SEP]i would return if not for the safety issues.[SEP]if you decide to go, try and get a centrally located villa, maybe closer to the pool area and not on the property edge.[SEP]also, be prepared to pay an outrageous parking fee for self parking... i believe it was over $20/ night.
0	the service at the bars, both downstairs and the xyz, is the worst i have experienced in my several years of functional alcoholism.[SEP]the weekend i stayed was probably one of the busiest weekends in san francisco during the year, with both usc and ucla in the area playing football games against stanford and cal, respectively.[SEP]the management had the brilliant idea to staff only two bartenders at each location to serve the 300 - 400 people that came out for the bar scene on saturday night.[SEP]one of my friends (a very attractive girl who one would expect might get immediate attention from a bartender) asked how much longer it would take to get a drink after she had already been waiting for twenty minutes.[SEP]his exact words, " well now you have to wait longer for mouthing off you [ -- ].[SEP]" unfortunately she did not have her pepper spray with her to give him the propert retort.[SEP]our complaints to the manager fell on deaf ears as we saw the manager having a good chuckle with the offending bartender after we complained.[SEP]my suggestion, if you're going to go: stiff everybody on the tips and steal some of the glassware to make up for the exorbitant prices and reprehensible service.[SEP]other than that the rooms were pretty small but well appointed with a modern touch and the location was a little too far south of market.
0	me and my wife stayed there 4 nights 2 weeks ago.[SEP]the hotel is clean and nice, big and comfortable rooms, and even the viwe is nice.[SEP]but!!![SEP]hotel receptionist's are the worst!![SEP]and not just one of theme but the whole crue is very very bad!![SEP]they did nt know where are the bus stations, they make a face everytime you ask theme something until the piont you stop asking, and if they already give you an answer it usualy not correct.[SEP]for a hotel that is not in a good location, its not worth the staying.
0	price was good for the weekend but the location and the hotel itself are depressing.[SEP]decent room, clean but dated - no flat screen tv.[SEP]shower / bath didn't drain.[SEP]and why does marriott provide free internet at courtyards but not at higher end properties.[SEP]didn't want to spend $14.95 just to check traffic conditions.[SEP]hotel is non smoking but smoker hang out right at the entrance, where the ashtrays are and pollute the air as you enter and exit.[SEP]if an area needs to be provided for smokers, can't it be away from the entrance?
0	it was our first trip to london and paris so i was eager to find a good hotel.[SEP]it didn't have to be the best since we were a little tight on budget and since i figured we'll be spending most of the time outside anyway.[SEP]i did my research and found that the reviews for this hotel was overall good.[SEP]and so i booked it.[SEP]when we got there it seemed that it has been updated since the interior looks alot better than the current photos online.[SEP]but as we roamed the city by foot and subway(we stayed in paris for 6 days), i realized how inconvinient the hotel location was.[SEP]we saw better hotel locations close to main attractions and market places for almost the same price.[SEP]if i would have known this i would have paid a little bit more for another hotel w/ a better location.[SEP]also, i knew the rooms were going to be tiny but it was so small that we couldn't even unpack our 2 big luggages since there was no room in the closet.[SEP]and so we had to lay them on the floor and it took up most of the space in the room.[SEP]overall, this hotel was okay since it was fairly clean but if you're visiting paris for the first time i would suggest staying close to the main attractions and/or market places as you will save money for making your own food (we made our own baguettes & paninis) and you'll save time.
0	we jumped in a taxi gave the name and address and the taxi driver had no idea!!!!!!!![SEP]we drove round and round and round for ages and eventually stumbled across it![SEP]this was our 3rd novotel in our oz trip and wasn't the best![SEP]rooms dull and bland and no safe which was disappointing.[SEP]the breakfast was small and we felt rushed, also some queries as to whether we had breakfast included which we did but it again seemed a hassle.[SEP]the location........ if you can, stay down at circular quay or the rocks and be in the heart of sydney.[SEP]we only stayed for one night thankfully before moving down to the quay west suites.[SEP]our advice is you only get what you pay for in sydney and this hotel is proof of that.
0	i stayed there for one night with my kids for a family reunion, so we didn't spend much time in the room or in the hotel.[SEP]i was first attracted there by the great rate for the location, but i discovered that they charged for parking which is very unusual in this area.[SEP]so take this into account when comparing prices with other hotels in the area.[SEP]the bed were very comfortable and we had a very nice night of sleep.[SEP]the room was tiny and we had barely enough space to move in the room.[SEP]there was no room to place opened suitcases.[SEP]the bathroom was also very small with no counter at all.[SEP]it was not so clean: i found many hairs on the floor and on the sink, which were not ours.... i found this a bit discusting.... felt like staying at someone else's place.... i have stayed in many others " quality inn " properties and this hotel doesn't fit in.[SEP]so don't be fooled by the name.[SEP]it is more like an an " econo lodge " at best.[SEP]i don't see why they have 4 stars either.[SEP]maybe because they have a restaurant...?[SEP]you should consider this like an average 3 stars.
0	the rooms are large and i have always had a clean room (i have stayed in this property dozens of nights during the past 5 years).[SEP]the only disturbance is the airconditioning / heater that makes huge noice.[SEP]the location is not good for sightseeing, but it is very good for my business needs.[SEP]the best part of the hotel is the sports bar with good local beers and juicy hamburgers.[SEP]i agree with another reviewer that it is strange to charge for parking in that location.
0	we are in the design industry and we know a value based stay verses cheap hotel overcharging because location and cheap design.[SEP]we new it was bad just when we pulled in to see $30 per night to park... we asked the valet what were the other options and he just smiled and said there are no other options.[SEP]he was lying... parking is just around the corner if you can find it or a $4 lot behind the building.[SEP]with the valet it was a $300 + per night stay.[SEP]we were here for a conference and most of our peers felt this place was probably worth may be a $125 - 150 stay.[SEP]i understand this is downtown san diego but this isn't new york or los angeles.[SEP]we felt this hotel was trying to make a buck where ever we went with their $5 in room toothbrushes to $120 zebra print robes in the closet.[SEP]should you feel super frisky there was a cheetah print silk pajamas tank top or boxer for $30 each.[SEP]this place is lame with their cheap excuse for complementary wine @ 6 pm and poor design.[SEP]we also didn't like the 10th floor (just getting our of the elevator) smelling like a fart either.
0	as my title say, my room was large, comfortable and modern.[SEP]very good indeed.[SEP]i did not call upon the staff for anything except check in and check out so i can not comment on them.[SEP]however, from my limited experience, they seemed efficient and helpful.[SEP]my only gripe about signature is its location.[SEP]my tower was the third one and, therefore, a very significant distance from the mgm grand hotel and the strip.[SEP]this is, initially, fine but very quickly becomes annoying.[SEP]it does make going out and about and enjoying the mgm a bit of a chore.[SEP]by the way, the mgm grand wet and wild pool party is absolutely fantastic - make sure you go along.[SEP]my overall experience was very good.
0	me and my partner went to rome for the first time for a valentines break, and was recommended this by avios as it was the same price as a 3 star hotel.[SEP]the room: very clean, warm considering it had snowed, but no english tv channels so glad of the laptop (to be expected in italy), had a shower, everything was as expected.[SEP]the staff: all very friendly, very willing to help, even gave me a phone charger as there was no travel adapter for mine.[SEP]the food: the breakfast consisted of croosoints, toast, cereal, yoghurts, fruit, and various spreads, this was the only thing i found, there could have been more variety, still, filled a hole.[SEP]location: there was a 10/15 minute walk to the bus stop, once there it was 1 euro per person, but me and my fiancee did struggle... note --- unless you know some italian we didn't really know how the bus worked, there is a ticket machine on the bus which you place a euro in to print a ticket, on the ticket was a time, but nothing to say if it was a return or anything.[SEP]back to the hotel though, overall we were happy with the hotel, and would stay again, couldn't really complain at all.
0	please if you value your life, do not stay here..[SEP]go elsewhere, save the extra money whatever, it's dangerous..[SEP]and should come with a warning!!![SEP]very scary location.[SEP]we were up all night watching drug busts etc.... can't go to eat anywhere because it's so unsafe.[SEP]we had to call the front desk 3 times to make certain the front door was closed..[SEP]we put furniture in front of our door and stayed up all night... no we are not paranoid pussys!!![SEP]it's just plain " horrible " some of the staff was nice, bit of a language barrier..[SEP]if they supplied me with mace, and a gun, i still wouldn't stay.[SEP]we had a meeting at the consulate downtown the next morning.we were so tired from the nights events it made it very hard to concentrate..[SEP]would love my money and nerves back!!![SEP]hey, if you want to experience the pounding sound of police helicopters, sirens, drunks screaming, go for it but again, bring the pepper spray and weapons...
0	the hotel and restaurant staff were very friendly and helpful.[SEP]my stay was great.[SEP]the rooms were clean and a lot better than many hotels in europe.[SEP]the location is accessible by train and nearby rome's airports.[SEP]the hotel does offer shuttle service but has limited pick - up times and only seats the first 35 people.[SEP]for a hotel that size, it is in desperate need of shuttles and more pick - up times.[SEP]also, don't bother with the travel agency in the hotel because the staff was rude.
0	i must say i was disappointed in the property after reading the rave reviews here.[SEP]if you're a business traveler this place is adequate but it's not a location for vacationers yearning for a coastal getaway.[SEP]the inn is in an industrial area with views of the freeway overpass.[SEP]old town is at least a ten minute walk and you must cross the highway which is not pedestrian friendly.[SEP]note - don't be out and about on foot after dark as there are transients in the area.[SEP]the room was clean, located in the older part of the complex.[SEP]there was no micro or frig (they do offer those but none were available).[SEP]unfortunately the sound on the tv would come and go and the dvd player had' connection issues' (the staff did come out twice and tried to fix the problems).[SEP]the morning breakfast was good, the exterior of the building is lovely and overall the staff was accomodating.[SEP]price - wise it was competitive with other motels in this category.[SEP]since there's so much to do in san diego you really don't spend alot of time in your room so i guess this place works for budget - minded travelers without kids who don't mind being across the street from a sprawling industrial complex, train depot and highway.
0	my husband and two friends utilized the microtel for the third time in four years as a park and fly stay and found the motel extremely lacking in all categories.[SEP]this is not the same motel we have stayed in previously.[SEP]something has changed it over the last two years.[SEP]it is sloven in appearance ; the rooms are minimally clean.[SEP]there were minor, but unnecessary, problems checking in.[SEP]the breakfast is less than hearty.[SEP]the only nearby restaurant in the location (which is semi - industrial) now has a security guard stationed at the door.[SEP]not good but worth putting up with for one night, prior to flying out of philadelphia.[SEP]the main problems was that our vehicle was broken into while we were on our travels.[SEP]we were contacted on our ship to be told our companions cell phones had been found by the new jersey police in a parking lot there, along with some small bags.[SEP]when contacted, the microtel could not say whether the vehicle was stolen or if it remained on the lot.[SEP]upon our return around 1 am, it became apparent that the ignition was missing and we waited for 2 hours for a family member and a ride back to maryland.[SEP]i will not describe what we observed during that time.[SEP]but it confirmed our desire to avoid this motel at all cost in the future.
0	this hotel is a definite 3 star.[SEP]it is no where near a 4 or 5 star hotel.[SEP]it's best quality is that it is clean.[SEP]it is an aging dowager that badly needs an update.[SEP]the furnishings are horrific.[SEP]the desk chair in my room actually collapsed when i sat it in it.[SEP]the room is badly dated and the furnishings are well worn.[SEP]don't stay here if you expect a modern, well appointed hotel.[SEP]however, the staff is friendly and if you don't mind the downtrodden location, you may like the old hotel.
0	basic room in good location if you like upscale shopping (condado).[SEP]getting car in and out of narrow streets surrounding hotel is not for the faint - hearted.[SEP]also, your car is parked in a line of other cars alongside the hotel.[SEP]to get it out, hotel clerk must move whatever cars are behind yours into the narrow street.[SEP]no quick get - aways here, unless you happen to be the last car in the line.
0	as with all hotels its best to do some research before you book.[SEP]this hotel is based in the middle of chinatown.[SEP]this is a bonus if you are chinese but can prove difficult if you are not, i had trouble finding a foreign currency exchange in the immediate area and most people in the local shops stuggle with understand and speaking english.[SEP]the hotel is fairly clean no complaints there.[SEP]but the rooms were small and narrow.[SEP]we had two rooms booked and neither had a safe to lock our passports / monmey away in.[SEP]the hotel does offer a safe service but it is one big safe which is kept elsewhere in the building and everybody to opts into using it has access to it.[SEP]the room also had minimal storage space for clothes.[SEP]the biggest problem was the location of the manhatton bridge, from our bedroom window it must have been no more than 10meters away, this bridge services trains and a highway so the noise is constant.[SEP]the break out areas and reception are fairly dull and boring too.[SEP]for the price i would imagine there are several better hotels for your money.
0	the price was inexpensive but the neighbourhood leaves a lot to be desired.[SEP]i would look for another location in a nicer part of town.[SEP]very close to airport but yet didn't hear the airplanes.[SEP]i did hear the neighbours across the parking lot screaming at each other though![SEP]a sketchy neighbourhood![SEP]the a / c unit had 1 speed (high) so we had to shut it off due to too noisy.[SEP]the rooms were clean.
0	i paid $300 a night for this place?[SEP]give me a break![SEP]this property is not close to what i would have expected for a rate such as this.[SEP]even at $150 a night, you can do better elsewhere.[SEP]pros: clean rooms nice landscaping polite front desk staff kitchens in the room (if that is something that you want) good food at the clubhouse apartment style layout for privacy big deck off the room good golf course washer & dryer in the room dvd rentals in the loby cons: way overpriced for what you get no two bed configurations (only 1 bed with a sleeper sofa) annoying timeshare salespeople no valet no room service no bellman cheap mattress, linens and towels maids did not come to clean my room until after 3:30pm not enough parking close to your room location of the property 1980 ’s cabinetry in the kitchen no pay - per view
0	nice new hotel with all the modern touches, incl bedside touchpad that runs everything in the room.[SEP]we got a very good deal from the hotel thru e - mail that incl $250 resort credit, so can not complain at all.[SEP]we were upgraded to a city view room but they hadn't cleaned the windows in some time, so any view would not have made a difference.[SEP]highly recommend the cafe vettro for good food and great service.[SEP]found the biggest problem with this resort is the location.[SEP]you can not easily get to anywhere without a long jog thru the large crystals shopping centre.[SEP]we did find a shorter route by walking over to monte carlo and across the road to access transportation.[SEP]this complex is kind of " on the wrong side of the street " and set pretty far back for easy access to anything.[SEP]definately worth a try is you visit lv a lot, but not if it's your first time.
0	hated the hilton times square location good for broadway and macys but would not recommend to people who dislike noise or crowds.[SEP]times square was very claustrophobic.[SEP]we had deluxe room which was extra large and a nice view from the 33 rd floor and well soundproofed.[SEP]room very clean.[SEP]all the staff were helpful especially the bell boys.[SEP]the air conditioning in the public lobby which served as a reception, a bar and a restaurant was inadequate and the area was often stuffy and suffered from food smells coming from the restaurant area.[SEP]the drinks were unispiring and expensive and not a patch on the exotic cocktails available at half the price in a restaurant over the road.[SEP]dinner menu was expensive for what it was and the braised vegetable that came with our steak was bitter and inedible.[SEP]i would not stay in the times square area again and in fact preferred the radisson on lexington avenue
0	this hotel was nice however out of the city which meant that you had to get a bus or tram into the centre, this however was not to much of a major problem in the day time as they run very frequently, however in the night is was a very diffrent story.[SEP]if you are going to amsterdam for the city shopping, nightlife or smoking this is not the hotel for you as the travel is just to much to do daily.[SEP]the hotel itself was ok not of a 4 * standard we stayed in a " deluxe city view room " which consisted of a side view of the very end of the canal?[SEP](not acceptable to pass the room category off as a city view whatsoever in my personal opion), the room was extremely basic and the beds (single) were very small, just enough space for you to sleep on your side![SEP]i have to say if this was a deluxe room that i honestly dreed to think what their basic room type looks like?[SEP]the breakfast was average in terms of what was on offer, hot & cold options, the hotel had very helpful staff which did make the stay enjoyable, if it was in a better location then i would definatly stay back there for the stay was comfortable but i would rate it a 3 * rather than a 4 * hotel.[SEP]it's worth it if you get a cheap deal on easytobook.com.
0	the customer service is 5 stars at this comfortable kimpton property.[SEP]there is a free wine reception in the lobby, very helpful staff, free coffee and tea in the mornings, and if you are an in - touch member free wi - fi.[SEP]the rooms themselves are very well decorated and very comfortable.[SEP]the location however... not good.[SEP]the property sits on the cusp of the really bad part of san francisco (the tenderloin), and feels unsafe as soon as dusk hits.[SEP]it is close enough to the really nice area, just make sure if you're alone you take a cab at night to and from.[SEP]i did walk every morning at 9am to my san francisco office on california street & montgomery, and it was a nice, easy walk with a lot of other business people lining the streets.[SEP]this is a really nice hotel so yes, i would come back, but i'd just stay very alert when going out at night.
0	if you don't mind staying at a low end hotel for the money you could still probably find a better deal somewhere else.[SEP]the rooms (or most to my knowledge) are privately owned.[SEP]in most cases this is common in maui.[SEP]the problem is that each owner designs their condo to their own taste.[SEP]in our case this meant everying including kitchen and bathroom fixtures.[SEP]this is evident when you walk around the resort at night and can see inside some of the condos' from the outside ; and there lies the reason why some reviews are favorable and some are not.[SEP]some rooms are good and in our case horrible.[SEP]the outside of the resort, outdated.[SEP]problems with our room- kitchen that was hip in the 80's, bathroom that jack tripper would have loved, clogged tub, dirty tile floor, broken fixtures, scary smoke detector, insects (not the cute kind), dirty stains on carpet (which showed up in photos), television with bad reception, far north kaanapali location (although they do have a bus that will take you to the main kaanapali hotels so you can catch thier bus to lahina).[SEP]get the picture, we only stayed one night.[SEP]this is not what you pay for when you travel to hawaii.[SEP]on the plus side the beach is beautiful.
0	we booked on priceline and i was quite shocked that they considered this hotel a 4-star.[SEP]it just is not what we are used to!![SEP]the good - 1.[SEP]nice crisp bed linens 2.[SEP]nice views of the water from some rooms, and the lobby and restaurant 3.[SEP]the hotel shop had some nice things for sale the bad - 1.[SEP]the decor is too kitschy for words.[SEP]birchbark print wallpaper.[SEP]bears on lampshades.[SEP]every stick of furniture made from raw logs or antlers.[SEP]2.[SEP]weird musty smell 3.[SEP]valet parking is a total ripoff and unneccessary 4.[SEP]charging for wireless internet 5.[SEP]very pricey restaurant 6.[SEP]lasting impression of the manager at the front desk was of bra straps and weird panty lines - not professional - looking![SEP]7.[SEP]rough stone tile floor in bathroom - no way it could be kept clean - a haven for yucky stuff like maybe plantar wart viruses![SEP]7.[SEP]way too expensive for what it is - a motor hotel trying to pretend it's a first - rate hotel might be a problem for some... tiny rooms shower only in some rooms train noise might be bothersome location amongst the tourist trap area, quite a walk to downtown shops
0	this was one of the worst hotels i've stayed in in the usa.[SEP]the room we got given was small and dirty.[SEP]right outside our window was the multi - story parking lot.[SEP]the bathroom was tiny, filthy, whenever anybody in neighbouring rooms used their shower or sink all their waste water would come up the bath plug and fill our bath with dirty water.[SEP]there were constant loud noises all around our room all night![SEP]got one of the worst nights sleep the 1 night i stayed here.[SEP]the location... it is far off the main bit of the strip, you walk through an area which i didn't feel safe walking down in the day let alone at night.[SEP]never again is all i can say.
0	my friend and i came here on thursday march 15th.[SEP]we were coming for st patricks parade.[SEP]we were on a budget so a high class hotel was out of the question.[SEP]we found hotel " elegant " online.[SEP]so we looked at the pictures online and thought it would be a decent place.[SEP]we knew we would nt get something gorgeous but at least something sleepable... anyways to make a long story short, we arrived the woman at the front desk was not plesent there was this old man always walking around looking and inspecting everything all the time..[SEP]the place smelt like old wet carpets.[SEP]the beds were hard like a rock, the room was extremely hot even with the window open.[SEP]the servide was terrible down stairs.[SEP]the vending machine was empty and not refilled through the whole 4 days we stayed here..[SEP]there was very loud people next door to the point where they bang on the wall cuz they were wrestling and my head actually bounced off the wall.[SEP]i think they let anyone in the building..[SEP]and the location where the hotel is, its very scarey..[SEP]it look like a dump from outside..[SEP]the pictures online that they have do nt even match what the have in the rooms.[SEP]the only thing that is actuallyi n the room that you see online is the blanket..[SEP]and that feels like plastic..
0	we were there for 5 days in december.[SEP]2 days without heater and 1 day without water, is actually worst than a back packers joint.[SEP]location is near union square and chinatown but the slope to reach the hotel will tired you out, especially if you are carrying shopping bags.[SEP]some of the service staffs are really nice but does not make you feel comfortable at all.[SEP]one word, terrible.
0	my husband was working in the area and we decided to make new orleans our vacation spot.[SEP]this way our family could be together even if dad had to work.[SEP]my husband's location was changed 5 days before we were to arrive..[SEP]we called and cancelled immediately.[SEP]the hilton not only charged us the entire $2,000 for the five day reservation, they also told us at time of cancellation we would get our money back.[SEP]almost 3 months later my family is told we are not getting any money back and basically the hiltin has finished discussing the matter with us.[SEP]we are devastated emotionally and financially.[SEP]don't book with them if you think you ever need to cancel!!!
0	i stayed at the town and country in august 2007 for a conference.[SEP]overall, this felt like a well - worn, 1970s hotel that is badly in need of some updating.[SEP]the only thing i enjoyed about this hotel was the pool.[SEP]if you stay here, you should absolutely stay in the royal palm tower, many of the garden rooms looked quite dark.[SEP]ask for a room with a view of the pool.[SEP]my first room was in the tower, but the balcony had a view of a brick wall, and it was dark![SEP](see picture) i asked to be changed to a room with a pool view on the 6th floor.[SEP]it was better.[SEP]good things: lots of pools, easy to find a seat, close to a big mall and the trolley.[SEP]wireless internet is available for $10/day.[SEP]you can extend checkout until 6 pm for half of your daily room rate.[SEP]bad things: weird location (right on a big highway), no real view (i had a view of the pool and the highway), dark rooms, room decor is very old - school english which doesn't fit with a san diego resort, there are some outdated resort features (empty hair salon?).
0	read a lot of negative comments abt this hotel but got no choice as sia's stopover package gave us only two choices, peninsula excelsior or furama city centre which was full when we tried to booked.[SEP]we stayed two nights in the peninsula tower.[SEP]room is small (slightly bigger than the rooms in the business hotels in japan).[SEP]carpet lookd horrible.[SEP]the double bed is very small.[SEP]the bath room is not that clean.[SEP]no hand towels or face towels.[SEP]found a list of items with prices with statment saying that any items missing or damaged would be charged to customer's account.[SEP]so we checked everything in the room and dound many items missing.[SEP]went to the receptionist and were told standard rooms do nt carry all the items.[SEP]what about the hand towels and face towels?[SEP]" oh, they should be there " was the reply.[SEP]finally had the hand towels and face towels delivered to our room.[SEP]however, they disappeared the next day even though two of them were never used location is reasonable but quite a walk to the subway station with so many complaints about the peninsular excelsior, do nt understand why sia still offer them to customers.[SEP]it is definitely doing harm to the reputation of sia
0	i stayed here for 3 nights in september for business.[SEP]the hotel feels safe and is in a decent location.[SEP]it is close to shopping and restaurants but a taxi is necessary.[SEP]the room was big and modern.[SEP]i think the bed was a little hard, but there is a large flat screen tv and the bathroom was very nice.[SEP]the restaurant downstairs is decent.[SEP]the menu is not big and the service is a little slow, but the food is fine.[SEP]my biggest complaint about this hotel is the wireless internet service.[SEP]it is horrible![SEP]all three days at the hotel- the service was spotty at best.[SEP]i called the front desk and i believe they know they have problems with the wireless internet.[SEP](internet with an ethernet cable is not available).[SEP]the front desk was very rude about the problem as it seemed as though they are also frustrated by it.
0	ok, so my 1st problem was the fact that they had wireless internet, but only in the' lobby' which was outside, not indoors, so ofcourse you feel unsafe hanging out in an outside lobby late night just to be on your laptop.[SEP]2nd off, its very loud downtown.we were awaken with all the noise at 9 am after only 3 - 4 hrs of sleep.[SEP]the pool is tiny.the free breakfast is across the street.[SEP]3rd thing was the 1 washer and dryer they had, wasnt working, so no way to wash clothes.[SEP]the staff was very nice and polite.[SEP]it definately was nt worth $110 a night, the location was very bad, and rugged area.[SEP]we had to' find' places to eat.
0	overall this hotel was very nice.[SEP]the only drawback to this place is its location.[SEP]locate well south of the strip getting to and from the strip was a pain.[SEP]i would highly recommend getting a rental car if you are staying here.[SEP]the hotel has everything you need from a casino.[SEP]it has about 6 reasturants, a 64 lane bowling alley, a 4 screen movie theater.[SEP]other live show entertainment is limited.[SEP]the rooms were very spacious, had a nice flat screen tv and plenty of room.[SEP]they do have some great food deals.[SEP]the.75 cent hot dogs at the sports book were good.[SEP]they have a great special at midnight you can get your choice of 3 grave yard specials.[SEP]full on breakfast for $1.25 or $2.25 for steak and eggs.[SEP]they do have a free shuttle from the hotel to madalay bay but we found it very inconvienient.[SEP]other than the location this hotel was great.
0	my wife and i stayed for three nights with two grand daughters aged 8 and 6.[SEP]we used the garden suite which was ideal with young children the hotel is in an excellent location with all major sites within walking distance even for a 6year old.[SEP]the metro is very close.[SEP]also the villa borgese is near which the children enjoyed particularily the rickshaws.[SEP]children can have to much of monuements.[SEP]the accomodation is fine and the staff are very friendly and helpful.[SEP]for us it was a very good choice
0	the rates are way overpriced.[SEP]equivalent to new york 4 star hotels.[SEP]the cable has maybe 20 channels, rooms are old and small.[SEP]location is just the southern end of chinatown.[SEP]it is close to the subways, so you can go visit places you would rather stay.[SEP]the in - room air conditioners sound like your sleeping in a wind tunnel.[SEP]wireless internet is spotty at best.[SEP]could get work done at night in the room.
0	stayed mar 20 - 23, 2011 on a vacation package deal.[SEP]was very dissapointed in room and location.[SEP]i got a room in the ipanema tower, 11th floor.[SEP]very old room, frayed carpet, old tv, no coffee pot (only for vip rooms).[SEP]food options were average food but very expensive, i.e seafood buffet $42 pp breakfast buffet $15 pp.[SEP]hotel located way away from any other resturant options.[SEP]internet was extra $14/day, local calls $1.25....... $15 minimun was the lowest blackjack table i saw.[SEP]carl s.
0	nice size rooms and very helpful staff at the front desk and at breakfast.[SEP]good standards of housekeeping.[SEP]the location is fairly convenient but not picturesque.[SEP]a bit of a haul up the steps with heavy cases and no elevators.[SEP]no complaints but nothing outstanding either,
0	i stayed here on a business trip and was happy with the accomodation.[SEP]the room was comfortable and the breakfast buffet was plentiful.[SEP]the only issue i ran into was the location - it is on the side of a hill off a frontage road.[SEP]parking could be a problem late at night.[SEP]one night i could not get in the side access door because the door key would not work, and i had get in the main door.[SEP]fortunately, there is security access gate for the parking lot that makes it relatively safe.
0	lovely hotel in a good location, but be warned that, unless you use the hotel's free courtesy bus to and from town (about every 1.5 hours), you will pay an additional 10 - 15 euros per taxi ride (30 euros return)!... they say it's within walking distance of the vatican, but it will take you about 45 mins to walk there (and some of the route doesn't have a pavement).[SEP]clean, spacious rooms and friendly, helpful staff.[SEP]also, if you fly into ciampino airport (where most no frills flights fly into) it's between 50 -60 euros in a taxi to the hotel (the hotel do offer a courtesy bus to the airport, but not this one!).[SEP]we pre - booked our taxi online and they charged us 45 euros.[SEP]all in all a reasonably priced, nice hotel - no better or worse than you would expect from a large chain.[SEP]there's a nice restaurant next door - can't remember the name, but as you come out of the hotel entrance take a right and it's right there!
0	this was last hotel on our tour.[SEP]it looks like a motel 6.[SEP]its location is to far from the main sights of rome.[SEP]there is no eating areas so we we ate at the hotel.[SEP]it has a varied menu but we did not care for the food.[SEP]the staff was not that friendly.[SEP]the area around hotel is not the cleanest and the road noise was bothersome.
0	the rooms and the hotel in general were very clean.[SEP]the tower was amazing -- easily the best view of the strip.[SEP]the location has its pluses and minuses.[SEP]it is definitely too far to walk to the main strip, but if you rent a car and you plan on getting out and about quite a bit, the location is great due to easy highway access and no strip congestion.[SEP]the people... eh... not so good.[SEP]they were not rude, but they could have been more helpful.[SEP]if i ever go back, i will avoid the " world ii tower " at all costs.[SEP]i don't think i will stay in that thing if they try to drag me up to the room.[SEP]the elevators to the tower were terrible and, everyday, during peak periods, i was stuck waiting forever and then riding in a packed elevator.[SEP]awful.[SEP]also, the room had no view... literally.[SEP]the view out the window was of a wall about two feet outside the window.[SEP]the pools were shallow, but nice and not overly crowded.[SEP]and the parking was great... very convenient and only a short walk to the inside of the hotel.[SEP]the price was quite good, but with the price, we got what we paid for too.[SEP]next time, i will definitely pony up the extra $10 per night to stay elsewhere, but this was still a good deal.
0	location- about 10 - 15 minute combined bus and sky train journey to main attractions which was ok as only cost 9 dollars per day per person.[SEP]breakfast- was ok, very basic help yourself cereal, toast, pastries and juice etc.[SEP]room- was fine, nothing special but in comparison was cheap.[SEP]bed comfy, and everything was clean.[SEP]overall- not bad for money, quiet hotel.[SEP]location has ups and downs as was a fair distance from downtown but had supermarket close by.
0	the hotel doesn't look as advertized on their website, charging you for daily parking even though you park on the hotel grounds, location was horrible because you constantly heard jets and helicopters flying, even late at night, stayed in this hotel because mainly of free buffet breakfast but food was disgusting, couple days old potato which they served daily, not many choices and grouchy servers.[SEP]plus they make you sign a tab even though you're not charged they said its for accounting purposes.[SEP]however, i think it just the way they get a tip for their grouchy servers.[SEP]we were woken up one night by the guests next door to our room being loud at 2 in the morning.[SEP]tried room service one night, food was disgusting, almost throw up!!!!
0	a little run down but rooms were quite spacious.[SEP]average service, average continental breakfast.[SEP]didn't really like the location - not within walking distance of any nice shops or restaurants![SEP]we hired a car (a service that the hotel provides) which is a must in la - unless you don't mind spending lots of money on cabs!![SEP]the hotel is close to a metro station but we didn't even bother with the metro / public transport - even the staff at the hotel told us that the public transport system in la is crap![SEP]won't be staying here again on my next trip to la.
0	our first 2 nights in rome was at this hotel.[SEP]it was a night mare to get to even in the day time because we happen to be at the time the metro accident occured.[SEP]struggled to get to hotel by bus, numerous changes... ended up taking a taxi 15 euros from bus stop near termini station.[SEP]on first impressions this hotel is in a quiet residential district but very hilly roads and a little isolated.[SEP]the rooms were decent with double glazing but the bathroom only had a small shower.[SEP]the breakfast is good compare to the grand ritz, with scrambled eggs and bacon.[SEP]freshly made coffee / tea /chocolate.[SEP]the location is not brilliant altought there is the train fr3 stop appiano right behind the hotel.[SEP]the trains are infrequent, and stop early at night 10 pm max.[SEP]on our first night we caught the mr2 bus (in place of the metro routes) to the train stop valle aurelia, but discovered the last train had departed 15mins ago.[SEP]thought we could walk it back to the hotel, but got terribly lost... ended up asking a local restaurant to call a taxi for us.... didn't get back till 11:30pm.[SEP]definitely not a good idea to stay here if you want late nights out.[SEP]all in all i would give this hotel an upper 3 star if minus the breakfast + service.[SEP]the hotel does provide a free shuttle 9-seater merc vito to the vatican + castle santangelo a day.[SEP]2 in the mornings 9 am + 10 am and 6 pm.
0	i stayed in their one bedroom suite which i shared with someone.[SEP]upon check in, our room was not ready so we asked that they hold our bags.[SEP]when we came back, we discovered that our bags had been kept in the public hallway (where the mailboxes are) the whole time![SEP]they advised us that new keys had been cut, and it may take a few trys for it to work.[SEP]after many trys, we got the doorman - who couldn't get it open after several minutes - huge inconvenience![SEP]the room was spacious and the kitchen equipped with the barest of essentials - 2 cups, 3 plates, 4 forks, 1 knife.[SEP]the bathroom appeared to be clean until you closed the door and saw that behind the door was covered in mold.[SEP]i chose to stay on the pullout - typical type bed, uncomfortable, but a bed alas.[SEP]we did have to ask for extra towels as they did not replace ours, even though we left them on the floor.[SEP]when they brought extra towels (we explained that we needed 2 sets) they only brought one.[SEP]the location of the hotel is in a very nice quiet neighborhood about 4 blocks from the subway.[SEP]if you like peace and quiet, but have to stay in the city, this is a good location.[SEP]there are several delis and cafes within walking distance but not much else, as this is mostly a residential area.
0	i stayed here with my wife sometime ih june..[SEP]the room we got had an a separate tiny living room and desk with a door separating the bedroom.there was a half bath in the first room which was good but it had no exhaust..[SEP]poor design overall the room size was adequate, but then again they don't want you to get too comfortable.... this is a casino after all first and foremost![SEP]the pool is probably the best on the strip but it's noisy and busy so if you want peace and quiet you're out of luck.[SEP]location wise it's at the far end of the strip away from all the action elevators are slow but maybe we caught it at a bad time.[SEP]overall the rooms are clean comfortable well appointed, elegant to a degree, but for a little more, you could be at the four seasons in the same complex which is night and day as far as i'm concerned
0	more like a two star hotel... i've been using tripadvisor for years and i've always found it to be fairly spot on![SEP]but not this time.[SEP]this hotel was listed as the 3rd best hotel in madrid based on a number of factors and hence, the reason why we booked it.[SEP]we paid approximately 680eur for four nights which was the greatest rip off ever![SEP]when it comes to location, its central enough but only if you do nt mind walking past loads of prostitues outside your hotel at night.[SEP]the first room they checked us into was towards the back of the hotel and the only good thing we could say about it was that it was quiet.[SEP]but talk about dingy!!![SEP]it was so dark and depressing, there's no way i could have stayed there for four nights so i asked at reception to be changed.[SEP]they moved us the next morning to a room at the front of the hotel but the noise from the main street was just ridiculous.[SEP]the furniture in both rooms was the cheapest ikea type furniture you've ever seen.[SEP]there's really nothing good that i can say about this hotel.[SEP]when i pay to stay in a four star hotel, i expect it to be four star but this was more like a two star.[SEP]and this was no where near the standard of a two star hotel!
0	the room was fine.[SEP]small but clean and in good condition.[SEP]everything worked.[SEP]the hotel is in a bad location, on a busy corner.[SEP]it is dark and the service is nothing special.[SEP]still it is a clean, basic accommodation.
0	excellent value, very clean, still glitzy although a few miles south of the main vegas strip.[SEP]very similar to orleans casino - formerly their sister hotel, also reviewed - but a bit more sophisticated.[SEP]spacious room with excellent decor, all the amenities - hair dryer, phone in twelve - foot bathroom - and more interesting pool.[SEP]cons: location is limiting without a car ; local and 800 calls start at $1 each ; internet charges outrageous at $12 daily your pc or $11 hourly for their shared pc.[SEP]this review is limited as only stayed for one day and used few facilities or food.
0	i loved this hotel i loved this hotel for a few reasons.[SEP]it was beautifully decorated in cooling stone and had comfortable rooms.[SEP]i had a lovely view of a field with cows in it and felt instantly bali - ised.[SEP]the hotel was not overly large, which was perfect for us and the pool and spa was lovely.[SEP]it felt very balinese.[SEP]we enjoyed the food here and ate lots of meals by the pool without any complaints (even our son loved the food which was a mix of asian and western).the place is away from the crowded tourists areas which i liked and was really peaceful and relaxing.[SEP]the bar was nice and the barman super friendly.[SEP]the only issue for me was the location.[SEP]it was far from everything though you could walk down the road through the nusa dua shops.[SEP]we got ripped off with getting a driver (dumb tourists that we are) and paid twice what we paid in ubud.[SEP]in the end it didn't matter too much ; just getting absorbed in holiday costs and i felt the hotel was worth it as a great place to come back to and chill out.[SEP]forget the beach though ; unless they've cleaned it up.[SEP]they drive you out to their stretch of beach and it's filled with rubbish.[SEP]really not sure why they bothered with that... mind you we were there before tourism took off again and so everyone was stretched ; they may have just neglected the beach at that time and it may be better now.
0	we wanted to stay in this hotel for one weekend.[SEP]reservation was made 2 months before arrival date, two days before arrival send an email to confirm again my booking and let them know we would arrive in the evening, this was no problem, confirmed.[SEP]when we arrived the man at the lobby said we were te last ones who have booked a room (2 months ago??).[SEP]no room available.[SEP]they offered to pay for a cab and go to another hotel, same owner.[SEP]not amused.[SEP]the boy was not able to show the other hotel, which was strange, so after a while i looked at it myself online.[SEP]luckily a women showed up, she was very very sorry for the inconvenience and made a deal to book a room in the other hotel with big discount.[SEP]in the end that hotel (stay inn, which has recently been opened) was ok, location even better (city centre), poor poor breakfast but nice staff and nice rooms in great building.[SEP]the way the boy treated us is killing for this hotels reputation, which is a pity, as i do believe the hotel has a lot of potential.[SEP]i do hope we will see the stay inn in this list soon![SEP]thanks to the woman who has helped us at the 21.[SEP]the weekend turned out perfect.
0	disappointed my family and i went to new orleans in early november.[SEP]it was our first trip back (we visit new orleans on average twice a year) since the hurricane.[SEP]i booked accomodations at the maison dupuy based on the above - average reviews on trip advisor.[SEP]we were sorely disappointed.[SEP]we were not given the rooms i specifically reserved, and confirmed.[SEP]the rooms we were given were not ready when we arrived, the front desk personnel were rude, and when we requested a crib (which i also reserved ahead of time) we were treated as if we were being too demanding.[SEP]also, i don't think it is a great location at all.[SEP]the other side of bourbon street, closer to jackson square is a better location in the quarter.[SEP]we checked out of the maison dupuy the morning after we checked in and moved to the windsor court, which was lovely.
0	we booked our one - night stay at the wyndham through a " deep discount site for $100.[SEP]the hotel is beautiful.[SEP]the location is one block away from the mag mile, so you're in prime tourist location.[SEP]the interior of the hotel is gorgeous.[SEP]our room was clean, well - decorated.[SEP]the bathroom was plain, strangely laid out and didn't seem up to par for a hotel like the wyndham (more like a holiday inn bathroom, honestly) but the bed was incredibly comfortable and soft (thread count: 100000???).[SEP]our view was of.... a big fat gray wall (we think maybe they gave us a less desirable room because we booked through the deep discount site?).[SEP]we thought the hotel was beautiful, but for the listed price of this hotel (around $300 on a weeknight), it could have been way nicer.[SEP]internet cost extra ($11/day!!) and parking was $30/day.[SEP]and don't even get me started on breakfast prices.[SEP]also, the staff was less than cordial most of the time, sometimes downright rude.[SEP]for the listed price of the wyndham, i think you could do better.[SEP]however, if you're considering booking through a deep discount site like hotwire or priceline, then i think it's absolutely worth it.[SEP]pros: beautiful hotel / nice interior, well - decorated rooms, comfy beds cons: boring / plain / unexceptional bathrooms, high fees for internet, breakfast and parking, cranky staff.
0	i really don't get it![SEP]i chose this hotel, mainly because of the reviews in this page.[SEP]i found the location bad, yes quiet, that it is, but def.[SEP]not a " cool " or " cute " or anything location.[SEP]the staff was terrible, the lobby and the rest of the hotel def.[SEP]missing personality.[SEP]way too expensive for what we got.[SEP]the room was a nice size, ammenitites terrible, comfy bed, worst view ever.
0	so my boyfriend and i decided to check out the hub motel because it was in a great location and decent prices.[SEP]we arrive and the clerk barely speaks english, which we didn't really mind at first.[SEP]we got our room key and headed upstairs.[SEP]first off, the bed had no fitted sheet on the mattress, only a flat sheet with a comforter and pillows.[SEP]therefore, every time we would move on the bed, the sheets would move as well.[SEP]as i got up to use the bathroom, the sheets had moved along with the pillows, and i looked down and i saw a huge blood stain on the mattress.[SEP]i was speechless.[SEP]i made my boyfriend look at it to make sure it really was blood, instead maybe wine or some sort of liquid.[SEP]it definitely appeared to be blood.[SEP]at this point, i was freaking out.[SEP]i was up the whole night, trying to pick up other things that are wrong with the room.[SEP]the curtains in the room were torn and ripped in various spots, and the carpet beneath the curtain had another blood stain (near the window.). disgusting.[SEP]we happened to leave the next morning before the check out time.[SEP]later that day, my boyfriend called the police and reported what we have encountered at the hub motel.[SEP]police said they were going to send 2 cars to check it out.[SEP]and that was the last that i heard.[SEP]so, please don't ever stay here.[SEP]i honestly will never forget that night.
0	although the location is prime, i am currently suffering from bed bug bites all over my body.[SEP]i have carried them to my brother's apartment after moving out of the hotel and now my brother's apartment is also infested.[SEP]this is the worse place to stay, with terrible service and very lazy workers.[SEP]my parents and i threw out nuts and other food into the rubbish bin and we saw our cleaner sit on the bed, watching tv, and eating our thrown - out food.[SEP]i have a casting tomorrow and it looks like my chances are ever slimmer due to this horrible, infested, uncomfortable inn.
0	i stayed here with my staff (had 6 rooms booked) for a weekend convention.[SEP]it is not in the best part (nor the really bad) of vancouver but walk one block either way and you are in prime tourist area.[SEP]quick stroll to canada place, gastown.[SEP]we ended up loving the location![SEP]valet parking was $27.00, which is normal for downtown vancouver and worth every penny.[SEP]car was right there within minutes of ordering it.[SEP]staff in whole hotel were charming and really went out of their way to make sure our stay was good.[SEP]suites were large enough as were the bathrooms and beds were comfortable.[SEP]elevator had to be carded before they allowed guests to go up and sometimes they didn't work, using after using the elevator phone they magically worked.[SEP]internet was a added charge through ours was comped but i think internet should be included in the price, most hotels already do this.[SEP]i am already planning to return here next year and would advise my friends and family to use this hotel.[SEP]we all enjoyed our stay.:)
0	it was okay... this was our 3rd time to bali and on this trip we stayed in 4 different locations.[SEP]club bali mirage was location number 3.[SEP]it was a honeymoon, the staff was friendly and provided a nice welcome.[SEP]the hotel however was easily 30 years old and the website pictures over sold the property.[SEP]if you plan on staying on the small property and not exploring anything else in the bali than it might be worth your money.[SEP]the all inclusive portion is expensive considering the food was 3/10 at best and the food was recycled.[SEP]on roman day we had lasagne and on greek day the same dish was moussakka.[SEP]secondly, all of the all - inclusive activities are run out of the sister resort, next door quite trouble - some to be jumping between properties and as the sister - resort is larger, newer and fancier most of the guests had occupied the equipment.[SEP]again, we were looking for smaller, intimate etc... but this was largely for people to drink their worth in the all - inclusive, reserve their beach chair for 7 am and not move til midnight etc... bali is known for it's boutique hotels, villa stays and small new places to discover.[SEP]club bali mirage is an average hotel that could be found in cancun mexico, phuket thailand or any other heavily populated tourist beach destination.
0	my girlfriends and i chose this hotel because the location seemed to be good and the price was decent.[SEP]we booked 2 rooms for 2 nights.[SEP]upon arrival, we were placed in 2 small (not adjacent) smoking rooms when we had asked for non smoking.[SEP]the windows did not open in the room and the smell of smoke was nauseating.[SEP]we inquired multiple times about switching rooms and told we were going to be called when a room came available.[SEP]no phone call, no communication whatsoever.[SEP]the location was just okay for our needs.[SEP]not close enough to walk to many of the clubs and bars we were interested in visiting.[SEP]that was our fault for not choosing our hotel location wisely.[SEP]the staff was cordial, and the bartender was very nice offereing suggestions and tips on where to go.[SEP]still they were unwilling to switch us into a non - smoking room which was annoying.[SEP]the rooms were also tiny and perhaps because of the smoke just didn't feel' clean' to me.[SEP]overall the hotel wasn't horrible, but there are better options for the same or a little extra money.[SEP]skip the days inn downtown and explore another option.
0	even if the room was $99 i wouldn't stay here again.[SEP]i'll try to distill a long story into a few salient items.[SEP]1) the building's hvac system is set up so that only air or heat will work at one time - i.e. the building needs to switch to heat downstairs in the boiler room.[SEP]well think about the fall when it's warm during the day and cool at night - since the hotel was still set up for a / c there was no heat![SEP]and no way to get any heat.[SEP]shivering in the room... 2) service is poor for a hotel of this standard.[SEP]was treated curtly by just about everyone.[SEP]3) rooms are a disappointment - they have a few interesting touches, but a lot of empty white walls to stare at.[SEP]felt like i was in a big white box.[SEP]very uncomfortable.[SEP]4) no taxis available -- some others have commented on this and said it was no big deal you just walk 2 - 3 blocks.[SEP]well imagine doing that in a pouring rainstorm or a snowstorm?[SEP]that becomes a major problem.[SEP]5) location -- terrible even for this part of town.[SEP]the lobby bar was the only highlight of the place, but not enough to supercede the above points.[SEP]next time i stay downtown i'll go to the andaz.
0	this hotel needs to be renovated and i'm surprised that a hotel chain as large as the holiday inn is willing to risk their reputation by not attending to this.[SEP]the elevators, carpet, decor, bathroom fixtures are all old.[SEP]this hotel was sold to me through hotwire as a 3 star hotel and it isn't even close.[SEP]i have stayed in other 3 star manhattan hotels that were nicer, better located and cheaper than this.[SEP]the room was clean, mostly - except that one day we came home to a bunch of bits & pieces on the floor that needed to be vacuumed, (we didn't put them there) and clearly the staff forgot to run the machine through the room and left their own mess.[SEP]i have to give some credit to the bed - we did sleep well.[SEP]i also give full marks to the concierge who was very helpful.[SEP]we did not use room service.[SEP]the television is horrible - the regular stations fade in and fade out to the point where you get so angry that you decide to buy a movie - which, i suppose is what they want you to do.[SEP]the location isn't great for the theatre district - its a pretty long walk if the weather is too hot, too cold or too rainy - but a little too short to justify a cab.[SEP]i've stayed in 6 manhattan hotels and this was the worst one.[SEP]good hotels at a reasonable price to exist there - but this one needs to make some improvements before it can be counted in that group.
0	this is a typical novotel, the only thing amiss is plastic cups in the rooms instead of glasses, however inexpensive.[SEP]location is a problem however.[SEP]it's in south amsterdam, half an hour's drive from the centre, next to the zuid station.[SEP]you can get there direct from schiphol airport either by train or by car, no need to go to the centre at all.[SEP]it is supposed to be close to the train station, but it isn't really, not if you've got any luggage.[SEP]the business district of zuidas is a 20-minute vigorous walk.[SEP]the hotel is basically in the middle of nowhere, with just residential streets around it.[SEP]not even a shopping centre really close, no next door restaraunts or cafes or anything.[SEP]why they built it there i can't understand.[SEP]if you're there for the business district, try the crown plaza, or maybe hilton or the one across the street from it -- its a much shorter walk.
0	i spent two nights at this rather unimpressive hilton.[SEP]the location is not near the interesting tourist areas nor any of several international conference centers, but does have a convenient metro nearby.[SEP]the staff was uniformly nice, helpful and able to communicate in english - this was really the best feature of the hotel.[SEP]the lobby was very nice, but elevators small and not always working.[SEP]the room was small but ok size for european standards, but in need of renovation, or at least painting.[SEP]no iron or other useful amenities in room, very expensive internet access (23 euro daily for mediocre connection).[SEP]the bathroom was clean and everything worked well.[SEP]the bed wasn't bad, but not one of the best, although several nice pillows helped.[SEP]no pool and tiny ill - equipped gym.[SEP]the breakfast was included in my package but was more appropriate for a 2 - 3 star hotel - bad weak coffee and limited, below average quality buffet.[SEP]pricy, uninteresting lunch and dinner menus, which i didn't try, but meals at meeting not high quality.[SEP]overall, not so bad for the brief meeting i attended, but i would choose somewhere else.
0	i would look elsewhere first.[SEP]however, if you can't find what you desire in the way of value and location this is a pretty decent hotel.[SEP]good - unique building.[SEP]it is a remodeled bank building so it is pretty unique architecture.[SEP]the rooms are very nice and clean, although maybe a bit cramped.[SEP]no more than two to a room.[SEP]the breakfast is adequate, the service very good and the staff is friendly.[SEP]a microwave and refrigerator are nice additions.[SEP]bad - location is horrible.[SEP]very little parking and it is marginally secured.[SEP]the neighborhood is pretty questionable, i would not venture out at night - period.[SEP]there are no restaurants or services within 2 or 3 blocks.[SEP]also when i got up the next morning, i noticed that my room door would open without a key, just a sharp push on the door and it spung open.[SEP]the door frame looked like it had been forced before and the lock was not secure.[SEP]if you can't find something else, this place is very nice, but it is not on my " return to " list
0	the hotel was clean, the staff was very helpful and kind.[SEP]the location is the biggest problem.[SEP]it is a pretty long, walk to the subway or times square.[SEP]the neighborhood is not the best, but i wouldn't really say it was bad.[SEP]i don't recommend it for a first timer.[SEP]we didn't have the noise problem at night but we were on the backside of the building.[SEP]the rooms are pretty small.[SEP]but we booked throught priceline and the price was right.
0	first of all, this hilton is ok as a hotel - rooms are all right, service is sort of all right, restaurant and bar are a bit gloomy but all right, and the location is grim but ok if you have to be away from miami beach for business.[SEP]for the price, it's ok, nothing more.[SEP]main objection was an absolutely ludicrous bill we received for use of phone in the room - $20 usd flat rate for making a call even when it didn't connect, and about $17usd per minute for international calls.[SEP]we all know hotel phones are pricey, so we kept the calls short, but even still - the rates aren't advertised anywhere in the room.[SEP]coming from europe, it takes some time to get used to the " rip me off at every corner " culture in the states, but this was just going too far.[SEP]really abusive.[SEP]so the hotel - fine, for the cost, if you have to be downtown, it's an ok choice.[SEP]phone - don't go near it.
0	not only is this hotel designed for teenagers and twenty - somethings it is apparently also run by them.[SEP]i did not encounter one intelligent adult who could solve any problem or complaint during my entire stay.[SEP]their over - reliance on cutesy nomenclature is not cute or hip but simply annoying (i'm not going to call the elevator a lift no matter how many times you repeat it).[SEP]i have concluded that this hotel is for rubes who think it's chic and/or hip ; it's not.[SEP]i would have to say though that my chief complaint was the use of cheap materials in the guest rooms.[SEP]bed covers with snags and holes and chipped fiber board and plastic veneer furniture does not wear well and makes the whole hotel look cheap and tacky.[SEP]i really think this is the reason for the blindingly low lighting throughout.[SEP]prices for mini - bar or room service are laughably expensive.[SEP]as far as the location --- i have only myself to blame ; as a new yorker i try to avoid that entire area.[SEP]never again for times square or the w chain.
0	this is the home of barry manilow and star trek - the experience.[SEP]those are the two only reasons i can think that anyone would want to stay at this hotel.[SEP]it was dirty.[SEP]my boyfriend wore his flip flops in the shower.[SEP]i don't think the rooms have been renovated (or possibly even cleaned) since the original star trek was aired in prime time and barry was singing the copa cobana the first time around.[SEP]the location is a bit far off the strip - at the very end.[SEP]you can catch the monorail (which is pricey) to the middle - and then catch the deuce (bus) for a couple bucks which runs up and down the strip all the way into the old vegas area (freemont street).[SEP]i was there for work - my boy friend tagged along because it was vegas.[SEP]i'm not a gambler - but he is - and was not impressed with the poker room at the hilton (which didn't, incidentally, stop him from spending at least 7 hours sitting in there playing poker - so i'd take that with a grain of salt).[SEP]not a terrible place to stay - and they do occasionally have what appear to be great rates - but it's not convenient and really did appear tired and old.[SEP]we're heading back to vegas and we're not staying there again.
0	check first we have just returned after a 5 day stay at this hotel.[SEP]we chose it due to the out of town location, hoping to chill by the pool in nice garden settings!beware the hard plastic loungers did not have any mattress covers on them,.[SEP]so we could not relax as intended.[SEP]when we confronted the hotel they said that the ones they had were 10 yrs old and they might be having some replacements next week.[SEP]no good to us then.[SEP]we had to then travel into barcelona everyday which was quite a distance.[SEP]on our last day my husband asked if he could sit on a chair from the outdoor patio area on the grass as it was more comfortable but they refused.[SEP]also beware of the pickpockets on the metro.[SEP]my husband had his wallet stolen from his buttoned short pockets at the side of his leg.[SEP]only going one stop.... very professional never felt a thing.[SEP]the one member of staff helped with phoning to cancel our debit card.[SEP]otherwise 90% of the staff seemed long faced and unfriendly.
0	if i was coming to downtown orlando for business i would stay here.[SEP]however, i came for a weekend with my husband and i found that the downtown location was not conveniant to parks and other active locations.[SEP]parking is awful, you might as well valet which is pricey.[SEP]the room was large and nice, and the staff was nice (a few a little pretentious).[SEP]honestly felt self conscious because we were dressed casuelly for travel and the staff and other travelers were very dressed up.
0	we ended up at the birbey hotel as part of a tour.[SEP]location: very dodgy.[SEP]not in a great part of town, we felt unsafe.[SEP]rooms: very basic, beds ok, pillows non - existent.[SEP]bathroom, old and a bit grimey.[SEP]service: seemed ok, did nt speak much english.[SEP]value: breakfast was good.[SEP]but you definitely get what you pay for.[SEP]my advice would be stay in a good hostel in a better location and give this one a miss.[SEP]would i stay there again, no.
0	we booked our stay because of the great reviews from tripadvisor and were a little upset.[SEP]we stayed in the attic room with barely enough room to move around.[SEP]we were 2 adults and two children aged 12 & 18.[SEP]the air conditioning was not working the first night we arrived and we did not sleep most of the night.[SEP]the hotel compensated us $100.00 for our troubles.[SEP]however, the air conditioning did not work the second night either and i finally went down at 3 am to notify the reception, who weren't available so we had another sleepless night.[SEP]the bathroom is extremely small, barely enough room to take a shower and i didn't find it especially clean.[SEP]we did find the grounds, location and meals extremely satisfying, and as stated in most of the comments it was a tranquil spot away from the noise of the city.[SEP]we traveled for another 6 weeks after our stay in rome to another region of italy, greece and london and this was our only disappointing accomodation.[SEP]i would definitely find a different hotel for our next stay.
0	the staff was polite.[SEP]that is the only nice thing i can say about this place.[SEP]when they say their rooms are small they aren't kidding - way too small.[SEP]my husband and i couldn't both stand in the room at the same time.[SEP]the shower was a joke - completely unusable - missing a door and too small to even turn around in.[SEP]the location was awful, too far from everything - we had to get taxis everywhere which added up - making this " value " not valuable enough.[SEP]we suggest paying a little more for a better location.
0	the shuttle bus drivers are very good, lovely infact.[SEP]both rich and (i ca nt remember the other ones name small gentleman.very helpful.[SEP]a big thumbs up to them.) the reception staff were ok, and restraunt too, and the food is really good.[SEP]however my fault with the hotel is, that nowhere on any site does it state how far out the hotel is, (having to pay 20dollers a taxi for nearly every ride out.) also it should state more on sites about the 100dollers the hotel hold a day!!![SEP]incase of damages![SEP]i would nt of booked this hotel if ide known that.[SEP]which is ridiculous, especially when on own as i was left with no money to get anywhere.[SEP]the reception did let me use the phone at the desk to try contact my travel company and ask the hotel to release some of the money but they said it would take 2days so this was no help.[SEP]i would nt stay again because of the location and the hold on the amount of money per night.[SEP]food and staff nice though and rooms ok too.[SEP]tasha
0	we chose this place wanting not to stay on the strip and so ironically the cribs that i have is exactly relating to the location.[SEP]vegas is gigantic in scale and so walking to the strip and then walking across the strip is a pain task.[SEP]so i would say that there are distinct merits on staying on the strip which this place does not offer.[SEP]other wise if a quicker check in, lesser crowds, and some quiet is what you are looking for, then this is a good option.[SEP]since we went in december, we never used the pool but it i d not appear as exotic as some of the pool scapes of other larger places.[SEP]breakfast was bit of a mayhem as everyone scrambled to ensure that they load up for most part of the day.[SEP]not sure whether to blame the hotel or patrons for creating a fairly annoying experience in the morning.[SEP]rooms are neat, spacious as a studio and have good amneties.[SEP]beds are comfortable and the bathrooms are spacious and neat.[SEP]lady at the tourist desk was a big help and would defnitely consider as a big boon for tourists as you mull varioius choices of shows, canyon trips etal so overall go for it, if you do nt fancy staying on the strip.
0	really not the best.[SEP]room was basic, noisy at night, shower in the corner of room, communal toilets, no lift, expensive internet facility.[SEP]this is not a hotel it is a hostel.[SEP]if it were to charge hostel prices it would nt be too bad.[SEP]ok location, not very easy to find after a hot and stressful trip from the train station look for something better is my advise
0	stayed here for 2 weeks (booked initially for 4).[SEP]the location is still pretty much a building site across dubai internet city, next to street 611 in the greens.[SEP]the views are either onto the next block, the building site or sheik zayed road - so not really appealing.[SEP]we booked a 1 room apartment - the pictures of the hotel on their web site are for real: the rooms are soo dark, you have to have the lights on during the whole day.[SEP]the airco was so noisy and windy, that we had to turn it off to prevent headaches.[SEP]the room service was ok, they even cleaned the dirty dishes.[SEP]if you have to stay on a budget (around 16,000aed per month) and don't mind looking on a building site / busy street, it might be ok
0	i stayed here as part of a cosmos tour in may 2009.[SEP]the reception staff could be more friendly as i had asked for a map and directions to central rome.[SEP]with some boredom, they pulled out a map and started explaining how to get here and there.[SEP]the room was all right since i was not expecting too much.[SEP]everything worked though the shower curtain didn't prevent water from spilling over onto the bathroom floor.[SEP]the only complaint i had was its location - located in the suburbs.[SEP]you had to walk out of the hotel to take a bus to an interchange and take the train from there.[SEP]alternatively an express bus near the hotel (5 to 10 mins walk) takes you directly into central rome via vatican city, it's around 30 minutes.[SEP]going to central rome was all right, but going back to the hotel was slightly more difficult as the bus goes through a different street.[SEP]thankfully we asked the locals who were more than willing to help us out.
0	worst hotel i've ever stayed in![SEP]was unfortunate enough to spend 2 nights in this scar of a hotel.[SEP]the staff were very rude and un - courteous (which is something i found at most places in singapore) the room simply reeked of cigarettes![SEP]the bathroom looked well worn but looked clean.[SEP]i skipped the meager breakfast offered with the room on both mornings.[SEP]it was far away from anything.[SEP]a member of our group had inadvertently shifted one of the seats in the lobby while waiting for our ride, just as she reached the door to leave she was rudely asked to move the seat back the few inches to its original location.[SEP]send only your enemies to stay here, we got only an unqualified apology from our travel agent.[SEP]and don't believe the decietfully designed hotel web site!
0	i have worked in amsterdam for many years and always stayed at this hotel until they developed a bug problem last year.[SEP]it never was the greatest hotel in the world but i am not fussy, the location was good and it was relatively cheap.[SEP]i m not sure what s happened but i believe the bugs are coming up the sink and bathroom pipes and infested the rooms.[SEP]i got eaten alive one night there and gave them another chance.[SEP]when i went back a month later the same thing happened again.[SEP]this time i got up, had a shower and left.[SEP]i was able to see little black bugs and tiny green flie type insects.[SEP]i knew that in the gap between me first getting eaten and the second time (which was a different room) there had to be hundreds of people who suffered the same horrible experience.[SEP]i to had to see the doc and get anti biotics to rid the horrendous itching and lumps that were all over my body and face, not so good when you have to present yourself at work.[SEP]anyway, my advice is look elsewhere unless you want to stay awake all night sleeping in your clothes or walking out all scratchy to find another hotel.
0	me and my partner booked into the alexandra hotel for 2 nights.[SEP]we wanted somewhere basic where we could rest our heads in a clean room.[SEP]booking in we were told we were not in the alexandra but the seymour hotel a few minutes up the road.[SEP]this was fine by us, but arriving here we were told we were in the' white house hotel' around the corner, and breakfast was in the basement of the seymour hotel.[SEP]when we got into the room it was not like the internet photos of a clean and very basic room, it was basic with a bathroom like that of a caravan, still fine.[SEP]but the sheets were covered in period blood, the bed had not been changed since the previous guests stayed there and the room smelled awful.[SEP]we complained to the receptionist who, after 15minutes could not even remembered we had checked in with him![SEP]room is unsanitary and location is okay, but for a couple quid more we got the kings cross travel lodge (there is two we got the cheapest) which was basic but clean!
0	plush hotel but rooms cramped rooms were cramped at this place.[SEP]location was so so since space is a premium in hk.[SEP]not much room to even turn around in the rooms with the beds in place.[SEP]quite claustrophobic but it might just be because we did nt want to pay an exhorbitant rates.[SEP]the area is on the subway line but looks kind of run down in the day time.[SEP]easy to get to shopping districts but if you want to get to the famed outlet districts its best to take a cab which are reasonably priced.
0	was staying at this hotel for 5 nights and i had a very good stay, i must say.[SEP]the room itself was big and had alot of space.[SEP]free internet is also a plus.[SEP]you can also use the safe in your room for 10 euros in deposit.[SEP]the toilet was good and so were the shower.[SEP]the service in the reception was also great.[SEP]went down to the reception to get an extra towel, and they sent me the towel up to the room 10 minutes later.[SEP]the only negative thing with this hotel is the location.[SEP]you have to walk about ten minutes to the closest underground station urgell.[SEP]the barcelona sants station is about 15 mins walk.
0	this hotel was ok -- but nothing special.[SEP]i stayed 6 nights for a big conference that was in town.[SEP]i got the impression that the hotel was nice a few years ago but suffered a bit with katrina.[SEP]the staff was very friendly and polite.[SEP]the room was nice -- clean and fairly big.[SEP]it was pretty loud though -- seems like the walls are a bit thin.[SEP]plus the cleaning people were extremely loud -- talking very, very loudly in the hall starting at 8:00am daily.[SEP]other guests were loud, too -- there was yelling at the pool, plus banging and other very loud noises from the floor above and room next door.[SEP]this isn't the hotel's fault per se, but it did make my stay less pleasant.[SEP]two other minor problems: the business center lost a package sent to me they had signed for, and one day my room wasn't cleaned and the staff showed up around 7 pm to clean.[SEP]the location of the hotel is ok -- a bit shady, though, due to the number of vacant and boarded up buildings nearby.[SEP]the proximity to the french quarter was great, though -- a very easy walk.[SEP]i was hesitant to walk alone after dark in the area, though.[SEP]the section of canal st.[SEP]the hotel is near is pretty sketchy.
0	do not stay at the marriott residence inn![SEP]the hotel is subpar at best with the price you pay to stay there.[SEP]one can easily find a better hotel with more space at the rates they charge.[SEP]i was charged $399 for a king size bed, but all the room sizes are apparently the same.[SEP]the mattress was not firm and the towels were the cheap kind that shed.[SEP]the view from the hotel was pretty crappy too - a building wall stood outside my window.[SEP]they claim to be a smoke free hotel, but my room smelled like cigarettes when i got there, and to top it off, they charged me an additional $250 after i checked out claiming that i smoked in the room!![SEP]the manager there was very indifferent about the charge and refused to take it off.[SEP]about the only thing i liked about my stay there was the location since it's right in the heart of midtown (near the theater district and macys / shopping area), but again, not worth it.[SEP]i usually stay in the hotels in times square (like marquis, millenium, w, etc), not near times square, and i will never stay at this hotel again.[SEP]i'm quite surprised by some of the great reviews this hotel has gotten.[SEP]frequent travelerfirenze, italy
0	the lobby was amazing in this hotel.[SEP]i was not really impressed with the room.[SEP]i am not sure what room is in the pictures on the website but it was not the standard queen room.[SEP]it was ok for one night but i wouldn't recommend it for an extended stay.[SEP]this hotel is close to the convention center and sports arena but not much else.[SEP]the staff was very helpful.[SEP]i would not stay here again, but not because of the staff.[SEP]mainly because of the location and the not - so - great room.
0	found this through tripadvisor, but as a first time traveler to london (and europe), it was a little out of the way for daily visits to london.[SEP]and with all the work being done on the trains, it made for interesting adventures maneuvering through above ground and underground.[SEP]it is only a few yards away from a train station, which is good though, if the trains are running there.[SEP]the hotel itself is more of a professional / business looking hotel as opposed to one for leisure travel.[SEP]i asked if we could get two beds instead of the one king we booked and she upgraded us to a suite with a door that separated a single and a queen.[SEP]the shower was nice and the bathroom was clean.[SEP]the only bad thing was that you had to pay for internet.[SEP]the hotel is i believe a mile or two from london city center, so you definitely have to invest anywhere from 15 - 30 minutes (depending on the time of day and what lines are open / closed that day), for travel into / out of london.[SEP]can't really fault it for its location, and the price was good (less than $150/night, which was around our budget).[SEP]other than that, the stay was nice and the rooms were comfortable, and there's a small town about 15 minute walk away.[SEP]nothing's really open at night though.
0	i had a generally okay stay at this hotel although i likely will not go back again.[SEP]as other people have said, the hotel is literally several feet away from the elevated freeway and cars zip by the 3rd floor window.[SEP]the noise level varies from barely noticeable to extremely loud depending on your exact location and floor, so cross your fingers and hope you get a good room good: - nice staff - newly renovated rooms have updated bathrooms and furniture - fairly close to downtown by car bad: - some rooms very loud due to proximity to freeway - rooms very small.[SEP]- no counter space in bathroom at all.[SEP]i had to leave items outside on the bed and walk back and forth between the sink and the bed.[SEP]- not enough parking.[SEP]throughout all the days i was there, the number of cars exceeded the number of available spaces.[SEP]guests were forced to double up on spaces and leave their keys with the front desk.
0	cleanest bathrooms in europe the hotel rooms and service were nice.[SEP]the bathrooms were immaculate![SEP]i couldn't believe, cleaner than my own..[SEP]and a nice size for european standards.[SEP]breakfast was good, but not great selections... not very breakfasty for american standards.[SEP]however, they claim to have a / c, but they never used it.[SEP]it was some of the worst sleep we've had and we really needed it after long days of walking and sightseeing.[SEP]sleeping with the windows open wouldn't have been bad if not for the extremely noisy street the hotel is on and it's location in mosquitoville.[SEP]my husband and i were covered in mosquito bites each morning (seriously 30 + each).[SEP]the hotel management couldn't believe we had difficulty sleeping, there were no other rooms anyway.
0	this was the first hotel that my sister and i stayed at in rome.[SEP]we were only there for about three days all up (so not a very long time).[SEP]the best thing about the place was the staff, they were nice and helpfull which is what you need the most when you are travelling.[SEP]the rooms were fine and the bathrooms were about average.[SEP]the lift like many of the hotels in europe was small, so you either have to be patient or go up and down the stairs, i did nt mind but i guess some people would.[SEP]the location wasn't the best but it meant that it was closer to the parts of rome that other tourists wouldn't see, and we went to a really nice restaurant that we definitely wouldn't have gone to otherwise.[SEP]oh and the breakfast was pretty good too.[SEP]i didn't book the hotel myself because it was part of a tour (i did rate it average because i thought that would be fair), but that s not to say that i wouldn't go back.[SEP]and the only reason i would nt recommend it to a friend is because it wasn't fantastic.
0	we needed to be down by the airport for a conference but the conference hotel was full.[SEP]the glowing reviews made us give cedarbrook lodge a try.[SEP]and we were so glad.[SEP]it is beautiful, serene, wonderful - you'd never believe you are near the airport.[SEP]the airport location, while convenient for travel or conferences, means that you are not close to downtown seattle.[SEP]that said, i would seriously consider staying at cedarbrook and just planning for the commute into seattle on a future trip.[SEP]it is that nice!
0	the quest potts point was everything it was advertised to be.[SEP]the rooms were modern, clean and well - run.[SEP]the staff was friendly and accommodating - they helped me get oriented when i arrived in sydney, ordered me taxis when i needed them, and gave good recommendations for restaurants.[SEP]potts point is centrally located in sydney, which made it convenient to many of the sights i wanted to see.[SEP]in terms of micro - location, i agree with some other posters who say that the hotel is too close to the nightlife district in king's cross, which is a bit seedy in the view of a woman traveling alone.[SEP]still, the pros far outweigh the one con, and i would stay here again.[SEP]for the price, it's hard to beat.
0	no service and flooding at the kraft date: june 6, 2007reviewer: tripadvisor user from californiaindifferecne reigns supreme at the kraft hotel![SEP]we traveled with a small group to florence in june and experienced a few days of rain.[SEP]one afternoon the rain was heavy for an hour or so and several people in our group found their rooms flooded (at no fault of their own)![SEP]the management did nothing to help these people, let alone move them or offer to compensate them for ruined items -- they couldn't care less -- after all, florence is a city filled with tourists who have to stay somewhere so there is no incentive to provide good service in the hopes of gaining customer loyalty or positive word of mouth.[SEP]front desk people also failed to pass on phone messages or provide us help with our luggage.[SEP]the rooms are just average -- some quite small and strange, and the public spaces provide potential but never seem to be used (i.e., a bar in the lobby area and a rooftop bar).[SEP]the breakfast was horrible -- mostly canned, boxed and wrapped items.[SEP]in a country like italy, why do so many hotels provide canned fruit and juice concentrates?[SEP]the location, while quiet, is far from the action.[SEP]because florence is a tourist town, prices are high and service is often spotty, but i'm sure one could find a better hotel than the kraft.
0	the trump seems like a good idea-- very low rates ($85 gets you a room and an upgrade to a 1 bedroom suite) and the rooms are very nicely put together.[SEP]the problem is that the upside ends there.[SEP]the location is not good at all.[SEP]to get to the strip, you need to either walk through the fashion show mall, or on fashion show blvd., which has no sidewalks because it's a construction site.[SEP]there isn't nearly enough staff to run the place properly-- nobody to hail you a cab at the curb, nobody to open the doors when you enter, nobody to help you with your bags, and so forth.[SEP]any request from room service or housekeeping took more than an hour to fulfill, without fail.[SEP]very disappointed.[SEP]i was definitely left with the impression that i didn't get a deal-- i got what i paid for.
0	the hotel was recently (2 - 3 yrs) renovated and though the rooms are a bit small, they are very clean and modern: flat panel tv, two - tone paint, halogen reading lights over the beds, white subway tile in the bath, and a rainfall shower head.[SEP]our room was on the halsted street side, and away from the highway.[SEP]though we were close to the interstate, there was no issue with noise.[SEP]our only issue was location.[SEP]the hotel is about 5 blocks out of the west loop, and roughly the same distance to the nearest subway station.[SEP]between cta, cabs and walking, chicago is a very easy city to get around.[SEP]just know that you will be away from the primary business area as well as the major tourist areas.[SEP]we booked based on price and got the room for about $225 night (including taxes and fees) from an orbitz package deal.[SEP]if you are trying to stretch the budget a bit and don't mind walking a few extra blocks, this place is fine.[SEP]if you want to be in the heart of the city, look for a place on michigan ave.
0	i stayed in the hotel for 1 night on september 25, 2011.[SEP]the hotel is modern and clean.[SEP]the rooms are spacious, modern and clean.[SEP]the price is excellent.[SEP]the hotel provides a free shuttle service to and from the airport which is a must.[SEP]the location is terrible.[SEP]it is located near the airport but in an industrial area.[SEP]there are no cafes, restaurants or shops nearby.[SEP]to get to the center of the city you have to take the shuttle back to the airport and take the metro to town.[SEP]near by a 10 minute walk there is a big shopping center with a huge food court but you have to ask how to get there.[SEP]remember on sundays all the stores including supermarkets and pharmacies are closed.[SEP]it is an excellent hotel if you plan to stay one night between flights.
0	we have stayed at the wynn once before and loved it just as much this last time.[SEP]the rooms are beatifully decorated and very spacious.[SEP]you press a button and the lights go dim, a button for the drapes, etc.... very clean and the bathrooms are also luxurious.[SEP]we like the casino, but never win here.[SEP]the slots are tight.[SEP]still had a great time.[SEP]the only draw back is the location, you have a very long walk since the wynn is located at the end of the strip.[SEP]we got a lot of exercise.[SEP]last time we were here we went to the show la reve and it was excellent worth seeing.[SEP]we decided to take a shuttle from the airport and it was not worth saving a few dollars, take a cab.[SEP]the shuttle stops everywhere, even the express!!![SEP]hahahaha
0	my wife and i have been to new orleans a few times for food, art galleries and adult fun (39 years old / no children).[SEP]we got a great deal on a room at le pavillon.[SEP]it is the 1st time we have stayed outside the french quarter - we knew the location when we made the reservation.[SEP]despite the value, we will probably spend more for the convenience of having everything literally outside our door next time we visit.[SEP]the walk from the hotel is about 3 - 4 long blocks - approximately 10 minutes.[SEP]we did not feel unsafe in any way despite the abandoned warehouses / buildings, though the walk was a bit annoying the one day it rained (they have umbrellas in the room, a nice touch for the price).[SEP]we did not eat at the restaurant.[SEP]the bar was fine for a drink.[SEP]the room was clean - we had one small issue with the sink drain that was fixed promptly and discretely while we were out.[SEP]the bell staff was efficient and professional.[SEP]we arrived early in the morning prior to check in and there were no rooms available until check - in time (we requested the front desk to call us when our room was available but they did not).[SEP]good value if that is your priority and you don't mind walking.[SEP]if you don't mind paying a bit more for location and a nicer room, there are better options in new orleans.
0	we stayed at the citizen m for a weekend break to amsterdam.[SEP]the location is good for an airport stop over as it is a 10 minute train ride from schipol.[SEP]however it is a bit out of the centre for a weekend break (20 minute tram ride into town).[SEP]the rooms are funky, modern etc with all the electrics and lighting operated off a single device.[SEP]however if there are two of you staying they can feel a little cramped and there is no hanging space for clothes, so pack light![SEP]on the plus side the sound proofing is really good so despite the rooms being crammed in your sure of a good nights sleep.[SEP]overall a good value, quirky hotel, but one i'd say is best suited for solo travellers staying for one night.
0	my sales team and i stayed here recently for a conference.[SEP]we travel one to two weeks a month.[SEP]this was probably the worst place we have stayed in the last five years.[SEP]the rooms are at the same level as a $69 per night hotel.[SEP]the restaurant had a tiny menu and was very expensive.[SEP]the location was awful, unless you need to be on the interstate in less than five seconds.[SEP]the worst part of the experience was the staff.[SEP]they were friendly but useless.[SEP]no one seemed to know anything about anything.[SEP]on the lighter side, despite the location, there was a van to shuttle where you needed to go.[SEP]there are so many great places to stay in phoenix, this is not one of them.
0	stayed in this hotel for 2 nights.[SEP]the location is not centre but reachable by trams, the journey from central station is about 15 - 20 minutes.[SEP]i'd booked for a single and i found a very small room next to the reception with a separate bathroom.[SEP]so to reach the bathroom i was forced to go out of the room and go to other part of the corridor!!![SEP]when i asked to chenge the room they told me no other rooms were available for that night![SEP]the hotel was noisy, live child screams from other rooms![SEP]the cleanliness was not bad but not wow![SEP]the second room i received for the second night was normal with a very small bathroom.[SEP]the breakfast is normal, enough but nothing special.[SEP]the staff were polite.[SEP]so... for my experience and from other hotels i;ve seen in my trips, sorry but i don't suggest this hotel.[SEP]i should say that there are not too many economical hotels in amsterdam and the room are average expensive but i think you can find something better and maybe closer to the center.
0	the rooms are quite old and moldy, at least that s how it was on ground floor.[SEP]location is not great as it is advertised, its quite a long walk from all the main attractions.[SEP]the breakfast was basi, althoughthey have a nice garden outside, but birds are really annoying since they are used to people there and are continously around the tables.[SEP]the waiters are trying their best to shoo them away.[SEP]there are lots of mosquitos in the garden area.[SEP]either have some insect repellants or sit indoors.[SEP]we had one note of 500euros mysteriosuly![SEP]disappear from our room.[SEP]we had to make several calls before someone showed any attention.[SEP]they were unable to deal professionally at all with our situation.[SEP]best answer they had was you probably lost it somewhere else, which was impossible.[SEP]although i requested to speak to the manager we were told he was not available at night and would get back to us in the morning.[SEP]he did nt even bother to see us or call at least.[SEP]i would have called the police if i was nt in a hurry to catch a flight.[SEP]if you decide to stay here make sure you do nt forget anything valuable laying around in your room.
0	i'll start with the positives - the rooms looked great, were clean, and comfortable.[SEP]now the negatives - i tried to take showers at 3 pm and 5 am and both times had to wait between 15 minutes and a half hour for the water to get warmer than ice cold which i find inexcusable at 250 bucks a night.[SEP]although they offer complimentary coffee on the top floor, a hotel at this price should have in room coffee makers for convenience in the morning.[SEP]the hotel is in manhattan but is really far east and difficult to access public transportation (and hence the rest of new york) from this location.[SEP]it is 15 bucks for 24 hours of wi - fi, i have no idea why its not free like every other hotel in this price range.[SEP]the front desk staff were friendly, but were unable to give even basic instructions to the subway.[SEP]although it is not a pricy hotel by new york standards, i believe you can do a lot better and at least get warm water in the mornings somewhere else.
0	staff not very friendly it was like they treated you as you were not good enough to stay there.[SEP]rooms tiny no room for suit case.[SEP]rooms tiny for new york standard.[SEP]a big tv at the end of the bed which give you a headache as too big for the room.[SEP]bathroom was tiny too small to get dressed in there.[SEP]my friends room they could not even walk past the end of the bed no room and the bathroom door was hanging off.[SEP]overpriced for what you got.[SEP]bad location.[SEP]better at the wellington hotel which has a better location, prcie, frienlt and good room size.[SEP]we were only at the w 1 night then went to the wellington i am so glad we did not choose the w for the whole stay very disappointing as being part of the sheriton group.[SEP]it had trouble calling out in my room so i rang the front desk they saidf i do not know what is wrong and hang up.[SEP]i went to my friends room and used there phone which was ok.[SEP]they do not even have a public phone in the foyer you have to walk down the street.
0	the only thing i liked of this hotel was the bed, everything else was terrible..[SEP]it's not clean as you would expect from a 4 star hotel ; staff is very rude and can't even speak a good english ; the location is bad: far from everything and it's just in front of a mosque, that transmits prayers 24/7 from giant speakers..[SEP]very annoying when you're trying to sleep![SEP]worst toilet i've ever seen, and i've been travelling for months sleeping in hostels everywhere..[SEP]i would definitively not come back to this hotel, and i would not come back to dubai either..
0	the location is not really downtown.[SEP]we tried to take a shuttle from the hotel @ 7:00pm after arriving but it was full until 9:30 pm (too late for dinner).[SEP]we tried again to get back from the theater @ 11:15 pm but it stopped @ 11:00 pm.[SEP]the room had two lights burnt out and we were trapped in an elevator for 10 minutes and walked down the stairs.[SEP](only 2 elevators).[SEP]checked on sunday @ 11:00pm and had to wait 30 minutes for our car.[SEP](only 2 attendants).[SEP]we felt sorry for the long line of people behind us.[SEP]we will be staying somewhere else in the future.
0	we visited dubai and stayed at two different hotels.[SEP]start of our holiday stayed at 4point sheraton on sheikh zahid road.[SEP]that was with a group of five family members a good stay.[SEP]then as my brother and i were left to fly back 2 days later, we changed hotels to sun and sand.[SEP]to start the check in took more than an hour.[SEP]it was manual ; they were calling various people to confirm our booking.[SEP]we had booked and prepaid for our stay via lastminute.[SEP]receptionist was first unable to find any reservation.[SEP]then managed this by calling various offices, she was very unhelpful.[SEP]then demanded to keep our passports, which i refused.[SEP]on the hotel would say it has dated decor.[SEP]the hallways smelled bad, the carpet was old and dirty.[SEP]the room was spacious however, dated decor, bed cover old and dirty.[SEP]due to the smell in the hallway, it was hard to breathe in the room.[SEP]service and room hygiene were poor.[SEP]location is ok.
0	we did not have a lot of choices when we wanted to stay in west seattle, so we chose the grove.[SEP]we made a reservation in advance and specifically asked for a quite room in the back wing away from alaska street.[SEP]instead, when we checked in at 5 pm on a satruday night, they gave us room 201, right on hte corner of alask and a side street.[SEP]arguably, the noisiest room there was.[SEP]the rooms are nicely appointed, though the lack of a door between the sink area and the toilet / shower seemed a bit weird.[SEP]anyway, the bus noise was loud while it lasted, and quieted down about 10 pm.[SEP]traffic resumed about 7 am, so don't expect to sleep in here in the upstairs corner bungalow.[SEP]the breakfast area is small, nice and offers a fairly healthy choice of cold foods.[SEP]the decor and room appointments are first class.[SEP]i think i will drive furthur and stay at a quiter location -- or at least one that honors our request for a quiet room.
0	awful hotel![SEP]i should have paid attention to the reviews, but my travel agent said i would not have a problem with this hotel.[SEP]it was a dingy, dirty hotel.[SEP]terrible location.[SEP]the bathroom was so small that you could not use the toilet unless your feet were in the shower stall.[SEP]this hotel definitely has a sewer odor in the rooms at times and in the hallways.[SEP]there were stains on the ceiling and carpets, breakfast was terrible.[SEP]i could go on, but i iwll only say do not waste your money on this place.[SEP]it ruined our stay in florence.
0	we just returned from a stay in las vegas.[SEP]we stayed at the hilton grand vacation club in a 2 bedroom suite complete with kitchen and master bath.[SEP]the rooms were very nice but the location is at the far end of the old las vegas strip.[SEP]there was no security outside the hotel so you could not walk to nearby casinos, there were drunks out on the street and poor lighting and at least 2 blocks to next casino.[SEP]this is a huge hotel but it has no restaurants or gambling.[SEP]there were no transportation except cab to other hotels where you could get meals.[SEP]this hotel would be good for a family if only they has 2 bed rooms.[SEP]rooms are only available with one king bed so if you have kids too bad.[SEP]also they are doing construction next to the hotel that starts at 6 am.[SEP]i asked for a room facing away from construction
0	i was booked into this hotel as a member of a group.[SEP]i was able to go straight up to the room.[SEP]i found it to be comfortable, of a reasonable size, i was on my own in a twin bed room, clean and with reasonable amenities.[SEP]the bed was reasonably soft although i found the pillow a bit hard.[SEP]there is no bedside table but a sort of sideboard behind the bed.[SEP]the bathroom was of a decent size.[SEP]breakfast was more than adequate and i have to say that i have no complaints about the hotel itself.[SEP]however i would not stay there again for one big reason, location.[SEP]it is not very central, you have to go 3 stops on the rer from cdg etoile.[SEP]it is like being in a cattel truck.[SEP]the 10 minute journey leaves you wringing wet from the heat in the carriages.[SEP]when you get to the entrance hall of the metro at gare d lyon you may as well be in hampton court maize.[SEP]you need to look for sortie 6.alaas it disappears for a time, so yo have to be persistent.[SEP]you need to go up into themainline station and head for the main entrance.[SEP]come straight out and looking at you dead ahead is the hotel.[SEP]virtually all of my group managed to get lost on the first night at the hotel.[SEP]i came out at sortie 13 and it was unlucky for me as it took me 45 minutes to find the hotel!i always prefer a centrally located hotel, so although my stay was pleasant it is unlikely that i would stay here again.
0	hi i stayed at the holiday inn south boston for one night june29 i had a a stop over in logan airpp.[SEP]to and i booked on logan airport via courtesy phonecalls.[SEP]great the hotel is a bit far and the location is not so great besides the big highway.[SEP]but anyway its a great average holiday inn hotel the staff was helpful and they were nice its kind of worn and little bit run down but anyway ok.[SEP]ok for a night stay even a great hotel.[SEP]from.[SEP]fr johnnyb.
0	definitely not a 4 star hotel.[SEP]the hotel is very nice with lots of detail but the room accommodations are definitely not up to par.[SEP]they are small and not as you would expect for a 4 star hotel.[SEP]this location is so far from everything.[SEP]i guess it is great if you only plan to go the the animal kingdom which is great and you can pretend you are in a far away place.[SEP]but if you do want to do the rest of the attractions, you don't have to pretend, you really are in far away place considering the distance and traffic.[SEP]we always drive because those shuttle buses take for ever not a good thing when you have very tired, sleepy children (and parents).[SEP]the more i stay on disney site, the more i am dissappointed.[SEP][ at least this place was clean ].[SEP]i don't think i ask too much when they charge that much!
0	the rooms here are actually nice and clean.[SEP]the location in mission bay, however, is not great it was loud and not really that close to anything we like to do.[SEP]if you want to go to sea world it is ok.[SEP]to be sure, i can't stand the mission bay area of san diego and will never stay around that area ever again.[SEP]that is why i give this a two based upon location, location and location.[SEP]stay either in downtown or la jolla - not mission bay.
0	the room was of a high quality but feeling slightly dated and a bit bland and not up with the best in class.[SEP]in hong kong it would be being closed for an upgrade.[SEP]the bed was very comfortable and the room had everything that you would expect of a high qulaity business hotel.[SEP]we had one meal in the brasserie which was very good although due to lack of customers being a weekend it lacked atmosphere.[SEP]the restaurant staff were very good though.[SEP]the hotel is too far out if you are a tourist as its a tram or taxi ride into town and takes about 10 - 15 mins, though convenient for conference / exhibition centre.[SEP]the reception staff were poor - it took two attempts to get keys that worked and when asked about the airport shuttle they did not know when it ran.[SEP]two things that really annoyed me were the fact that they charged â£15 per person to use their pool even though we were staying there (that is the first time in 25 years odd of staying in top clas hotels that i have been charged) and their airport shuttle bus is not a shuttle but a private transfer which requires 2 hours notice and is more expensive than a taxi.[SEP]somewhere i read that they are trying to be the best hotel in amsterdam - i am afraid that whilst the food may be very good, the location is not great and charging for things that are normally free in any other top class hotel they do not make the grade.[SEP]there are much better places to stay in amsterdam for business and as a tourist.
0	the hotel is top notch.[SEP]the staff well presented and trained.[SEP]the room is plush, more tv channels available than most other hotels, the bed super comforable, a fridge if you'd like to store your own snacks and drinks and there are coffee / tea utensils in the room too.[SEP]wifi internet available for free with a code.[SEP](i forget if there was a computer in the lobby, not sure) unfortunately, the illusion of luxury is destroyed by its location because it becomes an odyssey to get to and fro the hotel.[SEP]the metro stop is on a line that requires you to change no matter where you want to go in paris.[SEP]the bus routes aren't that helpful either.[SEP]and there were vagrants outside which took the allure away from the place.[SEP]i got the room at a great price (some promo) and i would go again but i wouldn't take my friends there as they are not as enamored with paris as i am and i am pretty sure the negatives would put them off.
0	we stayed five nights during easter week.[SEP]check - in was fine, eduardo at the front desk was friendly & welcoming.[SEP]unfortunately, things went downhill from there.[SEP]our room was pretty much was we expected for a 2-bedroom suite, it appeared clean.[SEP]but, the room location was terrible.[SEP]we were in building a which overlooked busy international drive & we were subjected to a busy highway view & construction noise.[SEP]this facility is huge & offers many buildings far removed from the main entrance & the noise.[SEP]we booked our room well in advance.[SEP]so, there was no reason why we were given a room that should be reserved only if the hotel was fully booked.[SEP]housekeeping was non - existent.[SEP]not once did we return to our room to find anyone ever entered while we were gone.[SEP]we called every evening for replenishment of towels & removal of garbage.[SEP]the grounds were well kept, the coffee shop offered a small but adequate menu of breakfast & lunch.[SEP]the pool area was much too small & crowded, thanks to inconsiderate quests who grap every chair around them, whether they need them or not.[SEP]overall, i would not return to floridays and will stick to the marriott grande vista, a true resort.
0	nice property i stayed at the hotel for 1 night on business.[SEP]i picked the hotel on account of the novotel branding (which translates to me as meaning 3.5 - 4 star hotel / room / location / service) and the price.[SEP]true to the meaning, the hotel was good value - no fuss and efficient.[SEP]it was close enough to the centre to do business.[SEP]taxis were easy to get and commuting to the centre and or the nearest metro station was relatively inexpensive.[SEP]everything about the hotel from check - in / out to the room to the service was pleasant and efficient.[SEP]i was upgraded to a deluxe room with a view of the hillside.[SEP]the room was reasonable.[SEP]the drawbacks:1) there was no room service from late night.[SEP]feeling peckish, i had to go around to a noodle shop.2) there was no business centre 3) no free or lowcost wireless or broadband in the room
0	first off they trick you with pictures, so don't fall for it![SEP]the location isn't even near anything good.[SEP]before i begin with the horror know this, " cheap things aren't good and good things aren't cheap.[SEP]" we walk into the hotel which was a hike from everything, the staff were kinda shady, we get to our room and it's to s**t.[SEP]it was closet size.[SEP]bed bugs, of course.[SEP]i didn't want to walk around with no shoes on, bathrooms are shared, oh and if you mistakely go up to the last floor like i did, run, you may see a bat.[SEP]i almost fell through the floor.[SEP]i literally felt a pipe when i was walking in the hallway.[SEP]felt like a scam, the prices for that s**thole aren't low enough for the stay there.[SEP]what could of topped such a horrible stay you ask..[SEP]the sound of the guest next door boning.[SEP]thanks thin walls![SEP]don't do it to yourself.[SEP]i was so annoyed i put it on youtube, why i hate ny -samwow99
0	first of all i'm usually pretty good in picking great hotels with reasonable prices as well as location.[SEP]i read most of the reviews here on trip advisor and thought i'd give this hotel a shot since i'm an optomistic person and easy to please.[SEP]what the hell was i thinking!![SEP]i booked a jacuzzi room for a ridiculous price but thought oh, i'll get what i paid for, wrong![SEP]front screen window was damaged, door locks where chintzy, power strip hanging off the wall, string hanging from closet to turn light on, small tvs with no remote (jeez), peeling paint in restrooms, torn shower curtain, broken shower head, mold in restroom.[SEP]now for jacuzzi, broken knobs and drainage, had to use a sock to plug.[SEP]worst of all we attempted to relax in jacuzzi until rings of black substance came through!![SEP]please do not be a succer like me and stay here.[SEP]i'd would've been better off renting a motel6 in compton, calif.[SEP]left like a bat out of hell early in the morning to the best western lamplighter inn who graciously gave me a discount, better continental breakfast, clean room and wonderful staff!!
0	we stayed there for one night after a long 2 week road trip.[SEP]we had booked a king nonsmoking with fridge in tower 2.[SEP]after a hot walk from the parking lot (lots of construction) to the front desk it was another long dark hike thru the maze of the casino to our room.[SEP]no one at the desk asked if we needed assist with our bags.[SEP]when we got to our room was a 2 queen room on the far end of the 26th floor.[SEP]we had no fridge, no blow dryer (empty metal bracket on bathroom wall).[SEP]attempted to call front desk and got into a long phone queque listening to recordings about how to book a reservation.[SEP]tried to call bell hop again got same message.[SEP]finally hung up.[SEP]also, they require that you pay $1 a day for local phone service.[SEP]who uses hotel phones anymore with cell phones.[SEP]ate in the buffet twice nothing special.[SEP](had meal credits as part of our package).[SEP]we were constantly harrassed by high pressure sales to go to the hotel's timeshare presentation at every entrance.[SEP]we stayed at the tropicana just the previous week(same location on the strip) would probably stay there again.[SEP]the hotel has seen better days but the level of customer service was excellent.
0	we booked this hotel almost 1 year in advance.[SEP]we had stayed here 2 years before and had a great experience.[SEP]this time was a bit different.[SEP]the hotel is getting a bit run down.[SEP]we had requested port view rooms and only gave us two rooms with port view.[SEP]the other two rooms faced the mcdonalds in the back![SEP]the carpet is getting worn.[SEP]the tile in the bathtub was stained.[SEP]i am usually a big fan of this hotel because of location location location![SEP]but i probably won't stay again.[SEP]the restaurant was around $12 per person for breakfast.[SEP]so we walked to mcdonalds around the corner instead.[SEP]if you consider this hotel, i wouldn't stay more than one night.[SEP]the positives: directly across the street from bayside marketplace and close to port of miami.[SEP]if you have port view, you can see your ship in the morning.[SEP]perfect location for cruisers.[SEP]easy to get a taxi in the morning.[SEP]the negatives: the hotel is getting older.[SEP]many people paid less for the much nicer intercontinental a few doors down.[SEP]the staff wasn't too friendly or accomodating.[SEP]there is plenty of noise from the street below and the music at bayside marketplace.[SEP]housekeeping was lacking.[SEP]one of our rooms had a couch sofa bed, behind the couch was plaster (or something white and crumbly) from the walls all over the floor.[SEP]it was disgusting.
0	let's start on the positives: excellent breakfast clean sheets and towels general housekeeping beautiful polo lounge however, the location is much further from the centre than anticipated.[SEP]the walk back is uphill... not great when very hot.[SEP]the shuttle service is too regimented and only available at the hotels convenience.[SEP]drinks are very very expensive 10 euros for a cocktail and the bar arrangement is odd.[SEP]rooms are dated and need balcony furniture.[SEP]when we were there a business conference was taking place.[SEP]the management allowed the company concerned to take over all the leisure areas and to erect flip charts and notice boards in both lounge areas and reception.[SEP]on returning to the hotel after a long day we had to sit behind a hugh notice board in the corner of the room and at breakfast we had to walk through loads of people whilst their meeting was in session.[SEP]also we went down for breakfast within time only to find that the tables had been cleared but coffee and cakes were available for the business guests only.[SEP]noisy in the mornings from 6.00am.[SEP]fillipo the manager and the shuttle drivers were lovely.
0	stood one night here was perfect literally steps away from the beach![SEP]that's great right?[SEP]we certainly were pleased.[SEP]not a good location if u were looking to go to the boardwalk being that this motel is on 71 st and the boardwalk starts on 28th and goes to 1 st.[SEP]we rented scooters to get around quicker.[SEP]the service was good.[SEP]all in all it was great fun.
0	we like to stay at the marriott when we travel due to the high standard of service, comfortable rooms and the acceptance and treatment of young children.[SEP]we were disappointed by our stay here.[SEP]we had two rooms and while they were a good size there were no sumptous white beds.[SEP]the beds were uncomfortable and the pillows flat.[SEP]the airconditioner did not work on our last night and after several calls to the front dest no one came to fix the problem.[SEP]we found the service in the hotel to be very eratic.[SEP]the breakfast was almost unedible and the scrambled eggs tasted like custard.[SEP]we came to italy for the food!!![SEP]did not eat at the hotel after the poor standard of breakfast.[SEP]the location is (suposedly) prestigious but a long distance from the sights of the city, so next time we will stay somewhere more central and lively.[SEP]there is also no pool at this hotel (we knew this when we booked) and in retrospect we should have stayed at a hotel with a pool as at the end of a big day of walking, you really need a swim.[SEP]the fitness room was also very small and very limited.[SEP]the hotel is in need of an update and is starting to look scruffy and dark.[SEP]it was expensive to stay here and for the money we would not stay here again and i am sorry to say i would not stay here if we could use points either.[SEP]we are big fans of the marriott just not this hotel.
0	my wife and i stopped at the miramar mid - april as a stopover on the way back to the uk from borneo.[SEP]as a stopover hotel this establishment was adequate for our needs.[SEP]clean room, firm bed, good hot shower, tea and coffee in the room etc.[SEP]we had a premier room with a crazy coloured carpet (see pictures on the website).[SEP]i can't go into to much detail about this place as we weren't there very long but, the pool area is overlooked by two or three tall hotel blocks and didn't feel very inviting.[SEP]the hotel itself is clean and we were treated well by the staff.[SEP]there is a bar next to the lobby which has karaoke.[SEP]i went in briefly to look at the cocktails menu after a trip to the night safari (i will add a review for this soon).[SEP]i didn't stay in the bar long as the song that was being murdered was being sung at a volume that made my ears bleed.[SEP]i can't comment on the food either as we left at 6 am next morning and didn't sample the breakfast.[SEP]location wise, the hotel doesn't seem to be close to anything really.[SEP]we had a fifteen minute walk down to the world city shopping centre, and it isn't close to the mrt either.[SEP]overall, this hotel is good for a stopover but i would not use it as a base for a longer stay.
0	first off, be warned.[SEP]the outside of the hotel is ghastly.[SEP]even in the 1970s, this would've looked out of date.[SEP]you then get to reception, and one whole wall has been replaced with clear glass showing, errr, a car park.[SEP]it's as though there are cars waiting to check - in or something... but, for the $109 aus i paid for my double - room with a balcony, it's not bad from there on.[SEP]a large bed, a single bed next to it, tv & dvd player, good air - con, fridge, iron, large bathroom (walk - in shower).[SEP]the reception has a large selection of dvds for you to borrow (no charge).[SEP]and yes, there is quite a small but nice outdoor pool.[SEP]and the reception staff are really friendly.[SEP]full marks there.[SEP]all in all, it's not a bad hotel, as long as you close your eyes as you walk in..[SEP]but the location is truly terrible.[SEP]you're 30 minutes (2 miles) walk from central station, 2 miles walk from darling harbour.[SEP]there are bars and shops near the hotel, but very little else.[SEP]personally, i would opt for a hotel in a better location - there are plenty of quiet, similarly - priced hotels closer to central station, and all will then allow you to walk to darling harbour, the shopping precincts, and so on.[SEP]having to get buses & taxis to get to civilization did nothing for me!
0	the first night was a disaster, we arrived at midnights and plan to sleep late, however at 5 o’clock a lot of noise was coming from m the metro and the reception.[SEP]after we relocated to an upper floor, the impression was much better- the rooms are clean but very small.[SEP]breakfast was nice but minimalist.[SEP]the service and atmosphere were very nice.[SEP]the location, a bit far a way from the main attraction of paris.[SEP]still, it might me that for around 100 euro per night in paris – the expectation from the hotel level need to be realistic and we ca n’t expect facilities as in other towns in the same price.
0	this was quite possibly the worst stay i have ever experienced and i've stayed in some crap hotels that had a friendly and more knowledgeable staff than this joke of a hotel, not only was our room not ready when we arrived at 6 pm, i was treated rudely by the front desk clerk and then he dismissed me to help someone else who got into their room right away.[SEP]for $509.00 (tax included) a night i expected better service.[SEP]when my room was ready my room key was tossed on the counter and we weren't even told how to get to it which tower or anything.[SEP]we then called for a vending machine location were sent on a wild goose chase, never did find it.[SEP]we called the concierge for a taxi and were told they had them on call and one would be, well we ended up driving our own vehicle, no taxis were available.[SEP]the laziness of this staff was astonishing![SEP]no one at this hotel seemed to be friendly, willing to help or even apologize for their lack of quality service.[SEP]i will never return to this hotel until changes in staff manners & knowledge of the facility are finally a part of this hotel.
0	first and last stay at the etap i selected the etap hotel because of price since berlin is expensive.[SEP]this hotel has no lift, so i had to get a room on the ground floor asi am disabled, although ambulatory.[SEP]the room was very small even for one person, although it had enough beds for 3 people.[SEP]the lighting was so poor i had to go around the corner to the building materials store to buy a stick light in order to have enough light to clean andapply my contact lenses.[SEP]the toilet and shower was modular, but the toilet was separate from the shower.[SEP]the shower head was mounted in the ceiling and could not be adjusted.[SEP]the bed was extremely hard anduncomfortable.[SEP]the location was so far out that there were no restaurants in the area and i had to drive back into the city to finda restaurant.[SEP]the best thing about this hotel was that it is clean, cheap and the management is friendly, helpful and speaks good english.[SEP]i will never again stay at another etap hotel and would advise others to avoid it if you want even a minimum of comfort.
0	my husband and i stayed at kahana falls last week.[SEP]we were very disappointed with this place.[SEP]we had what was supposed to be a one bedroom, 2 bath unit.[SEP]it ended up to be a studio and lock out room combined.[SEP]the furnishings were very old and dated and the set up of the 2 rooms together was very weird.[SEP]our lanai overlooked a small parking lot where the employees and service workers came and went.[SEP]we never used it because of that.[SEP]who wants to look at garbage coming and going and supplies being delivered?[SEP]we actually called rci to see if we could be moved somewhere else.[SEP]this place needs some serious updating just to become average.[SEP]the best things about this resort is they have air conditioning, a computer for guests to use and a mid week cleaning service.[SEP]the location was not good and i would never recommend this place to anyone.
0	first, the pros.... the hotel is very modern and nicely furnished.[SEP]rooms, beds comfortable.[SEP]bathrooms are marble with rainhead shower.[SEP]the cons.....[SEP]we didn't care for the location.[SEP]it was too busy.[SEP]we prefer the 50s on the east side because it is quiter, more residential and still in walking distance to the theatre.[SEP]the biggest con was that there is a club on the second floor of the hotel and we heard the music from midnight until 3 am up on the 10th floor.[SEP]when you stay in the city for one night so that you don't have to drive home after a broadway play, you want to go to sleep before 3 am.[SEP]we should have just driven home.[SEP]very disappointed in our experience at this " luxury " kimpton hotel.[SEP]luxuryhotel and club music just don't go together.[SEP]kimpton should figure out which market it wants... the people who want to go clubbing or the people willing to drop $400-$500 per night on a room.
0	i did a lot of research before our trip to new orleans and wanted to stay in the best luxury hotel there.[SEP]i chose the roosevelt because of the great reviews and waldorf name.[SEP]i was very happy with the hotel.[SEP]we received a free upgrade upon checkin and our suite was enormous.[SEP]we had a living room, powder room, dining room, bedroom and huge bathroom.[SEP]my only complaint was the location.[SEP]if you want to walk right out into the quarter this hotel is a bit off the beaten path.[SEP]next time i will choose a hotel where i can walk right out and be at the bars and restaurants.[SEP]that being said.[SEP]the roosevelt was very quiet and far enough away from the hussle and bussle that it made for a relaxing stay if that's what you're after.[SEP]i just didn't like the long walk into the quarter, it made me feel like once i was out i had to stay out.[SEP]and i didn't want to walk that far home late at night.
0	be very careful before booking use extreme caution before booking here.[SEP]when i made my reservation by phone, i specifically asked for a quiet room.[SEP]what i got is what i feared would happen: a room on the first level near market street.[SEP]the conversations of people on the streets, traffic, streetcars, others slamming iron gates to the 2nd and third floors was a shattering noisy nightmare.[SEP]the room stank, had no air, and it was difficult to breath.[SEP]tthe shower was something you would not want to use.[SEP]i tryed to rest in the room after arrving early afternoon and it was impossible.[SEP]after dinner, i returned to the room and decided it was not the kind of place i wanted to spend the night.[SEP]when i announced at the office i would be leaving because the room was noisy, stank, and i couldn't breath, i asked for an adjustment or partial refund, the manager was called by phone (not on location) and my request was denied.[SEP]it was a blessing in disguise.[SEP]it was well worth the cost to leave this establishment- never to return.
0	at 75 euro per night online ($118), i can't really complain.[SEP]but this hotel is not more than ok.[SEP]there is never more than one person behind the desk, even at peak times, so if you need something it could be a wait.[SEP]staff is responsive and helpful but multi tasking is not their strong suit.[SEP]air conditioning (record heat, 101 + one day) was weak (top floor corner room) and conked out twice in six nights, including the last night, so no sleep before departure.[SEP]10 minute walk to termini but location is right smack in the middle of embassy cluster, so armed guards are every where and there are relatively few places to eat in the immediate square block (embassies generally have their own kitchen facilities, so staff does not pour into the street for lunch).[SEP]complimentary breakfast below standard for 4 star europe hotels, but adequate.[SEP]hotel restaurant was nothing special and overpriced (but no more than virtually all italian tourist hotels).[SEP]would recommend only at bargain or 2 1/2 - 3 star rates.
0	i stayed at the super 8 with my boyfriend as we were doing a road trip up the west coast, we are very much budget travelers and the motel 8 sounded like a great location.[SEP]that could not have been further from the truth.[SEP]for the 15 minutes i sat in the car waiting for him to check in i saw 2 hookers and lots and lots of homeless people.[SEP]it is definitley not a nice area to be in, i being a female would have been scared to walk around even in the daytime if my boyfriend had not been there, and wouldn't even think about venturing out at night.[SEP]the room itself was ok, big bed, tv with lots of channels.[SEP]the front desk staff were fairly friendly but were not very informed about things such as the " high speed internet in every room.[SEP]" as computer literate people we went downstairs to see about a password, no password and no help offered either only the computer downstairs which charged $10 for 10 minutes and the in the lobby which smells like indian food.[SEP]you get what you pay for as far as budget hotels, however, we paid $65, not a lot of money, and were ripped off.
0	this hotel is not a good choice for anyone who is visiting paris as a tourist.[SEP]considering the price, the guest rooms are incredibly noisy and the beds are not overly comfortable.[SEP]the location is also somewhat inconvenient as a base for sightseeing and the immediate neighborhood is devoid of shops and restaurants.[SEP]if you aren't strictly a jaded business traveler, this hotel is a waste of perfectly good money.[SEP]there are too many other non - corporate, less expensive, more comfortable hotels to choose from in paris.
0	i stayed for 5 nights at the very beginning of april for business as i was working nearby and could not get in to the hotel across the road.[SEP]good points: - friendly, attentive staff.[SEP]- nicely appointed rooms.[SEP]- decent selection of tv channels.[SEP]- close to restaurants / supermarket.[SEP]- decent wireless internet access.[SEP]bad points: - poor selection of hot food at breakfast.[SEP]- incredibly loud toilets, gives the impression the walls are paper thin![SEP]much louder than the toilets on the airplane that i arrived on![SEP]- when you ask for a quiet room, you usually expect a quiet room.[SEP]you expect plane noise..[SEP]but jet ski's going up and down the river behind the hotel, and no double - glazing / sound insulation whatsoever... which... for a hotel virtually on top of an airport..[SEP]is a bit amazing.[SEP]i've stayed in the sofitel across the road and not had these issues previously.[SEP]if you put this hotel anywhere else, away from the location it is in... then it would be absolutely amazing value and would not hesitate to recommend it.[SEP]but the noise issues mean i wouldn't dream of doing so.[SEP]if i could give sleep quality a zero rating, i would've done so.
0	water scalding to ice in 2.0 seconds flat not the worst place we've stayed.[SEP]enough issues that we'd look elsewhere the next time we visit beijing.[SEP]the shower water was the most remarkable- from scalding hot to ice cold for the entire shower- and it stopped flowing not one, not two, but three times for my wife's shower- weird.[SEP]the breakfast is fine, the security is good (key to operate elevator) and the staff seems fine.[SEP]this is the only hotel in china i've stayed in that had service staff with a western attitude (complaining to coworkers and frowning).[SEP]finally, we do not like the location, in the midst of the most expensive everything![SEP]we'll choose a place like the bamboo garden hotel again if they have space.
0	i booked this hotel after it's rave reviews on trip advisor.[SEP]while it is a very nice hotel and the rooms are lovely i felt it overpriced compared to other hotels we stayed in while in the states.[SEP]the staff were very friendly and the rooms were comfortable i didn't feel the location was the best.[SEP]it is very close to fishermans wharf which was a let down.[SEP]very dirty and a lot of beggars and homeless people.[SEP]next time i will stay up around union square which is more close to the action and better restaurants.
0	as i read the reviews i wonder what do people need to be comfortable and satisfied?[SEP]i stayed in good night in for 8 nights in april - may 2008.[SEP]i was pleasantly surprised![SEP]even tho the sink was outside the bathroom and our first rooms ac broke down, it was still a pleasant and nice stay.[SEP]bed was comfortable, shower was nice and about everything worked.[SEP]the staff was nice and helpful.[SEP]we stayed on the freeway side at first and that was noisy, but after our ac broke down we switched rooms to one next to the pool and there was no noise at all.[SEP]i enjoyed my stay very much.[SEP]only bad thing about good night inn is it's location.
0	let me preface this by saying i paid $150 for three nights.[SEP]i have stayed in more expensive hostels.[SEP]positive: super cheap if your lucky, location isn't horrible as long as your willing to walk 15 minutes to the sites, breakfast (cafe) is complimentary, close to osteria angelina, and rooms are quaint.[SEP]negative: breakfast is served in a dungeon, our room smelled like a portable toilet at a music festival, and if you plan on spending time in the room off of the bed i hope you don't need to bring asuitcase as one renders this impossible.[SEP]all these would be manageable given the price (i would have planned on returning to the hotel) if not for the belligerent man who works behind the desk.[SEP]when i first arrived he harassed me regarding not smoking in the room... i do not smoke.[SEP]after accidentally spilling on my bed i was condesceningly reprimanded.[SEP]the icing on the cake was when upon checking my bag i was told that " if i cared about what was in my bag i should carry it with me ".[SEP]the other employees were fantastic but the grumpy old man all but ruined our experience.
0	please do not book this hotel for your stay in nyc![SEP]the location is a nightmare if you are driving.[SEP]it's surrounded by ground zero which kind - a creeped me out.[SEP]the moment we entered in this hotel it gave me negative wibe.[SEP]the staff was friendly and helpful but the hotel was not at all what i expected it to be.[SEP]the room was tiny and the bed was uncomfortable.[SEP]the bathroom was clean but very small and the toiletteries provided were disgusting![SEP]we actually cit our trip short here and moved to a hotel at times' sqaure to get some peace of mind and feel happy about our stay in nyc.[SEP]i will never go back to this hotel and to this specific location.
0	stayed at this hotel because it was close to my friend's place.[SEP]the location was not that convenient if you didn't drive.[SEP]it takes about an hour to go downtown (bus + subway).[SEP]too bad that they don't offer shuttle from airport.[SEP]you have to get a taxi to go there, which is insanely expensive![SEP]i called before my arrival to ask about the best way to travel from the airport to the hotel, i hated it when they say " you have to get a cab.[SEP]" they still charge for internet - $10 a day, but i think you get the first two hours for free?[SEP]i only used internet for once and the package i got was only 2 hours and i didn't get charged for that.[SEP]the lobby was fabulous, the room was a bit outdated tho.[SEP]staff members were helpful
0	we stayed here for a few nights as a stop over on the way back from london.[SEP]the service was average, but the rooms were great, big and clean![SEP]the location was ok, there were some weird people around so i wouldn't feel safe going on the subway at night![SEP]the subway was clean, cheap and quick and would recommend using this to get around![SEP]the breakfasts were amazing![SEP]with big waffels!![SEP]would be a great place to stay if you hired a car as you can't walk anywhere and the buses weren't that great as they were very full![SEP]overall we enjoyed our stay here!
0	the staff were very friendly and efficient.[SEP]the facilities in the room are very modern and work very well.[SEP]the room was spacious, has a nice balance between classic and modern and the bed was hard to get out of.[SEP]elegant bathroom.[SEP]the buffet breakfast was also excellent, lots of variety with cold meat, eggs, bread, cookies and fruit salads.[SEP]the poorest point is the location: not near the centre of berlin, in the boring south section of the city.[SEP]it's also very far from the tegel airport (a taxi costs around € 60 and takes between 45 and 55 minutes).[SEP]fortunately, there is a variety of restaurants and bars within the hotel itself and this compensates a little for the isolated location of this place.
0	the breakfast was great and the room was oversized and clean but the location of this hotel is less than ideal.[SEP]there is no shuttle to the strip they just tell you to head down the block to catch the monorail but the neightborhood is very scary and i wouldn't walk it at night.[SEP]my vechile actually got broken into and the hotel didn't even care even though it was in their parking lot and under a light.[SEP]they actually made me feel like it was my fault and have signs posted saying park at your own risk.[SEP]what is that?[SEP]where else do i park?[SEP]they obviously have a problem but won't do anythig about it.[SEP]now i'm stuck with a $350 bill to fix my car.[SEP]thank you embassy suites.[SEP]do not recommend this hotel.
0	i must say that we found a very inexpensive price for this hotel at the last minute but, unfortunately, as was the case here, you really get what you pay for.[SEP]this property has so much potential as it really is quite nice.[SEP]" beach " is terrible though.[SEP]from the excruciatingly slow check - in process to the loud dj and plastic cups at the interior bar, things really start to fall apart.[SEP]it certainly didn't help that the room had an overwhelming mold / musty smell.[SEP]no matter how long you left the balcony door open, the smell would not dissipate.[SEP]one of the most pathetic and down - market requirements is that you wear a plastic bracelet denoting your guest status.[SEP]are you serious?[SEP]this practice must be done away with.[SEP]we only ate on - site one night which was at the pasion restaurant and the food was quite good.[SEP]every other night (we were only there three nights) food was had elsewhere.[SEP]location is not good -- you really need to drive to find decent eateries (there's nothing on route 3) unless you want to hit the kiosks in luquillo repeatedly which i can see can get quite old quite soon.[SEP]again, we didn't pay much for this place nor would i.[SEP]i very strongly recommend seeking accomodation elsewhere until they can get their act together here.[SEP]the only upside i can report is the nice weather -- good to get away from snow and freezing cold and enjoy 85 degree warmth.
0	the only thing missing from this hotel was the " e " in the name.... overall quite poor.[SEP]location is terrible with a 30 minute bus run into the city centre.[SEP]the bedroom we stayed in was very poor and very unlike the web site.....[SEP]in fact the rooms were nothinglike the web site so i actually wonder if the pitcures were taken in the hotel at all!.[SEP]the beds were very uncomfortable and the duvet was the size for a single bed.... no hot water on the first day at all so 2 cold showers![SEP]the breakfast buffet again was poor and more could have been done with little imagination.[SEP]staff were reasonably helpful however i got the feeling they were oblivious to the standards they were working in.[SEP]i am sure once checked in many more people will share the same dissapointment.[SEP]overall poor and i would not recomend visiting this hotel.
0	i had wanted to stay at mandalay bay since my last trip to vegas (a really long time ago!) so when we booked a trip through southwest airlines jackpot vacations i jumped on it.[SEP]the hotel was everything i remembered it to be and i wasn't even a little dissapointed.[SEP]the issue was the location of the hotel in relation to the strip.[SEP]there is a free tram from mandalay bay to the excalibur, but it hardly makes a difference.[SEP]the walking, even in comfortable shoes and being in really good shape, was just too much.[SEP]we made it down to ceasars palace and almost collapsed.[SEP]there is no point in trying to take taxi's, as the traffic on the strip is always rediculous.[SEP]so if you stay here, be prepared and have a plan.
0	the blue is a lovely hotel with nice rooms, but the location leaves much to be desired.[SEP]it seems they are trying to develop the area around it into a hip nightspot, but right now it is dead during the day and weeknights, and loud on weekends until the wee hours.[SEP]if you are traveling high end and willing to pay for taxis to go everywhere, teh location is not as difficult, but for those using sydney's great and economical public transport, this hotel is not convenient to train, bus or ferry transport.[SEP]busses only come once every 40 - 60 minutes, which means alot of waiting.[SEP]it is also surrounded by a fairly empty area at night, with homeless people sleeping under bridges just a few streets away.[SEP]although sydney is a pretty safe city no matter where you go, this is one of the more questionable sections if you are walking alone at night.[SEP]for the same price, you are much better off staying somewhere in the city center, the rocks or darling harbour - or down at the beaches like bondi.
0	this was our first stay at a hampton inn - and we enjoyed it very much..[SEP]its nice to have the staff look at you and smile when you meet them in the hallway.[SEP]the breakfast was pretty good - and the room was clean and comfortable.[SEP]i'm not sold on the location - its fairly close the space needle - but not " downtown " as the description says - its also tricky to find and get into because of the one way streets and seattle's general lack of signage.[SEP]there are many thai restaurants around there and we really enjoyed a meal at tup tim thai - which is a short drive away - excellent food.
0	we had booked a studio at this apartment hotel and got a one bedroom suite.[SEP]it was very roomy, clean and comftorable.[SEP]there is alot of construction going on outside but that did not really bother us.[SEP]it is probably as far north as you want to go but we did feel safe.[SEP]there is an all night pizza place and a little grocery right across the street.[SEP]it is just a short walk to lexington where there are at least a million restaurants![SEP]you are close to bus and subway stops.[SEP]on the subway you are not more than 15 minutes to most places including times square and the theatre district.[SEP]otherwise you can walk to central park, alot ol the museums, restaurants and some shopping.[SEP]the staff was very nice.[SEP]all that said we will look for another location.[SEP]it is a little out of the way and as i said earlier the location is not the best but, if you are looking for alot of room in a clean space this is great.
0	the location of the hotel was not convenient.[SEP]it was 7 or 8 blocks away from the nearest metro station.[SEP]the wifi in the hotel was more like a wireless dialup connection.[SEP]i was rarely able to stay connected for more than 5 minutes.[SEP]3 different front desk receptionists gave me 3 different pieces of information when i tried to schedule transportation from the hotel to the airport.[SEP]they told me 3 different prices: 30euros, 50euros, and 25euros.[SEP]also, i scheduled pickup with the evening person for 9 am the next morning and saw her write it down on their calendar.[SEP]when i tried to confirm the pickup the next morning, another lady told me i would have to go outside to hail a taxi because there were no taxis available.[SEP]she then tried to explain, rudely, that it is hard to reserve a taxi for 5 ppl and that the supply is limited in barcelona.[SEP]ok, but why was nt this explained to me by the other 2 women i spoke to?[SEP]i would not recommend this hotel because of bad service and inconvenient location.
0	unfortunately there was nothing else in the city available under $400/nt for my dates.[SEP]first impressions: the exterior is dismal and crumbling, and it only gets worse from there.[SEP]the interior overwhelms you with the smells of mold and mildew, likely coming from the ancient faded carpet and walls.[SEP]i spent three unfortunate nights here, and the moldy / mildewy atmosphere has left me with a bad case of bronchitis and laryngitis.[SEP]the covers on the bed were so old and stained and disgusting, i held it with 2 fingers, and pulled it to the floor, forcing myself to sleep in a cold room without covers, lest i would catch something worse and more contagious than a cold.[SEP]as for the location, it claims to be center city, but it really on the fringe.[SEP]there is no reasonably close public transit, so be prepared to take cabs everywhere.[SEP]conclusion: everything is in disrepair and very rundown.[SEP]it is time they just take a bulldozer to the place.[SEP]i will never stay here again.[SEP]it is not just aesthetic, but for health that i warn against the " best " western center city philadelphia.
0	this is a really nice hotel.[SEP]it provides everything you would expect from a hotel in this class, and it is a great deal at the weekend when the financial district is quiet.[SEP]excellent beds, helpful staff - no problems at all.[SEP]century 21, a truly wonderful department store - discount but not tacky - is right next door.[SEP]however - it is not in midtown or anywhere near it if you like to walk.[SEP]we did not find the subway as convenient as it might have been: some stations are closed because of ground zero rebuilding and on the long weekend we were there, ticket machines wouldn't take any notes, only coins.[SEP]having just arrived, we didn't have many coins - so take some![SEP]buses don't take notes either.[SEP]you could buy a pass with a credit card, but obviously you need to be travelling a fair bit to make it worth it.[SEP]none of this is the millenium's fault - but be aware and come prepared.[SEP]one other problem with the location is that there are very few restaurants within walking distance.[SEP]it's a very nice hotel, but be prepared to use public transport a lot.[SEP]previously we had stayed in midtown and were certainly spoilt for choice with restaurants close by, but of course, you pay more.[SEP]for the money - we paid about $400 australian per night - it's great.
0	my wife and i stayed here for two reasons... a) the pool b) the price we were not disappointed.[SEP]the service was amazing as we were upgraded to a pool view room.[SEP]the pool itslef was huge but the with the coverage of palm trees the pool seemed like a beautiful quite, secluded oasis![SEP]the tikie bar was nice too.[SEP]our room was very cleand and was quite obvious it has been recently renovated.[SEP]we loved the way it was done up and was very comfortable.[SEP]the only two drawbacks are the location.... so if you want to party on duval you better plan on a 5 - 10 minute cab ride or have a dd.[SEP]luckily my wife was nt drinking so she drove.[SEP]the other thing was luckily we did nt notice until the morning of our last day, but the duvet is only covered by two ned sheets on either side is obviously not washed all the time as my wife did notice quite a few stains... but no biggy.[SEP]i do nt know why anyone would spend double the price to stay, this was great and would def.[SEP]stay here again!
0	the worst hotel in south beach clearly, this was the worst hotel in south beach.[SEP]you can easily find a different hotel at the same price so don't bother with san juan.[SEP]awful smell, dirty carpets, plastic chairs in front of the hotel, and not so great location.[SEP]yes, it is right across from delano but it just makes it worse.[SEP]after all, it is like a few good blocks from ocean dr.[SEP]there was some kind of stove in our room but it was covered with aluminium foil and we didn't dare to use it.[SEP]however, we appreciated the fact that there was refrigator.[SEP]the swimming pool is dangerous, there are living species so do not disturb them.[SEP]the whole place is falling apart, starting from the lobby to the broken bathroom door in our room.[SEP]i went to south beach in december 2008 and the hotel looked even worse.[SEP]no, i didn't stay at san juan but wanted to look at this place and that assured me that this is the worst hotel in the area.
0	inn at key west was fine.[SEP]not great.[SEP]not bad.[SEP]not special.[SEP]not terrible.[SEP]just fine.[SEP]the front desk was a little rude and the concierge was short.[SEP]the location was a bit too far from the hustle and bustle of key west.[SEP]it was about a 35 minute bike ride or a $15 cab fare.[SEP]i will say that the pool was great (though i think it should stay open later than 10).[SEP]the rooms were clean (though our mini - fridge didn't work).
0	the hotel is modern, clean and offers many of the amenities found in a five star resort at a tremendous rate.[SEP]they have a stunning patio, we sat in the patio alone in the evening paying $12 for a glass of wine.[SEP]it falls short in a poor location outside the city center(santi marti area on some maps).[SEP]the rooms are unique but small.[SEP]phone services are contracted out and a local call is the same rate as an international one.[SEP]rates can vary from 170 - 200 + euros/ night.[SEP]there are much better finds out there closer to the city center.[SEP]if you go, ask for a room away from the daily construction.
0	this hotel is awful![SEP]stayed one night as we were in barcelona overnight to make a connection, and this property is listed as 4 stars.[SEP]the free shuttle van took over 30 minutes to pick us up, then the driver unloaded our luggage on the hotel driveway and walked away.[SEP]the front desk person told us there was no staff to help with our luggage.[SEP]room was tiny, never had hot water (only warm) and the door to our room was so thin all sounds from other rooms and the corridor were heard, in fact if someone knocked on any door near our room we thought it was our room.[SEP]this hotel is seriously over - rated and best western should be ashamed to recommend this hotel or to advertise as a 4-star hotel.[SEP]finally: location![SEP]this property is a 15 minute drive to the airport in a simply awful part of barcelona in an industrial area.
0	nice clean hotel, but the location is lacking.[SEP]too close to the hwy and too far removed from everything.[SEP]david, the concierge, is rude and not helpful.[SEP]i called him to get suggestions for dinner and he barked at me and said he was very busy.[SEP]sorry for bothering you.[SEP]if you don't like your job you should go work somewhere else.
0	stayed here after for three nights and was glad to leave.[SEP]the rooms are tired and in need of a revamp - chipped furniture, dirty small patio area outside the room which i would not have sat in, and non working light bulbs not replaced during stay.[SEP]had room service one night, (terrible soggy pizza) and the tray sat outside my room for two days.[SEP]this was after placing an order only to be told we had the old room service menu and having to make a further two phone calls to get an updated version.[SEP]no do not disturb signs in this place for some reason, so the maids constantly trying to look round the curtains into the rooms in the morning.[SEP]cleaning outside the rooms starts very early and noisily at 7am- just what you want ona vacation i liked the waterside restaurant, nice location especially in the evening, very friendly staff here.[SEP]did nt try the more expensive option.[SEP]staff seemed to be constantly moving round on golf carts- doing what i do not know.[SEP]no pool side service- why?[SEP]probably acceptable if you have kids, get a good deal and are going to sea world, which you can walk to- otherwise there is little reason to stay here.
0	i was very disappointed at the quality of this hotel given how much it cost us (even at a reduced rate through laterooms.com).[SEP]although the reception gave the impression of a four star modern hotel the rooms were more like 1 or 2 star.[SEP]the rooms were very small and dingy with horrible stains on the walls.[SEP]bathroom was tiny and didn't look particularly clean.[SEP]i'm sure you can find a lot better hotels for the same money and in a more convenient location.[SEP]this hotel is quite isolated so wouldn't recommend if you are looking to go out in central london.
0	reasonable value the room was large, well appointed and upgraded with a nice tv, bed and ammenities.[SEP]the bathroom hasn't been upgraded and is one of the older style with the removable shower head.[SEP]the location is more kings cross and all that has to offer than potts point but i never had any trouble in kings cross as long as you keep your eyes on the road and walk fast.[SEP]the rooms have nice views.[SEP]the room i had was connected to another room by door so you could hear the occupants talk sneeze, laugh and other things quite clearly.[SEP]i got used to it but it could keep you up at night if they were noisy, fortunately, my neighbours were quiet.[SEP]the room was quite good value despite this though the noise factor could be unbearable depending on the neighbours.[SEP]i think the staff were efficient.[SEP]the rooms were cleaned well though i found a stack of dirty sheets on the floor left in my room.[SEP]having internet costs $12 per hour.[SEP]quite a fair place to stay for the price depending on what room you get.
0	we stayed in a great place in cape coral prior to arriving here so this was a bit of a let down.[SEP]it's okay, not great.[SEP]i've stayed in better places in orlando for the price.[SEP]the location is a bit of a pain to get to.[SEP]check in was fast, check out not so much.[SEP]my husband was arguing with the front desk about a bar charge until they realized they had the wrong room.[SEP]note in the room telling you how much the towels, coffee maker etc.[SEP]will cost should you take them.[SEP]that's tacky and made me wonder about the type of clientele they have.[SEP]on the upside, the pool area is fun for kids and the room was quiet.
0	when we arrived, they advised us there was a couple with a sick baby in our room that could not depart and we would be moved for the night to their sister hotel, hotel bolivar, a four - star.[SEP]the room at the bolivar was disgusting (see seperate review).[SEP]i called the borromeo the next morning to complain about the conditions and hoped their accomodations would be better.[SEP]they assured me it would be but as i expected, they were not![SEP]the room they gave us was a suite that most likely had not been renovated since 1960.[SEP]there were exposed electrical wires at the top of the shower and the shower head was caked with mildew.[SEP]there was a hole in the bathroom door, as though someone rammed it with a broomstick.[SEP]the noise from the street polluted our room (we had no shutters) and the room shook every time a metro went by!!![SEP]i asked if they had better accomodations available and they put us in another room on the third floor, which seemed a bit better, but after seeing the roaches i was absolutely repulsed![SEP]this really put a damper on our stay in rome.[SEP]the location wasn't so great either.[SEP]do not stay here
0	clean (the room and bathroom were cleaned every day.[SEP]they gave us more towels than we needed and changed them every day), friendly staff, the room was just what you need (with a good but a bit noisy ac, and a tv with a good choice of channels), the bell captain / luggage service was perfect.[SEP]nothing was decieving or annoying, except the fact that it has no restaurant.[SEP]but the hotel is located in a area where u can find everything (grocery shops, restaurants, coffee shops, pharmacy, dry cleaning service, etc etc).[SEP]the location is good (u can find anything you need) but a bit far from downtown manhattan.[SEP]i was positively surprised with this hotel.
0	got stuck at this hotel because on our way back from amsterdam, we didn't get in montreal in time to connect to our flight for toronto.[SEP]this is pretty basic stuff.[SEP]it's a motel more than a hotel.[SEP]at least, it look that way in the section that we were.[SEP]the room was ok, but it could have been more clean.[SEP]the location is probably good if you've got a car or if you're counting on the airport shuttle, but there's nothing interesting close to the hotel.[SEP]we ordered food in the room.[SEP]very expansive for what we got.[SEP]and because our baggage were lost in transit, we had to buy a toothbrush, a comb and a few things like that.[SEP]they charged us an exhorbitant price for cheap stuff that you could probably get at 5 for a buck at a dollar store.[SEP]i was really not impressed with that.
0	horrible, horrible room.[SEP]totally run down.[SEP]disgusting carpets, old paintwork.[SEP]even the enamel in the bath was worn off.[SEP]very expensive for what it was.[SEP]extremely noisy - can hear the busy road, sirens all night long.[SEP]hated the location too.[SEP]please don't stay at this hotel.[SEP]you will just regret it.
0	this hotel sits on top of some really great restaurants, and has a fantastic location, yet it just misses the boat.[SEP]our room was a double queen suite, the t.v. was ancient and got terrible reception.[SEP]the rug did not meet the door, the handles were broken off of the kitchen cabinetry, the bathroom was miniscule, wallpaper peeling off the walls, get the picture?[SEP]it just reminded us of a sleazy no tell motel, that has not been updated since the early 70's.[SEP]there is no conceirge, and the front desk people seem to know nothing about the city, why??[SEP]we ate at both the saloon restaurant and the 200 east, both fantastic.[SEP]we ordered room service from the saloon and it arrived hot and within 15 minutes, awesome![SEP]they let us know they were not affiliated with the hotel, too bad.[SEP]maybe if who was running these restaurants was running the hotel it would be a great destination.[SEP]even with a great rate through travelzoo, we will not return.
0	worse than terrible![SEP]do not stay here![SEP]we were a family of 8 traveling together and spending a full week at this hotel.[SEP]we reserved 4 rooms.[SEP]upon arrival only 3 available rooms.[SEP]they refused to work with us or speak to travel agent.[SEP]even worse the air conditioning in the hotel did not work and the staff refused to provide fan's in any of the 3 rooms.[SEP]even after the air conditioning was fixed it still did not work in our room and the staff pretty much called us liar's before they would send someone up to look at the unit.[SEP]the staff was not helpful and quite rude the entire time.[SEP]wait that is not the worst of it.[SEP]upon our return we noticed they charged us $1500 too much.[SEP]the way the work the books![SEP]it is 4 months later and to date we have only been refunded $200 of the $1500 over charge.[SEP]i am still working with my bank to get the remainder of the money.[SEP]the staff is rude and not helpful.[SEP]i would never recommend this hotel.[SEP]even though the location is good it is not worth 2 times what they claim they charge.[SEP]watch your credit card charges or better yet if you insist on staying there pay cash and don't give them a card.[SEP]otherwise you may be sorry!![SEP]i can not recommend this hotel under any circumstances.[SEP]do not stay at the albergo firenze florence it is the worst hotel experience i have ever had.
0	this hotel experience was very pleasant.[SEP]very friendly staff.[SEP]the hotel was modern, very clean and tidy and the facilities were excellent.[SEP]the room had a nice view of the river.[SEP]there was a good sized pool, a great gym, sun lounges, a spa pool, and steam rooms.[SEP]the hotels restaurant wasn't that great but there was a bridge right outside the jade lounge door which took you across the river, where there were plenty of bars, restaurants, and cafes.[SEP]the hotel itself isn't in the greatest location as there are no malls nearby and no activities in walking distance.[SEP]would definitely recommend, and would stay here again.
0	firstly, i really liked this hotel.[SEP]but reviewing this property is difficult because the property is good but the location and difficulty getting in and out of the place seriously affects your stay.[SEP]i performed a couple of the hardest u turns known to man just exiting and entering the hotel.[SEP]its proximity to the freeway is great but sometimes being right on the exit makes it impossible to avoid unbelievable amounts of traffic.[SEP]seriously, if you think i am overdoing it on the traffic thing you should google earth the location and look for yourself.[SEP]the price was good, the service was nice, breakfast was cheap and the shuttle would have worked if i was there for the theme parks.[SEP]please pick up and relocate and i will rate you a 5.
0	the hotel's location is rather seedy and not at all inviting, but beyond that the hotel itself was excellent.[SEP]the rooms were very comfortable and contained everything you may need, including plush pillows and duvet for a good nights sleep, safety deposit box, microwave, fridge, tea / coffee making facilities, television and clock radio, telephone, haridryer and even an umbrella![SEP]the staff were very friendly and helpful especially in the white spot restaurant situated next door, which offered excellent food at affordable prices.[SEP]the hotel offered an internet connection service in the lobby and provided a free shuttlebus service during working hours, dropping you at any location within the downtown vancouver area.[SEP]there was also a 7 - 11 grocery store just opposite the hotel - open 24 hours which offered a good selection of groceries.[SEP]vancouver itself is a lovely city, we would highly recommend you visit stanley park, capilano suspension bridge and grouse mountain.[SEP]oh![SEP]and if you have the time and wheels, why not take the ferry across to vancouver island to visit butchart gardens and victoria, you won't be disappointed!
0	there are better choices out there the stink emanating from the bathroom is the key reason i would not stay here again.[SEP]the rooms were dingy and the location is ok, but not great.[SEP]our very expensive rooms did not include breakfast, which meant shelling out 2100 yen per person for a very average buffett!![SEP]beds were lumpy, and room temp swung wildly between too hot and too cold.[SEP]the only redeeming feature of this hotel was the excellent staff, all of whom spoke fluent english (important in a crisis), and all of whom were helpful above and beyond the call of duty.[SEP]nevertheless, the rooms smelled, and at these prices, that's not cool.
0	we stayed at this hotel a few months back.[SEP]the room was a 1 star level (relative to a us hotel, it was even worse than motel6).[SEP]small room, standing shower, barely any space.[SEP]hotel itself is very dingy.[SEP]also, a fire alarm went off in the middle of a night and we saw smoke coming out from the next building.[SEP]the fire engine and cops came quickly.[SEP]the hotel staff told us' do nt worry, u r ok', but they had no info on why the fire broke out.... to me, the safety standards were shoddy![SEP]location - wise, it is far from the main attractions of rome, but it is accessible by train.[SEP]you can take the local train (dirty condition) to the city from the train station which is 5min walk from the hotel.[SEP]keep in mind the local train stops running around 10 pm or so.[SEP]the ride is ~30mins and then mostly, u have to take another train to get to where u r going.[SEP]breakfast was better than a regular continental bkfast.[SEP]overall, this hotel is worth no more than $40/night!
0	i went to this la quinta at 4929 w.[SEP]mcdowell rd.[SEP]in phoenix, arizona to get some rates on a weekly and a monthly long term stay.[SEP]i walked in to the front desk, and a hotel representative greeted me.[SEP]i asked him about their short and long term rates.[SEP]he was the rudest hotel representative, i ever spoke to.[SEP]he was trying to give me their rates while at the same time trying to start a fight.[SEP]i kept my cool and left with out renting a room.[SEP]i would never rent at this location ever.[SEP]if this is how they treat their guest, i would not want to stay there.[SEP]i found out the name of the hotel representative is nathan.[SEP]i would not recommend renting at this location for anyone.
0	spent one night, location far from centre.[SEP]room old need refurbish.[SEP]breakfast average.[SEP]nothing special.[SEP]the only benefit was have airport shuttle for free.
0	if you are traveling on business on a extended stay business trip, this hotel is comfortable and well maintained.[SEP]the facility is beautiful with a very nice pool deck and nice hot jacuzzi.[SEP]if you want a beach pr feel i would recommend elsewhere.[SEP]the location is not the best.[SEP]it truly is intended to facilitate convention goers.[SEP]the taxis in pr are now charging you 15 dollars for a one minute cameo appearance.[SEP]it costs the same to take a cab to old san juan 5 minutes than taking a cab from the airport.[SEP]this was unfortunate because the hotel is walking distance from nothing.[SEP]over all the staff in hotel very nice unlike elsewhere in pr where they have almost en entitlement mentality (taxi drivers) and give mediocre service and expect excellent tip.[SEP]i would stay here again on a business trip but a bit spendy if you are trying to watch your expenses.[SEP]i would recommend the embassy suites instead.
0	we booked the courtyard at the last minute for a trip to philadelphia to see a phillies game, and while the hotel was a fine place to stay if you were waiting for a flight at the airport, i would not reccommend it for any other type of trip simply due to its location (expect to pay $20 + per person for a taxi trip to center city or manayunk!).[SEP]when we arrived at the hotel we checked in quickly, but found that we were missing a cot we had requested in the room.[SEP]the front desk staff was very helpful and courteous, and took care of the problem right away.[SEP]there is a tgifriday's right in the parking lot, which would be very convenient for travelers.[SEP]the hotel was clean and the breakfast in the morning was sufficient.[SEP]i would recommend not staying on the first floor if you want a quieter stay, since the pool seemed to be filled with kids until a rather late hour.
0	not all the rooms in the hotel have undergone renovation, so beware when booking a run of house room from travel agent.[SEP]stayed here on two separate occasions, and the quality of the rooms varied significantly.[SEP]the level 11 room was spacious, freshly refurbished, with comfortable beds and a lcd tv.[SEP]the level 6 room was spacious but old, with hard beds, worn - out furniture, stained carpets and a mouldy smell.[SEP]for both rooms, the bathroom was dated and quality of the towels ranged from fluffy to well - worn.[SEP]we were also shown a newly renovated twin room on level 3 with contemporary furnishings and a modern glass bathroom, but the size of the room was extremely tiny.[SEP]service was also inconsistent, ranging from extremely helpful & polite staff to apathetic & gloomy - faced receptionists.[SEP]the hotel is still undergoing renovations, and the view from the hotel rooms were of bamboo scaffolding and the concrete wasteland of the old hk airport.[SEP]location - wise, the hotel is not in a touristy area and is not close to a mtr (subway) station.[SEP]however, outside the hotel there is a taxi stand (reasonable price, but not for peak hour traffic), as well as a mini - bus station (ask receptionist to change your notes to coins as the bus only accepts exact fare).[SEP]airport shuttle bus provided by the hotel was very useful.
0	i booked this hotel 6 months before going partly because a friend was staying there and partly for the facilities.[SEP]the pool and fitness centre was undergoing renovation so was unavailable.[SEP]i would never have gone there if i'd known this.[SEP]the location was a problem too, even using the free minibus to tsim tsa tsui left a 15 minute walk to the star ferry.[SEP]going out to dinner in hk meant an hour each way minimum.[SEP]rooms on club floor were surprisingly small and had no bathtub, decor rather hideous.[SEP]the club' lounge' was small and had 10 tables, no sofas.[SEP]the staff were helpful and pleasant and the snacks / drinks during happy hour were nice.[SEP]the best thing about the location were the markets and the area of mong kok around the langham place hotel.[SEP]very atmospheric at night with plenty of reasonably priced shopping.[SEP]hk island seemed to be one overpriced shopping mall with top end international brands, there are much nicer hotels with better locations at similar prices.[SEP]if i go again i will probably stay at the eaton in nathan road for the location or possibly at the langham place even though its a bit far out.
0	chose this hotel for the price and the location near relatives.[SEP]was upgraded to an executive suite which has a nice work area, two tvs and high windows -- which, unfortunately are single pane.[SEP]on these very cold (below freezing) days the two window style heaters didn't seem to work... one with paltry heat, the other blowing room temperature air.[SEP]i should have asked for another room but i chose to stick it out.[SEP]with two blankets, it was still chilly, too cold for a shower in the morning although i could warm up the bathroom with the hair dryer.[SEP]location is off the beaten path.[SEP]closest bodega is a long block away.[SEP]no coffee in the room???!![SEP]didn't use the rooftop resturant ($20 for continental breakfast) but it supposedly has good views.[SEP]parking is a reasonable $25/night (enter around the corner, almost getting on the highway there's a little alley to go around the block).[SEP]staff was nice.[SEP]room quality good - clean, a little quirky, modern decor, two tvs.[SEP]next time i would ask for another, hopefully warm (or cooler in the summer) room.[SEP]verify the heaters work!
0	went there as part of a family trip -- not my choice and not my taste.[SEP]a bleak and desolate place once you leave your rooms.[SEP]while the apartment itself is clean, nicely equipped and spacious, almost everything else is awful.[SEP]there is permanent construction noise (starting incredibly early -- around 7:30/8) -- there are currently 2 buildings in the complex and they are planning 10, so be prepared for ongoing work.[SEP]the walls are paper thin and the sound of water running in the surrounding apartments is so loud that you can't hear anything else.[SEP]the location is incredibly isolated from the strip and, while we had a car, the drive to the strip takes awhile and there is literally nothing around in walking distance except for the southpoint casino, which pales after a while.[SEP]the common spaces are jammed full of timeshare tours, at all hours of the day and into the night.[SEP]the " internet room " has only 3 computers and children using them constantly.[SEP]the pool looks nice but it's much too cold to use it at this time of year.
0	the staff was friendly and the hotel accommodations were nice, but the hotel is not in a good location if you want to spend your time downtown.[SEP]it is a $15 cab ride to duval street and a 30 min bike ride to downtown, so we found it very inconveniently located.[SEP]there is no shuttle service either.[SEP]the rooms are nice, but don't pay extra for a balcony.[SEP]they are tiny, we could hardly sit on it b / c it was so narrow and small.[SEP]our balcony looked out on the parking lot and was about 3 ft from the cars.[SEP]to make matters worse, a rooster crowed beginning every afternoon at around 3 pm and woke us up every morning.[SEP]he loves the inn's parking lot apparently![SEP]the bayside is horrible, it is located right on the road.[SEP]the bathroom vanity are entirely too small, you can hardly fit any toiletries, etc on it, especially when you have 2 people in the room.[SEP]i stayed at the westin last time and will stay there again.[SEP]it would have been the same price with the extra money spent on cab fares and bike rentals.
0	my husband and i stayed at this hotel during a european vacation a while ago.[SEP]it was disgusting.[SEP]awful.[SEP]i don't even understand how they are still in business.[SEP]everything about the hotel was dirty and unclean.[SEP]the rooms are hot with no source of ventilation.[SEP]the bathrooms were gross and tiny.[SEP]i literally walked into the room and started crying, it was that bad.[SEP]we spent the rest of the day looking for another hotel, but unfortunately during the height of tourist season, we couldn't find anything in our price range.[SEP]next time, i'll definitely loosen the purse strings a little more and get something nicer.[SEP]the location isn't that great - there is a tube station, but it's quite a walk down a very busy street to get there.[SEP]there is a grocery store next door to the hotel - that was a godsend, because we were able to get our breakfasts and such there.[SEP]the restaurants in the area are lacking.[SEP]the staff were unfriendly and unhelpful.[SEP]they hardly acknowledged us enough to give us our key.[SEP]unless you're a 16 year old on your first trip to europe and are more concerned with getting drunk and being rowdy without your parents, do yourself a favor and find a different hotel.
0	the good: clean, newer, well - lit rooms with most of the typical amenities for motels in this price range, plus a microwave and mini - fridge.[SEP]decent hot and cold breakfast buffet in a clean, inviting public dining area.[SEP]helpful staff offered to print directions, was efficient, and was responsive to minor issues such as key cards and a blow dryer that each stopped working.[SEP]location was relatively convenient to major routes to the wineries ; closest to the carneros region and the southern napa wineries.[SEP]target and grocery shopping was a quick hop away.[SEP]those with hyatt points can stay here very inexpensively, especially relative to other accommodations during the high season.[SEP]adequate close parking.[SEP]the bad: as others have noted, the location is loaded with eyesores, from the adjacent abandoned liquor store to the brightly lit car lots across the street and adjacent.[SEP]i also agree that the beds could be more comfortable.[SEP]our room near the front of the building bore the full brunt of noises all night from the busy road ; i couldn't have slept without earplugs, but perhaps rooms further from the street are quieter.[SEP]the front desk gave very poor customer service regarding a significant reservation mistake they made ; other encounters were polite, but not friendly.[SEP]those who have stayed in a hawthorn suite will miss the large kitchen area in the inn.[SEP]overall, a decent value if you're a sound sleeper not looking for a particularly romantic napa getaway.
0	pro: 1.[SEP]price: reasonable price.[SEP]i paid $115+tax.[SEP]however, for the same price, the romanico palace right next to veneto has better room.[SEP]they are owned by the same company though.[SEP]2.[SEP]free breakfast (nothing special, just bread, cake, juice and coffee) 3.[SEP]area is quiet and safe.[SEP]con: 1.[SEP]room is very small and dirty.[SEP]my room was right next to the elevator.[SEP]i can barely sleep at night.[SEP]2.[SEP]no bath, just shower.[SEP]3.[SEP]no free internet.[SEP]5 euro / hr or 10 euro/3 hrs.[SEP]internet is slow.[SEP]4.[SEP]poor location.[SEP]15 minutes uphill walk from metro.[SEP]take bus 52 53 or 63 instead.[SEP]5.[SEP]the double bed is just two combined single bed.[SEP]too short and small for americans.[SEP]6.[SEP]small tv 7.[SEP]strict check in check out policy.[SEP]11am checkout, 2pm checkout.[SEP]early checking 25euro, late checkout 45euro.[SEP]they do have free luggage storage.[SEP]conclusion: definitely not a 4 stars hotel.[SEP]more like a 3 stars in europe standard or a 2 stars in us standard.[SEP]this is one of the priceline hotel in rome.[SEP]check the price online before you place a bid.
0	the rooms are fine - just make sure if you specified a " no - smoking " room that you do get it.[SEP]they changed our room to a non - smoking without any problems.[SEP]the hotel casino / restaurant area is very smoky, and we found hard to tolerate - so went to gamble to other casinos.[SEP]its location on the strip is further from the main hotels and casinos, but the bus that goes up and down the strip stops right there.[SEP]the rate was very good, however.[SEP]we booked 4 nights with 1 of them being free.[SEP]there is a mcdonald's very close for cheap breakfast and a few places selling half - priced show tickets.[SEP]overall stay was ok, but hated the smoke - filled casino area.
0	this hotel had a good continental breakfast.,and had very clean rooms.[SEP]as far as the location, hardly any resturaunts.[SEP]not the best area, saw a prositute from time to time walking the streets.[SEP]the hotel was pretty noisy, could here the people next door and across the way.[SEP]they said we would get a queen bed, so do not believe that.[SEP]we ended up with a full bed, and was very uncomfortable, hard as a rock!!![SEP]the room was extremely small, but had a large bathroom.[SEP]instead of it being called the " best western " it should have been called the " worst western ".[SEP]never again!!!!
0	we arrived at 1:30 in the morning after 20 hours of travel and being re - routed to boston.[SEP]the beds were comfortable, the location couldn't have been more convenient and the service at the desk and shuttle were kind and helpful.[SEP]the free breakfast was more than we expected and the kids loved it.[SEP]for the price, it was an amazing value and a much needed comfortable night's sleep.[SEP]basic but clean and comfy.[SEP]expected much less for an airport hotel.
0	the property is very nice, particularly by parisian hotel standards, and the staff we encountered were all fantastic.[SEP]catherine in guest services made us feel particularly special and welcome.[SEP]the executive lounge was nice respite.[SEP]i must say, however, that if we had been paying for the room instead of using honors points, we probably would not do it again.[SEP]while it's more true in europe than anywhere else that you get what you pay for, we can get by in paris by paying a lot less.[SEP]the only other issue is the location.[SEP]the hotel is in the middle of the 8th arrondisement, and while there is a metro stop two blocks away, the 8th is just not really convenient to the hot spots of paris.
0	we stayed at the stratosphere from 1/15/2011 to 1/19/2011.[SEP]we enjoyed the stay and despite the negative reviews about the location, we found it to be ideal.[SEP]it was a short taxi ride to wonderful downtown fremont st.[SEP]and close to the new strip.[SEP]the only negative experience we had was a rash that i developed while sleeping.[SEP]we have been home a week and i still have the rash.[SEP]i went to the doctor yesterday and she said it was possible bed bug bites or an allergic reaction.[SEP]free internet with the resort fee would have been ideal.
0	the hard rock hotel / casino is at least a mile from the strip.[SEP]there is a shuttle that runs hourly to the fashion show mall, but that was inconvenient for me so i just walked.[SEP]it was a beautiful 72 degree day so it was no problem.[SEP]the rooms were nicely decorated and the bed was comfy, but the shower was bad.[SEP]it wouldn't drain so you were basically ankle - deep in water - yuck.[SEP]the same was true for the sink.[SEP]we had to do maintenance every time we used it.[SEP]the black furniture attracted major dust and someone had taken some cookies from the mini - bar and left a few in the wrapper, though we weren't charged.[SEP]we had a pool view and watched construction going on the deck the entire time we were there.[SEP]no one was swimming.[SEP]can't comment on the casino as we went to the strip to gamble with the rest of our friends, but it was small and had the overwhelming stench of cigarette smoke.[SEP]mr.[SEP]lucky's restaurant had a good breakfast and prompt service.[SEP]would not stay again mostly due to location and drainage issues.
0	we came here on a city break and booked through last minute.com, so got a great deal.[SEP]we arrived at the airport and got a taxi, knowing that it wasn't that far from the airport.[SEP]unfortunately, there was a minimum taxi fare, which more than covered the journey, but we paid it anyway.[SEP]despite worrying when we arrived that the hotel is on a noisy roundabout, inside the hotel, you can't hear the traffic.[SEP]the reception is very impressive with an art deco feel.[SEP]staff are very friendly and helpful.[SEP]we had a standard room, which was smaller than we expected, but very clean.[SEP]bathroom was spectacular with a great shower![SEP]the location isn't too bad, we were aware that it was a little bit out of the town, but there was a regular bus service into town, which the hotel provide for free.[SEP]otherwise we would use the subway, which was as short walk away.[SEP]average journey into the centre of the town was about 1/2hour.[SEP]i would recommend this if you don't mind making the journey in and out of the city centre.[SEP]but, watch out for the confusing lift buttons... sounds stupid but the fancy computer system on the ground floor didn't work very well!
0	i stayed here for 6 nights while in boston for the marathon in april 2009.[SEP]this is a peak time for hotels in boston, so perhaps prices go up.[SEP]but still, i think we paid $170 per night which for a hotel of this standard was very poor value.[SEP]the hotel is right next to a busy highway and unfortunately our room was the closest possible to the road.[SEP]this meant a lot of noise, and interrupted sleep.`not great preparation for the marathon.[SEP]the nicest thing about the hotel was the other guests, particularly those staying for the marathon.[SEP]nice camaraderie.[SEP]breakfast was poor, but it often is in the usa.[SEP]i love travelling to the states but hotel breakfasts are usually so mean and functional.[SEP]location was poor too.[SEP]it was about a 10 minute walk to the local subway.[SEP]there is a local shopping / retail park with a supermarket, a couple of restaurants and some electronic goods shops.[SEP]it's generally a rather run - down area.[SEP]in retrospect we should have paid a bit more and got somewhere nicer in the city centre.[SEP]that said, during marathon week these hotels go for $250-$300 a night.[SEP]a good alternative would have been to go for a hotel at one of the extremes of the subway system i.e. gone right out of town.[SEP]probably a lot cheaper and more pleasant than this.[SEP]i wouldn't say don't stay at the hie, but i would say don't stay for 6 nights![SEP]i reckon 2 is a good maximum.
0	positives (this will be quick): rooms are large and clean with nice views.[SEP]negatives: 1.[SEP]almost 9 miles from anything worth doing when in las vegas (must do a taxi or the hotel shuttle (which fills up quickly) to get to the strip).[SEP]2.[SEP]crawling with locals and low - class types -- i saw more mullets in one location than i once previously thought possible.[SEP]3.[SEP]cigarette smoke throughout the casino is overwhelming.[SEP]i tried to enjoy a few slots and ended up' cashing - out' and calling it a night.[SEP]4.[SEP]worth repeating -- a sketchy low - class crowd.
0	i stayed for 4 nights in a huge, clean room.[SEP]unfortunately, it was extremely loud.[SEP]the hotel has no a / c, so i tried to leave the window open a little, but the traffic was way too loud.[SEP]make sure to ask for a room out back, not facing the busy street.[SEP]the breakfast and shower were great, the staff so - so, not very motivated, but will help you if prompted.[SEP]it is quite far from the touristy parts of berlin, you have to take several busses.[SEP]i probably would not stay there again, even though it turned out fine, mainly because of the noise and the location.[SEP]i noticed that another reviewer praised the sauna and pool, the hotel actually has neither.
0	four of us decided to enjoy sunset by the pool with a few margaritas.[SEP]we went to dinner at a local restaurant and arrived at the pool near 6 pm.[SEP]the guys in the group went to get drinks and were directed by the bartender to go to the clubhouse, as the pool bar was closing.[SEP]the clubhouse told them that their liquor license did not allow them to serve us drinks to take to the pool.[SEP]i questioned the bartender, who was very rude, and asked for a manager.[SEP]the manager, ryan, confirmed that the concession to the restaurant and the pool bar had been sold to different parties effective jan 2006.[SEP]as a result, liquor laws did not allow them to serve liquor in the other location.[SEP]we actually observed the pool staff confiscate someone else's drink.[SEP]later, we left the pool and went to the clubhouse for drinks and appetizers.[SEP]karen, an excellent waitress, indicated that while they could give us drinks in plastic cups to take to our room, we shouldn't take them to the pool because they would be taken from us.[SEP]i can't imagine that a resort would expected vacationers not to enjoy a drink by the pool at sunset.[SEP]it is an essential part of the vacation experience for me.
0	we found the stratosphere to be a very clean and reasonably priced hotel.[SEP]but... if you're lookng for evening entertainment away from the gaming tables then this isn't the place for you![SEP]it's own nightclub has closed down and the advertised' live nightly entertainment' simple didn't exist.[SEP]you need to head down the strip for your evening jollies.[SEP]this isn't a great problem as the deuce bus stops right outside the hotel, but the ride down the busy strip can take an hour![SEP]it's just as quick to walk but is a bit of a trek to find the action, and it's best not to wander around the area near the strat after dark.[SEP]we were happy with the strat for this holiday, but wouldn't stay there next time as it's just too far from the fun.[SEP]however, if the location doesn't bother you then there's nothing wrong with staying here.
0	a few points to keep in mind when you book your stay at disney resorts.[SEP]the port orleans hotels are offered in the lower priced packages.[SEP]overall i would say they are a decent value.[SEP]however, the port orleans locations pack more people in one location and these locations seem to be furthest from the parks.[SEP]the biggest disappointment was the " magical express " buses to the parks.[SEP]we continually had to wait in long lines for the buses and they make stops at four different depots in port orleans going to and coming from the parks.[SEP]door to door to a park took well over 40 minutes each trip and the buses were packed.[SEP]overall, disney has become overwhelming with lines for everything.[SEP]you find yourself in a constant rush and wait cycle.
0	this hotel is cleas, with a wetroom for a bathroom.[SEP]the internet site we booked with siad it was a central location.[SEP]it is not.[SEP]it is a 20 min tram ride, that s when you have figured out the tram.[SEP]we arrived late at night and even the cab driver had no idea where it was.[SEP]we spent an hour walking around the residential area that it is in, trying to find it.[SEP]when returning from town a second night, the other cab driver had no idea either![SEP]it is nice, but stay nearer town.
0	it was okay.[SEP]i expected better based on previous reviews.[SEP]location is central and very close to friedrichstrasse train station, making it very convenient, however, i generally find areas that close to train stations are a little unsavory, and this was no exception.[SEP]we saw a couple iv needles on the ground and a used condom.[SEP]the accommodations themselves were good.[SEP]for whatever reason our room didn't get cleaned one day - not a huge issue as we're fairly tidy people, but would have appreciated it.[SEP]we've found most hotels these days offer free wi - fi and were quite surprised at the astronomical charges they had for theirs.[SEP]overall, we didn't find the staff very friendly.
0	the location of this place is hard to find and trying to locate their parking lot is not any easier, especially when you pull up to the hotel and one of the employees just stares at you and your car and doesn't even ask of you need help.[SEP]the front desk person who checked me in was very unfriendly and had 0 personality and was frankly unwelcoming however works in hospitality which is ironic.[SEP]i stayed in one of the non - cabana rooms which i had to walk through the hotel and outside to get to.[SEP]the lobby and meeting room areas where fill of junk and messy.[SEP]the hotel is basic in everyway possible and the bathrooms remind me of a motel 6.[SEP]granted you should know that i'm a diamond hhonors member and they should at least true try to give me a decent room that doesn't overlook the street parking and power plant.
0	fine airport hotel it gets the job done as an airport hotel but that's about it.[SEP]the free shuttle picked us up at 1 am from the airport and drove us back in the morning.[SEP]the location is creepy but who cares.[SEP]i wouldn't stay here for any reason but convenience to the airport.[SEP]if you need to call the shuttle, the hotel phone number is on the hotel shuttle pick up sign outside the airport.
0	there is good and bad about this hotel.[SEP]it is very close to the airport and ostia antica.[SEP]if those are your main requirements then it is a big, plain, clean, business class hotel with good included breakfast.[SEP]we had a very, very early flight out of rome and the hotel worked great for that.[SEP]if you do not need to stay by the airport or ostia antica then don't stay here.[SEP]for the same money you can stay at a really nice place right in rome (and still do ostia as a day trip on the subway).[SEP]i found this hotel to be too expensive for the location.
0	my first thought was " you have to be kidding me ".[SEP]the staff was particularly unhelpful, nothing at the hotel was like the photos on expedia, the rooms tiny, filthy and poorly equipped, in desparate need not so much of a deep cleaning but of replacement, the amenities virtually non - existent (and tvs that barely show a handful of channels) and the location is inconvenient.[SEP]we spent the most unpleasant night ever and checked the next morning into another hotel.[SEP]we made reservations here in reliance of the images shown and the name aparthotel but this property has no such thing as apartments and the staff very rudely suggested that if we wanted that kind of service we should have checked into a " better " hotel.[SEP]stay here if you like to suffer.
0	we searched the internet for hotels in dubai finding this one based on price, location and amenities as described on the website, " hotels - n - europe.com ".[SEP]we traveled 18 hours by air with a taxi to the hotel, only to find they didn't have a room for us and could not find our reservation.[SEP]we presented our copy of the confirmation and it was a complete surprise to them.[SEP]all they were willing to give us was a smoking twin.[SEP]we left immediately and went to the hyatt.
0	i stayed at the marriott courtyard miramar for two nights in early december.[SEP]i enjoyed my stay for several reasons: 1) the hotel staff were exceptionally courteous and helpful, 2) the room was exceptionally clean and well cared for ; i couldn't find anything to complain about, 3) the restauraunt served an excellent breakfast which was either buffet style or off the menu style, 4) the restaurant converted to a french style restaurant in the evening and was excellent in quality although somewhat pricey.[SEP]my only minor complaint was the location of the hotel made it a bit difficult to find at night and i did not feel comfortable going out by foot at night.[SEP]old san juan and other points of interest required a taxi to reach.[SEP]ratewise i felt the hotel was fairly priced ; i paid about $140/night after having booked the reservation through the marriott website and choosing the " senior rate " (62 years or older).[SEP]i am returning to san juan in january and will be staying at the courtyard marriott miramar once again.
0	first the good news: the location is handy for the colosseum and the metro.[SEP]but sadly the two things you * don't * need in rome are to be close to the colosseum or close to the metro: for a start you'll probably only visit the colosseum once, and the metro doesn't go anywhere visitors want to go (it's not easy to dig tunnels under the roman city).[SEP]and the location downside is that half the rooms look out over one of rome's busiest roads.[SEP]if you like sleeping either keep the windows shut and sweat (no aircon in january) or try to sleep through the sound of a thousand vespas.[SEP]the bedrooms are clean but they don't look to have been refurbished in recent years.[SEP]hair dryer fell apart.[SEP]downstairs the foyer and bar are usually empty, except when occupied by swarms of bewildered tour - bus victims.[SEP]breakfast is ok but not in the league of the international chains.[SEP]this place describes itself as a business hotel so if you can get a good price it's a reliable choice.[SEP]no local character though, and not a particularly pleasant part of town, unless you're interested in traffic.
0	i stay at this hotel quite often whilst on my trips and connecting journeys to amsterdam.[SEP]the hotel's location is a bit out of the main tourist areas but is served well efficiently, to & from the hotel with the 15 minutes shuttle leaving from nh barbizon palace, opposite centraal station.[SEP]the rooms are of high standards with all the amenities you would expect from a 4 star rated property despite it actually having an official 3 stars.[SEP]it deserves better.[SEP]bathrooms are very clean and more than well equipped.[SEP]constantly the toileteries' selection is more generous than most other hotel companies i have stayed with.[SEP]tv with few english and european channels are avaialble in the rooms.[SEP]beds are very comfortable.[SEP]the check - in staff are polite and helpful and they do actually try to remember that you stayed here before![SEP]also i get to meet the northwest airlines flight - crew in the mornings, everytime when i am checking out and they are leaving for schiphol for their flight.[SEP]overall a highly recommended hotel for an extremely reasonable price.
0	the hotel itself is nice enough for a doubletree.[SEP]we had a one bedroom suite with our infant and it was quite nice.[SEP]the hotel provided us a crib but had no highchairs as other hotels often do.[SEP]we had a nice room on the 6th floor overlooking the bay.[SEP]while the kitchen does have a microwave and a mini fridge, it has no other provisions (plates, paper towels, silverware).[SEP]other doubletree hotels we've stayed at have been much better stocked.[SEP]in addition, the neighborhood is a bit rough around the edges.[SEP]with a baby, we weren't taking public transportation and had to drive into boston daily.[SEP]this is not that bad of a drive, but not too convenient overall.[SEP]if you want to stay at a downtown boston hotel, this location is not for you.[SEP]other than the t, there is no where to walk from this hotel (and even if there was, i wouldn't walk late at night or by myself).
0	traveled to san diego on business and stayed two nights in the hotel.[SEP]the hotel is a very beautiful and historic hotel in downtown san diego.[SEP]the lobby and public spaces are beautiful.[SEP]as for service, it was up and down.[SEP]i twisted my ankle badly while in san diego and they took good care of me by checking in on me and sending ice to my room.[SEP]their color printer was out in the business center and they sent me out to get color copies elsewhere and this is how i twisted my ankle in the first place.[SEP]then when i limped back in, the same person who sent me out offered to do the color prints in the back office.[SEP]if they would have offered that in the first place, i may not be in a brace today.[SEP]the location is not the best.[SEP]it is a good ways from the gas lamp district and is not in the middle of the action.[SEP]one thing that surprised me was that they had a huge reception for a company in the lobby which cut - off access to the restaurant and bar.[SEP]i have rarely seen a hotel have a reception in the middle of the lobby and in their highest traffic area.[SEP]this was not good considering i could barely walk and had to settle for room service.[SEP]bottom line, if historical elegance is your thing than you will love this hotel.[SEP]if you are more interested in a trendy atmosphere and a good location then you should look elsewhere in san diego.
0	past it's prime first the location, its not that great, removed from hong kong island.[SEP]it's a fast trip on the subway, but spend the extra money and stay on hong kong island.[SEP]the hotel is very dated, i don't believe the hotel has been renovated since it was built in the 1980's.[SEP]also we where upgrated for free to the excutive floor and the room smelled bad.[SEP]also the wallpaper was pealing and bubbling.[SEP]the overall experience was not one i would recommond to anyone.
0	the hotel itself was ok.[SEP]the location was great., close to bugis and the railway station.[SEP]two local food courts next door.[SEP]what we didn't like was getting ripped off with the price.[SEP]singapore must be the only country in the world that quotes a figure then adds + + +.[SEP]we also asked for the quoted price to include breakfast.[SEP]found out when we checked in that the breakfast was extra.[SEP]also we asked for a room for 3 adults.[SEP]we got a double room with a spare bed put inbetween the other two beds with no gaps inbetween.[SEP]result, extremely squashed up, only one person could walk in the room at a time.[SEP]there was drilling etc work going on next door and it began at 6 in the morning.[SEP]very noisy.[SEP]we went on our cruise and stayed at a different hotel on our return, same thing happened.[SEP]+ + + was added to out bill and no breakfast was quoted for although i had requested it.[SEP]apart from that very annoying trait of singapor hotels we were pleasantly surprised at the honesty of the taxi drivers.[SEP]they were very helpful and didn't take us the long way around as they had done some years back when we last visited.
0	i travel a lot and stay at a lot of hotels.[SEP]i was disappointed in the fact how noisy the room was and the distance to the gas lamp district, the fact you pay $32 a day for valet parking which really is the only option.[SEP]though a garage is right there you pay $28 a day so for $4.00 more, why wouldn't you valet?[SEP]other than that the room was a nice size with a decent sized bathroom.[SEP]the hotel was clean.[SEP]we did order room service one night and it was good.[SEP]they thanked us about 20 times for using them.[SEP](obviously very few people do.) if i had to do it over again, i wouldn't have stayed here based on location.[SEP]if i had to be in area, it wouldn't be a bad choice.
0	i liked the comfort of the beds, the flow of water in the shower, and the helpfulness of the staff, but that is pretty much it.[SEP]aside from the convenient location to the metromover, which was all we needed to get to the bayside station.[SEP]the hotel needs to seriously upgrade its rooms to be in par with other establishments.[SEP]it lacks a new television sets.[SEP]switching between channels was quite dreadful ; the volume was vastly different for every other station.[SEP]the room was a bit dusty and the coffee station did not have stir sticks.[SEP]in addition, it did not enough tea bags for two people.[SEP]with the absents of bath towels in our room, especially after haven already taking a shower, made the experience of drying off a difficult challenge.[SEP]the area is not safe to walk around with panhandlers lurking around, if the burger king needs security at night, this is a clear indication that you better stay inside and order in.[SEP]we witnessed an arrest by hotel security staff after a man refused to leave the motor lobby.[SEP]btw, when you arrive at the hotel, it is quite confusing where the check in is located (2nd floor).[SEP]in this case, i would suggest more signage for those arriving at the hotel.
0	check - in was slow, carried my bags to my room.[SEP]room as per other reviews was snug.[SEP]bathroom was tiny but adequate for single traveller not intent on living in the bathroom.[SEP]had upstairs bed, two lcd tvs in a room that would not have felt out of place on a cruise ship (small, confined).[SEP]location is ok but taxis not easy to get in the evening.[SEP]room had been cleaned but a few things missed (hair on the floor).[SEP]would not recommend for more than one person and definitely not for those with kids (or traveller likely to engage in alcohol consumption) as stairs to bed was an accident waiting to happen.[SEP]internet sevice was free but very slow.[SEP]may look hip and cool but there are cooler, cheaper and more comfortable places to stay in singapore.
0	there is basically no reason to stay at the las vegas hilton when you could enjoy one of the other fantastic options around town.[SEP]first of all, the hotel is reminiscent of the 1970's, both in decor, patronage, and amenities.[SEP]case in point - both barry manilow and abba have had shows at the hilton each time i have visited the spot.[SEP]the rooms have been broken in, with outdated decor, older televisions, dirty tapestries, and more.[SEP]the crowd is cheesy and older... be prepared to see some interesting characters in wacky clothing.[SEP]lastly, the hotel is located off of the strip and basically out of the way from all of the action.[SEP]this is not your typical, upscale hilton, but a budget vegas hotel hiding behind a positive brand name.[SEP]if you are looking for more affordable options, i would suggest checking into the flamingo, tropicana, bally's, or something actually on the strip.[SEP]you might have a similar " cheese - factor " (as i like to call it), but at least you will enjoy a nice pool and a better location.
0	we stayed on saturday night.[SEP]the hotel was clean and our rooms were spacious.[SEP]the location is not ideal but a cab cost approx £ 17 from the hotel to covent garden.[SEP]be warned there was karaoke playing next door until around 3 in the morning meaning we got very little sleep.[SEP]we complained at 2 am but were not given another room and it appears this is a regular occurrence rather than a one off.[SEP]would not recommend this hotel because of the noise.[SEP]shame because the actual hotel was better than others i have stayed in for a similar price.
0	i do hope you drove here.[SEP]otherwise there is nothing in walking distance.[SEP]besides the location the rooms are nice and the staff was was helpful when confronted, otherwise they seem to busy to notice you.[SEP]also bring your large wallet for the hotel bar.[SEP]we were going to have dinner and drinks but found out what our first two drinks cost payed our bill and had room service for dinner and breakfast the next day.[SEP]its a sad day when hotel room service is cheaper then the menu at a sports bar attached to a marriott.
0	booked in for 3 nights last week at a very good rate and was happy with its location off the strip but close to the main casinos.[SEP]the room was fine with 2 queen beds, fridge, tv and micro.[SEP]we found a few things missing such as the coffee pot + batteries in tv remote and although it was 2200 the reception staff had replacements from another room within minutes.[SEP]the drawback was being situated under the flightpath as from 0530 to 2300 there were aircraft every few minutes, which woke me up although handy on the last day as we had an early start![SEP]the pool was fine, for brits, the water was quite warm and clean, with many people congregating around it with beers each afternoon, but the kids and i enjoyed it.[SEP]comments about the lapdancing place next door seem way over the top, no noise or fuss from it.[SEP]breakfast was adequate, but only having one toaster in the kitchen for numerous guests was quite poor given the numbers staying at the hotel.[SEP]also it closed early for breakfast 0600 - 0900.[SEP]didn't use the shuttle to the strip, happy with self parking and a bit of a walk.[SEP]overall good for the price, but the early / late flights disturbs your sleep.
0	attended a two day meeting here so had no say in the choice of hotel.[SEP]hotel is kind of ok - it's not my cup of tea at all in that it's big and impersonal and corporate, but it kind of worked, the staff were good, breakfast was good, bedroom was a bit spartan and soul - less.[SEP]worst thing really is location, in a god - forsaken building - site suburb of the city undergoing massive high - rise industrial development.[SEP]constant drone of construction machinery even on the upper floors of the hotel.[SEP]if coming to barcelona on a romantic break you do not want to stay around here.
0	i liked the hotel but expected better.[SEP]i had some minor problems with room service (45 min on the phone waiting for someone) but when i complained food came right away and was good.[SEP]little things like the bar had no orange juice in the morning.[SEP]the tray stayed outside my door until 2 pm next day (i called to have it cleaned).[SEP]but overall you can have a nice stay and front desk was excellent service.[SEP]very nice business center and gym with indoor pool (i did not use both).[SEP]location is about 10 min (12 $by taxi) to michigan ave.[SEP]there is nothing around the hotel at walking distance.[SEP]the mccomick place convention center is impressive.[SEP]overall to me looked like a good hotel which is targeted toward groups for meetings and not single tourists.
0	stayed here at the end of june, and was pleasantly surprised to receive a glass of cava on arrival the hotel is modern, the rooms are well equipped and comfortable, and the staff were very friendly.[SEP]the choice at breakfast was enormous.[SEP]the only downside is that there was no balcony, but then this is more of a business hotel than a tourist hotel.[SEP]in terms of location - the hotel is about a 10 minute walk from the olympic port, and about 20 - 25 minutes from las ramblas.[SEP]it is not the prettiest walk to the center, although we did not feel particularly threatened at any point.[SEP]the area around the hotel is residential, and i would not in any way compare it to " the scariest council estate in london " as other contributors have.[SEP]however, the location is the only drawback with this hotel, and the reason it did not receive top marks.
0	the room was pretty clean except for a few long black hairs in the bathroom which shouldn't be there for a hotel of this level.[SEP]the location is isolated from entertainment.[SEP]it is located right on the marina which is very nice.[SEP]if you want to go anywhere it's gon na run 10 dollars minimum for a taxi to grab a bite to eat.[SEP]also, you'll pay $12 a day for internet in your room.[SEP]and $12 if you take a drink from the minibar.
0	without doubt, this is a lovely hotel: very modern, chic, and twenty - first century.[SEP]the room is huge ; this is the only time i might complain about the room being too big.[SEP]in my opinion, the hotel is overpriced at approximately $200 (us) per night.[SEP]if your aim is to be near the st.[SEP]catherine street shopping area, the location is perfect.[SEP]if, however, you desire to be spend your time in old montreal, near the docks, or at cirque de soleil, it is quite a hike from le square phillips hotel.[SEP]concierge service lackluster.[SEP]for our purposes, our stay in the holiday inn express in chinatown was far better.[SEP]the property does not meet the standard of le square phillip, but the location is great (a couple of blocks from notre dame basilica) and forty percent cheaper.
0	i had booked three nights at this hotel and upon arrival i was told that it is overbooked and i will have to spend one night in their sister hotel.[SEP]the question is - how can it be overbooked when at the time of reservation it was confirmed as available?![SEP]after reading other reviews it seems common problem in this hotel and the managment of hotel should sort it out once and forever![SEP]very poor organisation![SEP]they wasted about 2 hours in total of my precious time with all transfers to and back again.[SEP]next, when checking in, receptionist took copy of my passport (!) instead of filling a form.[SEP]who knows what can happen with it if gets in wrong hands?[SEP]at he end it turned out, he had mixed my country of origin up in the file in computer, which was more than irritating![SEP]there was absolutely nothing exciting about this place - small room, horrible breakfast with terrible, kinda old tasting coffee and not fresh cheese and ham.[SEP]location is bad too, nearest metro station is good walk away, bus stop is only some 15 m away but it takes about half an hour to reach city centre.[SEP]and i almost forgot, you will be asked to leave the key, whenever you go out, what will cause additional inconvenience![SEP]i certainly won't be back at this hotel and i will tell to all my friends to do the same!
1	location is excellent for sfmoma & other museums, union sq shopping and restaurants, financial district.[SEP]room and service are fine as you'd expect.[SEP]a little annoying: 2-elevator - trip to get in and out of the building ; advertised courtesy car- starts at 5 pm, there is only one, first - come - first - served, expect to take cabs.[SEP]really annoying at all four seasons: $15/day for internet access when it is free at many inexpensive and moderately - priced hotels and it is not even available in lobbies.[SEP]breakfast at seasons is reasonably expensive and very nice.[SEP]sun & mon $20-burger-&-wine - or - beer is a good deal.[SEP]good alternatives: mandarin (after their renovation is complete in spr 2012) for gorgeous views ; ritz carlton if you don't mind being on nob hill.
1	i recently stayed here for a business trip and really liked the hotel.[SEP]it's in a great location attached to the mall, so it was super convenient to get morning coffee, stop at a restaurant and do some quick shopping between meetings.[SEP]i used the valet at checkin, as i arrived late in the evening and had bags to carry.[SEP]glad i did that.[SEP]the free parking lot nearby gets full in the evening, but seems open during the day.[SEP]the room was very modern and comfortable, typical of a westin property.[SEP]i love oceanaire and enjoyed eating there one night.[SEP]i met colleagues for a late dinner / drinks at the second floor bistro and enjoyed that too, although we were greeted rudely at arrival and asked not to be loud.[SEP]really?[SEP]the bar was packed, but there were exactly two people in the bistro itself, so they could have used some " loud, " aka guests.[SEP]other than that, i wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.
1	the hotel l'empereur just finished its complete renovation.[SEP]it is now owned by mme.[SEP]pelletier who owns the hotel muguet on the same block.[SEP]we had stayed at muguet several times since 1998 (before it was discovered by the ny times).[SEP]we tried to reserve there this trip, but they were fully booked.[SEP]they suggested we try l'empereur.[SEP]we were very pleased with this hotel ; the location is between the eiffel tower and invalides.[SEP]the hotel was beautifully redone, with tasteful furnishings and great bathrooms.[SEP]the service was wonderful ; knowledgeable and willing.[SEP]the room we had was decent size for paris and a good value.[SEP]our view was of the dome of the hotel invalides (see photos).
1	we just returned home from a 5-night stay at the brookshire and it was great![SEP]we had booked using a groupon deal and we chose a 1-bedroom suite, which is exactly what we were given.[SEP]our room was on the 9th floor and it was a corner unit facing the inner harbor - gorgeous view![SEP]yes, the furniture / decor is older and needs replacing at some point, but the room was very clean and perfect for what we needed.[SEP]every employee we encountered was smiling and pleasant!!![SEP]when we returned in the evening, the person at the front desk would say " welcome back![SEP]".[SEP]the valet parking was fast - no problems.[SEP]the breakfast buffet that is included is plentiful and everything seemed fresh.[SEP]though we only made it to one evening's manager's reception, it was a very nice amenity.[SEP]beer and wine were offered along with a decent selection of snacks to go along with your drink - a nice perk![SEP]unfortunately, during our stay my step - daughter and i became ill and were in the hotel room for the better part of 2 days - despite this, i found the suite to be very comfortable and loved the fact that you could open the windows to allow fresh air in.[SEP]we made a few requests at check - in and during our stay and none of them were a problem![SEP]you cannot beat the location of this hotel - one block up from the inner harbor - we walked there, to power plant live, little italy, camden yards, federal hill etc etc, we will return!
1	we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.[SEP]the hotel was very clean and the staff extremely friendly.[SEP]the location was perfect for us to go to lincoln park, as well as the restaurants that are popular such as rainforest cafe, hardrock cafe, ed debevics and gino's east.[SEP]the only negative was parking which cost $35/night, but there was parking available across the expressway for $20/night.[SEP]we were very happy to have dominic's and walgreen's across the street for last minute items as well as groceries.
1	our family of 3 (12 year old daughter) stayed at the bc for 6 nights in february.[SEP]we had a great time and loved the location and amenities this hotel had to offer.[SEP]i booked a standard room but i think we were upgraded to a water view (although they didn't tell us that at check in - which was a breeze by the way.[SEP]our room had a nice size balcony (another nice surprise) and a view of the quiet pool and boardwalk, on the epcot end of the hotel - defn.[SEP]a location i would recommend.[SEP]the room was very clean, with a small fridge and 2 queen beds.[SEP]the murphy bed was not something i would want to sleep on and i'm glad we didn't have to use it.[SEP]housekeeping did a nice job but they did come late in the day (3 or 4oclock).[SEP]the quiet pool was very nice, warm and quiet.[SEP]i only stuck my foot in' stormalong bay' and it seemed very cold to me.[SEP]there were plenty of lifeguards around the large pool but none by the quiet pool.[SEP]plenty of lounge chairs by the pool and along the beach.[SEP]staff was always very polite, always with a warm hello.[SEP]i could complain about the lateness of housekeeping, room service trays left in the hall a bit too long and the temp of the big pool, but all the other services and amenities more than made up for any small inconveniences along the way.
1	i paid a little bit extra for a canal view room and have to say it made the stay, a 2nd floor room with full length opening windows gave stunning views on one of the busiest points of the grand canal.[SEP]relaxing in the nights with a bottle of wine and watching the boats passing by was a wonderful experience.[SEP]the room itself was fine ; good size and clean with period furniture.[SEP]staff were friendly and particularly helpful on reception.[SEP]breakfast was the usual continental buffet and sets you up for the day.[SEP]i didnâ€ ™ t eat there in the night so can't comment on the restaurant.[SEP]location is great for arrival in venice ; it's opposite the train station and is a 5 minute walk over one bridge.[SEP]if your arriving by train or bus, itâ€ ™ s a 10 minute walk and fairly easy to find.[SEP]boats stops are nearby so itâ€ ™ s easy to get around venice.[SEP]we preferred to navigate through the tight alleyways of santa croce and itâ€ ™ s about a 30 minute walk to san marco via the rialto bridge.[SEP]overall itâ€ ™ s an excellent hotel, particularly if you want to explore more than just san marco.
1	i had stayed at the boardwalk inn in 1997 with family and liked it a lot.[SEP]i especially liked the location and as we were a couple of " oldies " our aim was to avoid noisy kiddie crowds and this hotel seemed the best choice.[SEP]it is closest to the parks we wanted to visit.[SEP]we had no wait at all checking in about 1pm on a monday afternoon and were upgaded to a villa / cottage.[SEP]i'm really not sure what they called it but it was nice and quiet and right by the pool and way more room than we needed.[SEP]since we were out all day we made little use of the lower level.[SEP]but the fridge was handy.[SEP]our biggest complaint was the price of getting a breakfast reasonably.[SEP]my husband really like a good fiber cereal and it cost us one snack point or over $3 for a dinky box of raisin bran and milk.[SEP]i still love the this hotel but really think free wi - fi for in rooms is not too much to ask.[SEP]i opted for 1 24 period during our 3 night stay.
1	we stayed here in november and found the hotel was the ideal location for visiting the city, just off the piazza del popolo.[SEP]the room was fine, very clean, but a bit hot, so we turned the air con off.[SEP]the only minor thing was we had an adjoining door to the next room so you could hear their conversations![SEP]the breakfast was delicious and plenty to choose from including prosecco for a bucksfizz![SEP]highly recommend happy hour and their wonderful cocktails and snacks.[SEP]we found that to get from the airport to rome there were many different suggestions, but we used terrevison buses which took 45mins and cost 4 euros each return, bargain.
1	a hotel with a good and quiet location, very clean rooms, but with an innaceptable tax on using the internet (12 eur for 1 hour), while others hotels offers this for free.[SEP]probably the management considers the internet a luxury and feel the urge to get some money out of this as well!!![SEP]the concierge staff was polite and helpful, but somehow bored, ending by forgetting once to make us a reservation for a sightseeing tour, a tour that, amazingly, they promote the moment you check in![SEP]as a result, we were waiting for ages in the lobby of the hotel, being assured that we'll be picked up by a car that never showed up.[SEP]instead, when we gave a phone call to the agency (vastours), we discovered that the hotel didn't do any reservation and that we have to grab a taxi and go to vastours where we could joined the other visitors.[SEP]as a result, the morning we had to leave to the airport, we were afraid to use their wake - up call, thinking of the same neglicence!
1	downsides: roomkeys not working properly and having to be reactivated almost daily, bugs around the pool, breakfast was minimal, transportation to and from the airport would've been handy.[SEP]on the up side: the location is great with a bus stop right in front, many restaurants and shops on walking distance, shuttle service to multiple parks, simple but quiet rooms (we slept very well), microwave and fridge in the rooms which is a real plus, friendly and helpful staff (including the cleaning lady and shuttle driver).[SEP]this last point was particularly pleasant to us being from holland and needing more information than a local guest would, so we had some nice chats with mr.[SEP]b.[SEP](front desk) and felt right at home.[SEP]all in all, the good definitely trumps the' bad':)
1	very friendly staff.[SEP]free hot drinks at all times, free water bottles and wine at 5 pm was a nice touch.[SEP]they moved a fridge into our room when they saw we had some perishables.[SEP]the hotel was very clean and has a nice decor.[SEP]the rooms were a bit on the small side.[SEP]there were no special children activities but we managed fine.[SEP]we ate at the hotel once for breakfast and found it average.[SEP]there is a large supermarket next door which is very convenient.[SEP]in terms of location, it is the back bay area.[SEP]the park is walking distance.[SEP]i think the marketplace area is more interesting.[SEP]however, we had a good rate on the room and i think it is simply better to just take a couple of cabs if needed.[SEP]the only negative is that we valet parked are our car one night and by bad chance there was some white goop on the windshield which took some time to get off.[SEP]after that, my husband parked the care himself!
1	my daughter and i have just returned from 6 nights at the residenza ki.[SEP]we found it to be a hotel that suited our needs entirely.[SEP]as other reviewers have indicated there is not much of a front to the hotel.[SEP]it is simply a door into a block of apartments.[SEP]we arrived late but were met at the door, greeted by name and made welcome.[SEP]throughout the stay francesco was friendly and helpful, without being too pushy.[SEP]the rooms are simple, but they are clean and comfortable.[SEP]breakfast was what we expected rolls, cereal, croissants etc.[SEP]it was fresh and tasty.[SEP]the best feature of the residenza is definitely its location.[SEP]from the hotel we managed to walk to everywhere we wanted to get to in about 30 minutes.[SEP]the vatican, coliseum and bioparc are all with 30 minutes walk.[SEP]the trevi fountain is about 2 minutes away with the spanish steps about 4.[SEP]there are so many restaurants with 2 or 3 minutes we tried several different ones each day and were never disappointed with any of them.[SEP]the termini station would have been a bit too far to walk carrying luggage so getting a taxi was a good idea.[SEP]the hotel is not a luxury accommodation with everything provided in house, but then it does not charge for these features we did not want.[SEP]for us it was a clean, warm and friendly hotel in a brilliant location.
1	we stayed here in 2010 for a weekend and the hotel was in a great location in the cbd, only a short walk away from the train station and easy to find.[SEP]the room itself was slightly dated but was clean and very well maintained.[SEP]part of the hotel is in a heritage building with beautiful features, we were tempted to due high tea here due to the atmosphere.[SEP]the lobby is grand and the room was spacious with a modern bathroom and tv.[SEP]as an spg platinum guest there which provided us with access to the lounge which included breakfast and evening snacks and wine as an added bonus.
1	tempo hotel is great hotel with nice rooms, an amazing view, easy access to miami beach.[SEP]friendly staff and pool lounge area is a beautiful place.[SEP]good breakfast (not included, but very good for the price) and free wi - fi in the building.[SEP]the bathroom is realy good, with bathtub and a good shower, but be aware: no door between bathroom and bedroom, so if youâ´re staying with someone youâ´re not intimate, might be a little awkward.[SEP]in general, the hotel is really nice, i recommend it.[SEP]if youâ´re going in a cruise is the perfect location, itâ´s right in front of miami port.
1	i stayed here for two - nights during a business trip in sydney.[SEP]i stayed here primarily for its location and that it is part of the spg network of hotels.[SEP]location it is located in the beautiful area of darling harbour and, if you get a harbour view, gives a grand view of darling harbour.[SEP]the rooms on the other side of the hotel will have views of buildings across the street.[SEP]it is walking distance to townhall station and george street shops.[SEP]from townhall station, you can pretty much go everywhere in sydney.[SEP]so the location is very convenient.[SEP]amenities i have to say that i was disappointed with the amenities.[SEP]first off, the carpet looks old and worn out.[SEP]i don't know if its simply the shade and pattern of the carpet but it gives of a weary look.[SEP]the wooden furniture are very dated and could stand to be upgraded.[SEP]the bathroom still uses white square tiles that reminds me of old houses.[SEP]the worst is the shower / bath tub combination.[SEP]i'm 5'10, so i'm neither short nor am i overly tall.[SEP]the space is so cramped that i've banged my elbows twice and even hit my head on the wall once while taking a shower.[SEP]the bed and the tv was decent.[SEP]if not for the great location, i would have scored them lower due to their amenities that, in my opinion, badly needs an upgrade.[SEP]service service was average, nothing note - worthy.[SEP]front desk staff were nice and check - in and check - out were relatively easy.
1	we bought a great package through living social.[SEP]the staff at napa river inn made this birthday trip an exceptional one.[SEP]the hotel is in a wonderful location and allows visitors to easily walk around downtown comfortably.[SEP]the staff was very accommodating and the concierge, laurie, was extremely helpful.[SEP]we would definitely recommend this place to friends and family.
1	good location and spacious and clean room good location, within walking distance to ala moana centre (for shopping and dining) and lagoon / beach.[SEP]bus stop nearby to chinatown (more dining) and pearl harbor.[SEP]large and clean room with two double comfortable beds.[SEP]free internet (with own laptop) and free in - room safe.[SEP]friendly and helpful front desk.[SEP]no privacy from windows so kept shutter closed at all times.[SEP]only one elevator and housekeeping tended to hold it for a long time.[SEP]stairs to front lobby from street level poses problems with carrying heavy luggage.
1	if you are coming to san francisco and you need nice, inexpensive accommodations, especially if you are driving, look no further than the cow hollow motor inn.[SEP]i found the property to the credit of good tripadvisor reviews, and i was not let down.[SEP]for a room in san francisco under $100, the rooms are clean, comfy and nicely appointed.[SEP]and oh yeah, the parking is free.[SEP]the folks at the front desk and pleasant and accommodating and the location is in the heart of the bustling marina district.[SEP]steps out of the hotel entrance on steiner street are at least a dozen great little restaurants ranging from steak to sushi to organic vegetarian.[SEP]you're a block away from the shops on chestnut street and three blocks from the shops on union street.[SEP]and of course, the hotel is located on lombard street, so you are a fairly quick drive to any part of the city.[SEP]the only downside is that the rooms that face lombard street can be a bit noisy with all the traffic, but hey, that's part of the charm of san francisco!
1	my partner and i have traveled to s.f. serveral times this past year.[SEP]we just happened to find hotel tomo by accident.[SEP]we have both said we would never stay anywhere else.[SEP]we love the location, japan town is right at your front door.[SEP]all the shopping and restauraunts you could want.[SEP]the fillmore is also a hop skip and a jump.[SEP]they have excellent bars, and shops as well.[SEP]what i really like about hotel tomo is the staff.[SEP]they are always friendly and are genuinely interested in making your stay a good one.[SEP]they even remember me when i call to make my reservation.[SEP]i reccomend tomo to all my friends who are going to san francisco.
1	this is a lovely, classic hotel.[SEP]the lobby is beautiful and makes a great first impression.[SEP]the staff were friendly and offered advice and information when asked.[SEP]the rooms a huge and although a little dated in terms of mod cons it was just what we needed.[SEP]the best thing about the hotel is definitely it's location.[SEP]you can see the empire state from the doorstep and it's just 2 blocks up 5th avenue.[SEP]would definitely stay again.
1	the tower 23 hotel in san diego (pacific beach) was perfect.[SEP]it's very modern / sleek.[SEP]everyone in the hotel was very helpful and very friendly.[SEP]the rooms were great, the " tower deck " was the greatest - a quiet place to watch the surfers, sunsets and everyone on the beach.[SEP]they even serve drinks and food on the deck.[SEP]had planned to do some sightseeing, but ended up on the tower deck every afternoon.[SEP]it's a great location, lots of shops and restaurants nearby.[SEP]very relaxing.....[SEP]i'd go back in a hearbeat!
1	this hotel is very well located, just a few steps from the bus station and close to a metro station.[SEP]despite its location, where two of the busiest avenues converge, the hotel is extremely quiet.[SEP]the entire staff are extremely courteous and seem very knowledgable.[SEP]at all times, there was somebody willing to assist with a big smile.[SEP]the front desk staff, bell boys, room service and restaurant staff, they all where fantastic, met every one of our very demanding needs and treated our children like super stars.[SEP]the food is very good and reasonable priced for a hotel.[SEP]we never had to ask twice for things to happen, it seems that the gm has a very well organized and trained team.[SEP]kudos to all!
1	absolutely would recommend this hotel to friends and family.[SEP]location is fantastic, and the staff are so attentive, and provide excellent customer service.[SEP]the buffet breakfast is amazing so many choices and the buffet evening meal was also fantastic, make sure you book or you could have a long wait as its so popular.[SEP]on the downside i would have liked to have been informed by reception about the club lounge to have had the opportunity to upgrade.[SEP]great having both nespresso machine and tea making facilities in room.[SEP]the free mini bar provided beer, coke, water and orange as well a a biscuit.[SEP]on the downside, the hairdryer was annoying, the cord did not stretch very much and as a result kept coming out of the wall.
1	this hotel is a gem in downtown toronto.[SEP]it's quiet yet there's clubs if you want (the closing time in canada is pretty early for bars at least), there're shops nearby but it's not in the middle of a mecca, and if you're looking to visit the cn tower this is an ideal location for a 5 minute walk.[SEP]granted it's not in the' trendy' (i.e expensive) or shopping districts of toronto but it's a stones throw away.... and means there's not loads of people walking around at all times.[SEP]it's very very handy to the train station and all the local / tourist bus routes.[SEP]the hotel looks a bit rough around the edges from the outside, but the inside is great.[SEP]and truthfully, we'd all rather it looked rough outside a hotel than inside it![SEP]the rooms are small but they have air conditioning - a bit noisy but nothing to fret over and they are extremely clean, with maid service daily.[SEP]plus they're very tastefully decorated![SEP]finally, the staff are extremely friendly.[SEP]it doesn't matter what time of night / day it is, or how stupid the question is - they've got the answers![SEP]i know we all say this, but if i'm ever in toronto again i'll stay here.
1	i went to this hotel because of the reviews on tripadvisor and was not disappointed.[SEP]it is in a perfect location and has an entrance right into the orlando mall.[SEP]the rooms were great, clean and very big and the king bed was very comfortable.[SEP]the place must be good as all of the virgin cabin crew stay there![SEP]they also have a direct link to orlando's airport info so you can see if your flight is on time / delayed etc.[SEP]really good place - would recommend for all who don't want to be on top of the resorts as they were all within reasonable driving distance.
1	first of all, book a superior room, which doesn't cost that much.[SEP]we always pay 200 $when we visit for one night.[SEP]we get a king sized bed for 3 people, which is perfect.[SEP]we even have room for two pillows between each other.[SEP]they really have a good breakfast and their cheese pizza is to die for.[SEP]the poutine is also very good and so is their cesar salad.[SEP]basically, everything they have to eat is good.[SEP]the service itself is good.[SEP]we got there earlier than usual one time and we had no problem leaving our bags in the room.[SEP]the location is very convenient also, because they have a metro stop, right under the hotel.[SEP]you can access it by the restaurant, which is pretty cool.[SEP]the pool is such a fun place to be.[SEP]it's located up high, so you get a nice view of montreal.[SEP]all in all, this hotel is my first choice.
1	this hotel offers many ammenities that qualifies for as a resort hotel.[SEP]it is a mid - scale hotel and seems to deliver at that level.[SEP]the location on the beach is very convenient.[SEP]the hotel also offers two pools, outdoor bar and grill, and indoor restraurants.[SEP]the staff were always helpful and friendly (a rarity for the mid - atlantic).[SEP]i thought the house keeping staff also did their job well and seemed pleasant.[SEP]it seemed to me that there was good management and happy staff.[SEP]this translated into a good stay.[SEP]as far as areas that would be " nice to haves " in improvement: i think the rooms could be updated.[SEP]it is probably time for an update although i point out that everything was clean and in working order.[SEP]i thought the beach grill was a bit expensive for the quanity / quality, but i do realize the convenience price.[SEP]location -- not much within a 2 - 3 blocks north or south that would be convenient to run out.[SEP]you are car dependent to access the rest of oc.[SEP]overall, i think it was a good mid - scale hotel.[SEP]i would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for the mid - scale price and services resort.
1	this hotel is perfect, if your not too fussy.[SEP]the good thing about this hotel is the location.[SEP]it is just across the road from leidseplein area, which lots of busy bars, etc.[SEP]also the hotel is a 5 min walk from vondelpark, 10 mins walk to van gogh museum.[SEP]from leidseplein to centraal station you can take the trams no.[SEP]1,2 & 5.[SEP]also tram no.[SEP]10 takes you to brouwerij lj windmill brewery (a must if you like beer!!) the room it " cosy " but clean, and would suit people who travel light or are ok living out of a suitcase.[SEP]it can get a bit noisy at times, but if your in amsterdam you won't be spend much time in your room![SEP]staff are friendly, not sure what the breakfast was like, it seemed a bit expensive 15 euro for cont breakfast.[SEP]there is a nice little supermarket around the corner, which sell lovely breads, fruits, cheeses, meats, etc.[SEP]so we had breakfast' al fresco' in vondelpark every morning.
1	we stayed for seven nights, march 12 through 19, 2009.[SEP]what a great place.[SEP]truly, the staff of this hotel is the friendliest, most helpful and delightful.[SEP]catherine and madame fã © lix went out of their way to make our stay comfortable and just plain fun.[SEP]the hotel is situated on a very busy intersection, but the place is very well sound proofed and we were not bothered in the least by traffic noise.[SEP]there is a metro entrance twenty - five feet from the front door and a the montparnasse â€ ” bienvenã¼e station, a major rail - bus - metro hub, is a five minute walk.[SEP]you can get to anyplace in metropolitan paris in twenty minutes.[SEP]good, inexpensive food is all around the place.[SEP]bottom line: great value, great location and the best staff.[SEP]don't tell anyone about this place.[SEP]please!
1	stayed here for my first trip to berlin with my wife and 3 year old son ben.[SEP]hard to find any faults.[SEP]arrived late at night so it was not until next morning that i realised just how clean and spotless rooms were.[SEP]nhs cleaners should be sent here for lessons.[SEP]breakfast was magnificant for continental buffet.[SEP]staff were extremly pleasant and very child friendly.[SEP]location excellent.[SEP]only fault i could find was the pillows were a bit thin for my liking but after a day walking around berlin i had no trouble sleeping.[SEP]excellent value
1	we stayed here for three days and it was as good as the other reviews suggest.[SEP]the room (delux) was very spacious and the bathroom was fantastic.[SEP]the pics, candid and on the hotel web site, are exactly what you get.[SEP]no unpleasant surprises.[SEP]the staff are the best i have encountered, extremely polite and will do anything to help.[SEP]the hotel is in a great location with lots to see and do within a short walk.[SEP]go to the zoo, a 5 min walk away, it's a great day out.[SEP]would i go again?[SEP]without any doubt at all.
1	the hotel was clean and the staff very pleasant.[SEP]they have a luggage room to give you some wiggle room to do some things out in the city just before and after check in / out.[SEP]the room was ready hours before check in time.[SEP]the hotel is on west 32nd, in koreatown, with a dozen great korean restaurants doors away.[SEP]it is 5 or so minutes walk from penn station and every transport option you'd need.[SEP]all that being true, the room was uncomfortably hot all night, with no air flow and no adjustment possible.[SEP]i heard others complain at the desk.[SEP]they give minimal towels (one wash cloth for two people?) and there is no little coffee maker in the room.[SEP]rooms are small but have a closet and an adequate bathroom.[SEP]seemed rather sparce and heating outdated.[SEP]for 225 a night, i didn't feel i got a good deal at all.[SEP]overall not terrible, good location.[SEP]there are other hotels on the street i'd check out first next time.
1	a great apartment hotel.[SEP]the apartment includes a fully equipped kitchen and even a washer and dryer in the bathroom.[SEP]best of all is the location.[SEP]it is one block from darling harbour, across the street from the aquarium and about a ten minute walk to chinatown and to george st.[SEP]with all the best shopping.
1	we were somewhat hesitant to book at ti over aria or mandalay, but given the combo of great strip location + great deal, we went ahead and rolled the dice.[SEP]we were very pleased with our choice.[SEP]as mentioned elsewhere, the rooms are updated and we found both the rooms and the corridors very clean.[SEP]mattress was surprisingly comfortable.[SEP]we stayed at paris recently and the ti room was in much better shape than a similar room at paris.[SEP]neither check - in nor check - out entailed a long line.[SEP]others mention the smoke in the casino.[SEP]yeah, it's bad (as is the gross air freshener they pump in).[SEP]my allergies went wild.[SEP]had that smell at all permeated the room, we would've checked out immediately, but the air quality in the room was just fine.[SEP]i coped by rushing through the casino to and from the elevator -- a minor inconvenience, but worth it given the value.[SEP]my husband and i would not hesitate to book again.
1	we went to the hotel for four nights on easter, the staff at the reception desk was professional and helpful but unfortunately the rooms were not as good.[SEP]we stayed in two different rooms, the first one was quite big but seemed the walls were made of paper!![SEP]we could hear the phone, alarms and conversations in other rooms as if they were happening in ours.[SEP]after a few days traveling traveling around turkey we went back to the hotel for the last night, (had already booked it and didn't have time to look for a different accommodation).[SEP]we were given a different room, which was not very clean, (mould in the shower, paint & plaster falling off the wall), and had quite an unconfortable bed.[SEP]the location was good, 5 minutes away from the cemberlitas tram stop, and 10/15 min away from the main views in sultanahmet, but there are many hotels on the area and would definitely try another if i went back...
1	rooms: one of the best i have ever seen.[SEP]it is huge and nicely done up.[SEP]the bed is extremely comfortable with good quality bed linen.[SEP]in the bathroom, there is a huge bathtub with a tv in it.[SEP]plenty of good quality towels available as well.[SEP]cleanliness: very clean![SEP]excellent house - keeping service.[SEP]location: directly across the road from fashion show mall.[SEP]it may not be in the centre of the strip, but with a car, it is easy to get around.[SEP]service: generally good service from reception to cleaners.[SEP]value: for the price i have paid, i think this is very good value for such a fine hotel.[SEP]while parking is free (free for most hotels in las vegas), internet costs $13 plus per 24 hour block.[SEP]food and drinks in room are expensive too.[SEP]a luxurious hotel on the strip, this is one hotel that i will miss.
1	we already had high expectations about this hotel from other reviews here at tripadvisor, but we were still amazed that everything is true or even better.[SEP]the most effective and very pleasant staff, beautiful room, high - quality bed, quiet sleep and excellent breakfast, what more one can wish on the trip to paris?[SEP]the hotel location is great, plenty of restaurants in walking distance, subway practically in front of the hotel, but still the hotel is hidden in the side street and with good windows its rooms are very quiet.[SEP]breakfast was also superb, e.g. the wide choice of excellent juices is unusual.[SEP]however, our best experience remains with the hotel staff - everyone was always nice and ready to help, and all our requests were promptly fulfilled.[SEP]we can really recommend this hotel to anyone, you will not regret...
1	we stayed for one night on 28th september before going on a cruise.[SEP]the room was a little small but very well appointed.[SEP]the facilities were very good but the best part for us was the staff who went out of their way to help us with everything that we needed.[SEP]the location was also superb and meant that we were able to do a lot of sight seeing in a very limited time.[SEP]we didn't have time to make use of the pool area or restaurant but would like to stay again so that we could sample both.
1	recently spent 2 nights at hotel de rome, berlin with my husband who was on a business trip.[SEP]it had only been open 6 weeks and so there were some minor teething troubles such as the tv internet facilities not working.[SEP]bedroom very comfortable but the duvet was heavy and it was too hot to sleep - there were no alternative bed coverings available.[SEP]also the pillows whilst being of the highest quality were too thick for my liking.[SEP]the aircon was difficult to work out as there were no temperature markings and it was not possible to open the window only a little.[SEP]the bathroom was very luxurious but the towels did not smell that fresh.[SEP]the decor of the hotel is minimalist and beautifully colour coordinated.[SEP]we had dinner in the dining room with guests and although the' italian' food was of a very high standard, we were surprised to be charge over 80 euros for 7 bottles of mineral water![SEP]breakfast is charged extra and you can help yourself from the buffet for 19 euros or have cooked stuff as well for 26 euros.[SEP]fantastic buffet of best quality cheese, meat, salmon, breads, cakes, fresh berries, cereals, juices etc.[SEP]we did not use the spa but the water in the pool was warm.[SEP]good location in beautiful building with helpful staff.
1	stayed 3 nights (wed - sat) as part of our usa honeymoon and overall we loved our stay at the solamar.[SEP]pros: great location in the heart of trendy gaslamp district - great food and drinking options and all major shops within short stroll.[SEP]great evening buzz in the area in the evenings and feels safe.[SEP]also very conveient base to explore san diego by car as we found it very easy to drive to both the beaches and inland areas.[SEP]smart decor and furnishings.[SEP]room was probably the largest we had through our entire usa adventure.[SEP]extremely comfortable bed, flatscreen tv and ipod dock etc.[SEP]great bathroom and good toiletries.[SEP]we had a delux room, on 7th floor, overlooking the pool.[SEP]nice view.[SEP]free coffee in the mornings, juice in the afternoon and wine / sangria between 5 - 6 with small canapes on offer.[SEP]friendly and helpful staff at front desk and in the lobby.[SEP]nice american breakfast each day in the restaurant.[SEP]great rooftop pool for relaxation with bar and food available as required cons: valet parking at $35 a day - however, there are cheaper options if you can be bothered looking around.[SEP]occasional music from rooftop bar till 10 pm occasional conventions on around the pool area which can be noisy and take away the' relaxed' feel needed when sunbathing around the pool.[SEP]overall, we would definately stay at the solamar again when we return/
1	my husband and i visited new york in january to attend a prince concert at madison square garden.[SEP]this hotel suited our needs perfectly.[SEP]it was reasonably priced, only a block from msg, and had easy access to every place in nyc we wanted to visit.[SEP]we could walk to times square, and several subway stations were closeby.[SEP]taxis were also cheap, and the front desk was always happy to arrange for a cab to be waiting for us by the front door when we came downstairs.[SEP]our room was very comfortable and nicely appointed, with a king bed, comfortable bedding, and modern bathroom.[SEP]the hot breakfast was impressively varied and supplied us plenty of energy every morning to play around town.[SEP]we would definitely stay here again, especially if we are attending another concert at msg.[SEP]this hotel is a fantastic value, considering the price, location, and quality of our stay.
1	all the glowing reviews are right.[SEP]clean, quiet, can't beat the location: all true.[SEP]one review said it was " too small ".[SEP]i am 6'6 ", my wife is 6 feet even, and my two sons are 6'7 ", and 6'5 ".[SEP]i know what " too small " means.[SEP]i got a room with 9 foot ceilings, 2 queen beds, and a strangely comfortable hide - a - bed, and an auxilliary bathroom sink(outside the bathroom) on the 6th floor for $200 a night.[SEP]the room was not advertised on thier website, but i simply asked, and was pleasantly surprised.[SEP]don't miss cosmo's daily news (bodega style convenience store) outside on the ground floor.[SEP]we ate a quick breakfast there, almost every day we were there.[SEP]also, there is excellent italian, chinese, and indian food, all within walking distance of the hotel.
1	hmm... how to desribe this hotel?[SEP]the only good point is the excellent location, situated one minute away from times square.[SEP]this can be only reason why this hotel has been allowed to stay open.[SEP]we were greeted on our arival by a cleaner sitting on our bed smoking and watching tv.[SEP]the door to our room did not lock properly and could easily be opened by anyone applying force.[SEP]every morning our bathroom was soaked as the bathroom from the room above us leaked into ours.[SEP]on one of the days of our trip my boyfriend was offered heroin while we entered the hotel!!!!!!![SEP]also we were awoken one night by sex orgy going on which probably involved the prositutes that line up outside the hotel (in front of the xxx rated porn shops located next to the hotel) if all this does not convince you to not stay here then maybe the fact that we had mice / rats in our room will help change your decision!!!!![SEP]this is a disgusting hotel, thank god new york is so amazing otherwise this trip would have been a complete disaster.[SEP]please note we are not people who come on these sites to moan about eveywhere we have been and are not high maintenance, this hotel really is this bad!
1	we were on a work related trip in amsterdam and stayed at this hotel.[SEP]the location is ideal.[SEP]rijksmuseum just next by and the tram station just around the corner.[SEP]if you're not afraid to walk a bit the shopping streets are just 20 minutes away and there's lots to see on the way there.[SEP]and great restaurants.[SEP]i was fortunate to get a room all to myself.[SEP]i stayed in the sixth floor at the corner suite.[SEP]a superb room, king size bed, two rooms, a huge bath room.[SEP]the breakfest was also great and the staff reasonably nice.[SEP]the hotel does deserve the four stars!!
1	a fine hotel in a great midtown location.[SEP]for those who always complain about the room sizes in ny, i recommend the enormous king size room for a few dollars more - well worth it.[SEP]my room faced the back - no view but very quiet - a must for nyc.[SEP]i loved the room ambiance with strategically located blue lighting for a serene atmosphere.[SEP]nice touch.[SEP]as for the rest, a most decent hotel with a fine connecting italian restaurant.[SEP]clean rooms, efficient service - everything you'd expect at this level.
1	airport hotels are not somewhere you normally choose to be - they are more of a necessity.[SEP]the crowne plaza is in an excellent location, attached to terminal 3 (so no transfer bus to wait hours for).[SEP]the rooms are well designed - one feature i did like was the sofa at the end of the bed, directly opposite the tv - great when you don't want to lie on the bed to watch a programme (most hotels don't seem to get this option right).[SEP]the bathroom is large, with a separate shower and natural daylight.[SEP]there are good blackout curtains and the hotel seems to have a strong eco - policy, which is nice to see.[SEP]i had access to the club lounge, which was nice, but probably not necessary for a one night stay.[SEP]there is a lovely pool - plenty of space for both laps and to cool off.[SEP]i did not get to experience the restaurants & bars - but they looked ok (you also have access to restaurants in the terminal, for additional choice).[SEP]getting into the city is quick and reasonably priced in a taxi.[SEP]service is minimal - but friendly and efficient.
1	have been to nyc 7 time already since 2004 and have stayed in pennsylvannia hotel everytime the hotel is clean and staff are friendly.[SEP]the hotel is in a great location right accross from madison square gardens and macys is on the corner.[SEP]empire state building is behind you and time square and 5th avenue are 10 mins away.[SEP]you could'nt pick a better hotel unless like paris hilton your loaded.[SEP]never had any complaints about the hotel there cleaned everyday would'nt pay money for brand hotels as they are all the same and i could think of better things to spend the money on when all you do is sleep in the room as your always out.[SEP]all in all its a great hotel great location would reccomend to anyone.[SEP]+ + + + + + + + + +
1	stayed at the w for a two day meeting at the hotel.[SEP]the hotel has been well described here.[SEP]it is very trendy - aiming for the young / hip crowd.[SEP]the lobby bar and lobby are in general are very nice.[SEP]all of the staff was very pleasant.[SEP]the valet's hold the door when you go in, front desk and concierge greet you.[SEP]housekeeping is very pleasant.[SEP]being a relatively cold december week (mid 50's), the rooftop bar and lobby bar were not all that busy, and noise was not a problem.[SEP]the rooms are interesting.[SEP]i really liked the window seat even if my view was of the parking lot and the occasional trolley going by.[SEP]the bed was very comfortable.[SEP]i do agree that the somewhat strange shower, while very nice, ends up soaking the whole bathroom.[SEP]also, other than the window seat and a desk chair, there was no other seating in my room.[SEP]i did have a minor problem with my remote not working, but it was quickly replaced even around 10 o'clock at night.[SEP]others things i wasn't a big fan of was the $14.95 internet charge ($10 or so is ok, but $15), and the $2.00 charge to make an 800 call.[SEP]these were both minor issues, but irritating.[SEP]on the plus side, this hotel is in a great location near the gaslight district, the train station, harbor, and trolley lines.
1	this hotel exudes paris chic and style.[SEP]the hotel is not furnished in a grand way rather it is classically modern, decorated in lovely calming colours.[SEP]the location is ideal, close to all the major attractions, but set in a ritzy part of the city surrounded by many fine restaurants.[SEP]the service in the hotel is fast, efficient and polite, without being invasive.[SEP]our room was on the top floor at the rear of the hotel.[SEP]we could not believe our luck as we had uninterrupted views of the eiffel tower.[SEP]the compromise is the low roof space, being an attic style room.[SEP]the breakfasts had all the usual fair, but were of consistently high quality.[SEP]i would definitely stay here again.
1	my husband, 18 year old daughter, and i stayed here at the end of august.[SEP]we had a corner urban suite on the first floor.[SEP]everything was excellent - location, service, cleanliness, bedding, buffet breakfast etc... the only problem we had was with noise from partying locals on friday and saturday night.[SEP]the fact that they give you earplugs at turndown should have been our first clue.[SEP]however since it was our first stop in spain and we enjoy experiencing the local culture we used our earplugs and had no problem with it.[SEP]i would defintely stay there again.
1	the day before i arrived, i called ahead to ask the manager to save 2 rooms close together for my friend and me.[SEP]he took my name and number and said he would call right back, he never did.[SEP]my room was so small i thought it was a joke.[SEP]there was no closet, but hangers on the lamp.[SEP]eventually i was " upgraded ", and i use that term loosely.[SEP]this room was right over the nightclub.[SEP]five stories up and it felt like the band was in the room.[SEP]i kept checking to see if the window was open it was so loud.[SEP]there was no ny or london times, or l'occitane products as advertised.[SEP]the towels were threadbare and looked like something you'd see at the y.[SEP]the elevators were very slow.[SEP]the location was good, and some of the staff did try.[SEP]but for the price, i would stay elsewhere.
1	chic hotel with friendly staff.[SEP]trendy looking lobby.[SEP]excellent location for boutique shopping and plenty of small restaurants around.[SEP]subway stop is 5 minutes walk away.[SEP]free wifi is always a good sign (and should really be the standard nowadays).[SEP]however, it lounge / club (located next to the lobby) can get pretty noisy over the weekend.[SEP]we staid at the 7th floor and yet i was woken up by the rowdy clubbing crowd on the street with noises of glass shattering and constant car - honking.[SEP]this may very well be an one - off incident however.[SEP]side note: tricky toilet.[SEP]either i am stupid or need operating instruction.:-) i recommend this hotel for a nice couple getaway or singles looking for a good time to spend over the weekend.[SEP]definitely a nice refreshing change from those hotels at the tiring tourist area, e.g. time sq.
1	my girlfriend and i wanted to stop by calistoga but with no location in mind.[SEP]after making several calls to hotels, roman spa gave us the best deal.[SEP]the room was large and comfortable, and came with a small kitchen corner which is great for a 2 - 3 day stay.[SEP]the bathroom is clean as well.[SEP]service is great.[SEP]there are swimming pools: an outdoor and an indoor (and a sauna).[SEP]the water is treated with special methods as it is mineral water.[SEP]it is in the heart of calistoga's main restaurants, galleries, and bars.[SEP]would stop by here again.
1	hey there.[SEP]i stayed at the rideau motor inn in august 2012 with my gma, aunt and two lil kids and myself.[SEP]we did know there is nt an elevator so i made sure to book on the first floor.[SEP]you still had to walk up a bunch of steps but the view is amazing and its worth the money..[SEP]the room was nt anything special but it was clean.[SEP]and very big..[SEP]its an older place so i was nt looking for a million dollar room but the view was a million dollar view.[SEP]ocean city hosted a laser lights show that i could see from the balcony so i did nt have to fight the crowd down below.[SEP]and its in prime location.[SEP]the pool was always very nice and clean and we were in it every day.[SEP]you ca nt beat the location..[SEP]it was nt a bad hotel.[SEP]if your looking for a nice clean place stay here.[SEP]if you are looking for an expensive hotel with all new everything then i d recommend going somewhere else.[SEP]but i enjoyed it and will stay here again.
1	my husband and i stayed for a weekend to enjoy london.[SEP]after booking on lastminute.com under the secret hotels section " unbelievable offer at a hotel in piccadilly - 5 * - london.[SEP]overlooking green park, this first class hotel is only a short stroll away from buckingham palace ", we were extremely dissapointed.[SEP]the room was so old fashioned, especially the bathroon (the floor and wall tiles were something out of the 1970's).[SEP]how this hotel can call itself 5 star is beyond me... more like 2 star (and that's being kind!).[SEP]the only points that redeem it is it's location (over looking green park - the rooms don't), it was clean and the bar / cream teas area was very stylish (to lure you in!) but don't be fooled.[SEP]do not waste your money on this hotel.
1	just like the reviews having read all the reviews for this hotel, we were worried that it couldn't be as good or as cost effective as it sounded.[SEP]it was![SEP]we stayed from 24 - 27 feb and had a pleasant stay.[SEP]our room was a good size, comfortable beds and spotlessly clean.[SEP]the staff were all helpful and friendly.[SEP]the subway was close by so it didn't matter that it wasn't right next to times square, and we prefered the quieter location.[SEP]we enjoyed the breakfast buffet with freshly cooked waffles and omelets.[SEP]if you are looking for a hotel with a really large lobby area, lots of lounges and fancy bars etc etc, this is probably not the hotel for you, although there is a small sitting area with computers etc upstairs.[SEP]we would definitely stay here on our next trip to new york
1	this is our second stay at the hotel rex, and this time friends joined us from socal and we asked that we have a room on the same floor.[SEP]the rex is like staying with family.[SEP]they are wonderful hosts, looking to fulfill every need before you express it.[SEP]the hotel itself is grand, and the location is perfect for all your needs.[SEP]we've stayed at at the wharf and on russian hill, and really, the rex has the best location, value, and attitude.
1	we stayed here in early april for 5 nights and were very pleased with the location and standard of accommodation - we definitely think we had good value for money.[SEP]walking to times square is quick and easy and an underground station is nearby too.[SEP]the breakfast area is busy but we didn't wait long for a table.[SEP]staff top up the food regularly and there is an ample choice including cereals, yogurts, muffins / bagels etc.[SEP]coffee and tea is available throughout the day, you just help yourself from the breakfast area.[SEP]we would definitely stay here again and would recommend the hotel to friends.
1	amazing![SEP]we stayed at the resortquest waikiki beach hotel for 5 nights from 23rd september 2006.[SEP]the room was great with an amazing view of the beach and ocean.[SEP]the location was perfect.[SEP]we were sad to leave and would definitely stay there again.[SEP]the breakfast on the beach idea is genius!
1	i had a chance to stay six nights at the jw marriott on a business trip.[SEP]i brought my wife along.[SEP]it was very luxurious.[SEP]the room was somewhat smaller, but apparently standard for a hong kong hotel.[SEP]the view was nice and the location is very central with easy access to the mtr.[SEP]my wife used their spa and enjoyed it very much.[SEP]the most memorable thing for me was the breakfast buffet each morning at the marriott cafe.[SEP]we opted to include it as a daily option when we booked.[SEP]a bit more expensive, but it was worth it.
1	after reading multiple reviews regarding rats and rude staff, i was prepared for the worst.[SEP]fortunately the stay was nothing but the opposite.[SEP]the location was easy to get to and perfectly located near the subway, empire state building and macy's.[SEP]check - in was friendly and easy.[SEP]the rooms were dated and only slightly noisy from outside honking.[SEP]linens were clean.[SEP]the bathroom was small but adequate.[SEP]the breakfast was the best part of the stay - nuts, dried fruit, bagels, doughnuts, muffins, fresh fruit, red bull, yogurt, etc.[SEP]it was over the top and very satisfying.[SEP]the hotel lobby and stoop were consistenly full like a hostel - lots of folks about.[SEP]my friend used her lq points for the stay ; not sure that i would pay to stay here but it was not at all like the reviews i had read.[SEP]the property is only 4 - 5 doors down from pinkberry - a great frozen yogurt shop.[SEP]highly recommended!
1	we stayed here for 5 nights as a first wedding anniversary trip.[SEP]the location is good and the room was sizeable enough but attention to detail needs improving - there was a broken light in the bathroom and the phone wasn't working.[SEP]the staff here were not helpful or pleasant.[SEP]when we checked in the first thing we were told was that they had better rooms to upgrade to.[SEP]i thought great, perhaps they will be nice given it is our wedding anniversary, but of course, they simply want to charge an extra $75 a night to do so which on top of what we had already paid was not worth it.[SEP]i wonder if we had upgraded whether the service would have been more personable but i doubt it.[SEP]they were not accommodating to us for a late check out and the concierge was patronizing in his response about transportation to the airport.[SEP]i recognise in big cities like new york you don't get the same level of service, but is it really too much to ask for to feel like your custom is worth it, particularly in today's economy.[SEP]disappointing but didn't put a dampner on our trip.
1	the chelsea hotel is just not for every one.[SEP]the people working there are all toughies and the place is like an apartment building more then a hotel.[SEP]we changed 2 rooms in 4 days mainly because the evening staff does not know what the morning staff is doing or saying.[SEP]people are not very friendly and they keep you in line, reminding you with the tone of voice or the body language (mostly big tall guys work there, only 1 woman and they have no name taggs) that you are " the guest " we did get back into the new york toughness of people dealing with each other while staying there.[SEP]the rooms are very different, some with new bathrooms, but old mattress, some with outside bathroom from the 1950's but the bed was good, the towels were changes dayly and were plenty.[SEP]the paint or furniture is not even worth discussing, very " basic " and old, the wall to wall carpet is old and not so clean, to say the least.[SEP]the location is very good, many famous people lived there and still do- you feel like you live in ny because the area is mostly residential with lots of stores, flower shops, diners, restaurants and the subway (line 1) is just around the corner.[SEP]the price is also cheap compared to the other places in nyc, check your bill carefully when you check out..........
1	my husband and i stayed at the roosevelt for 3 nights in march and we had a very pleasant experience.[SEP]i was a little leery after reading some of the reviews here, but i was pleasantly surprised.[SEP]check in was easy, the hotel held our luggage until our rooms were ready.[SEP]we were on the fifth floor and our room was more than adequate.[SEP]yes, it is a small room, but you are in new york.[SEP]i don't expect to spend much time in there anyway.[SEP]the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was thoroughly clean.[SEP]the only negative thing i can say was that the walls are pretty thin (you can hear people in the hallway) and the fan / heater was very loud, but i actually like white noise so it wasn't too much of a problem and it actually drowned out the noise from the hallway.[SEP]also wifi was not free, however we found that there was a glitch and we could sometimes log on for free for a few minutes each day.[SEP]you can not beat the location of this hotel.[SEP]we were very central to everything and that made it easy to drop things off at the hotel midday, or later on find great restaurants to eat at.[SEP]if you can get a great rate on priceline, this is very good value hotel.
1	i have stayed at st marks twice before and have just got back for the third time![SEP]the staff were polite and extremely helpful.[SEP]our rooms were beautifully cleaned daily!!![SEP]location is amazing!!![SEP]i left my handbag in a cab with money and passport and the desk staff could not have been more helpful.[SEP]yes the hotel has no frills but is wonderful!!!![SEP]i ordered a taxi at the desk to jfk which they advised would be $55 + tips!!![SEP]that was fine as its only the yellow cabs that are $45!!![SEP]thank you again for an amazing, clean and wonderful time!!!!![SEP]definitely a truly authentic nyc experience!!!![SEP]i got my handbag back with everything in it even the $300!!!![SEP]this would be unlikely in the uk.... keep up the work st marks........
1	nice location.[SEP]unpleasant staff.[SEP]rooms overlooking the street, very noisy.[SEP]rooms look like an old furniture's depot.[SEP]breakfast was ridiculously poor.[SEP]in sum, this is an overpriced b&b.
1	me and my wife join my daughter for a one day stay at this hotel.[SEP]stay was both a business stay and family trip.[SEP]check - in was fast.[SEP]room was excellent with a view of the harbor.[SEP]hotel room was above average and room service was fast with great food.[SEP]i must note staff was very frendly and helpful.[SEP]hotel location is outstanding since was near the seaport village with its gift shops and restaurants.[SEP]it also provided access to the boardwalk and a ten minute walk to the uss midway museum.[SEP]land transportation such as the trolley is across the street.[SEP]i may mention you may hear as passing train which may effect you if you are a light sleeper so request a room so you do not hear the train going by.[SEP]future vacations plans will include a longer stay at this hotel.
1	highly recommend.[SEP]hotel staff was pleasant, courteous, and accomodating.[SEP]rooms and the hotel - clean.[SEP]it was a last minute plan to travel to n.y.c. for 3 vacation days.[SEP]someone recommended to my husband that they stay at the red roof inn and are very pleased every time they go there.[SEP]it was a very good experience for our family of four.[SEP]we arrived 2 hours before check - in time just hoping the staff would hold our luggage and direct us where to park our car.[SEP]to our surprise our room was available and they brought our luggage up to our room immediately.[SEP]wow![SEP]we reserved a 2 double bed room.[SEP]the room had limited area to walk, but that was fine.[SEP]bathroom good size.[SEP]free wifi and my kids loved using their i touch.[SEP]also, the location of the red roof inn was very convenient to everything.[SEP]great location![SEP]my children enjoyed having their late night snack at pinkberry(yogurt shop) which is across the street.[SEP]a perfect healthy snack to end the day..[SEP]and the hotel also provides a continental breakfast each morning.[SEP]the selection ranged from bagels, cereal, yogurt, donuts, juice and weak coffee.
1	good value for money as it was the cheapest hotel we could find in new york.[SEP]the location is perfect, we walked to all the sights both night and day.[SEP]shared bathroom wasn't ideal but never had to queue.[SEP]quite liked the old style of the hotel.[SEP]overall good budget stay.
1	the receptionist was very friendly and very helpful.[SEP]the hotel was modern, the rooms were not very spacious but we did nt spend that much time in the rooms.[SEP]the lounge / bar was very comfortable, my only complaint was the rude bar tender who always seemed he had something better to do than take our order.[SEP]ac was very strong which was much needed coz we went during a heatwave.[SEP]the location was excellent.[SEP]the coridoors had hardwood floors which might have woken you up if people were moving suitcases.[SEP]also the bar downstairs is in the hotel and it could get a bit noisy especially on the weekends but it was tolerable.
1	classic hilton service, nice location you'll find everything you should expect from a hilton.[SEP]great service, perfectly clean, and the location is excellent, a block from chinatown and great restaurants, 4 blocks from a cable car stop.[SEP]the only bad point is for parking.[SEP]valet parking is $47 a day, which is bordering on absurd.[SEP]i parked the car myself in the same lot the second day for $25.[SEP]they did charge me for 2 days of valet parking, but corrected the bill without any question.[SEP]i didn't fond the rooms to be so small.[SEP]every room seems to have a great view.[SEP]i had a great deal of $79 with priceline, and that's unbeatable for sf.
1	my wife and i came here for one night.[SEP]if you have only one night in seattle and you want an awesome location so that you can maximize your time here, this is the best choice.[SEP]they also have a very nice rooftop patio which has a fairly amazing (and often private) view of the bay.[SEP]the room is quite good - clean, good mattresses and what you'd expect from a decent hotel.[SEP]i should note that the rooms on the street side are probably a bit noiser than the ocean view rooms (due to the folks wandering the street at night), but we still had a great time.[SEP]recommended!
1	just got back from a fantastic holiday.[SEP]this hotel is in a great location for seaworld and the new aquatica waterpark.[SEP]its only 8 - 10 minutes from all other parks.[SEP]as previously said this hotel has recently been refurbed and the layout is fantastic.[SEP]pool facilities were great - also had volleyball, tennis, table tennis etc.[SEP]etc.[SEP]rooms were really big which meant a family had succificient room.[SEP]and included a safe and fridge with no restrictions on placing your own drinks / food in them.[SEP]we also had a turn down service each evening with chocolates left on bed and weather details for following day.[SEP]by booking with virgin we received free self parking and also holiding a frequent flyer card you receive 10% in bars / restaurants.[SEP]staff in starbucks were very pleasant each morning we arrived for our morning fix of latte / hot chocolate.[SEP]concierge gave out great directions for shops / chemists etc.[SEP]it certainly didn't feel like your typical orlando hotel.
1	couldn't agree more with previous reviews - and it's all true!![SEP]perfect location![SEP]friendly, helpful and attentative staff.[SEP]although no meals were available at the hotel it was nice that they provided morning coffe / tea and also had complimentary afternoon sherry in the lounge area.[SEP]the room was spatious, was nicely designed and the bed very comfortable.[SEP]only drawback (very minor though), if you are a light sleeper - there is the street noise of san francisco and the neighbours in the next room![SEP]but hey - the hotel is not sound proof!
1	my friend and i stayed here several years ago to go to a wedding.[SEP]i was hoping for a funky and fun place that is close to shops and cafes.[SEP]the location turned out to be great, but wow the room we stayed in was very very dumpy.[SEP]i was truly disappointed and embarrassed that i booked such an awful room for us to stay for the weekend.[SEP]the floors were dirty, the bathroom was dirty, everything smelled musty.[SEP]it looked run - down and what i hated most was seeing built - in grime on the edges of the floors and walls.[SEP]the bathroom door was grimy.[SEP]not a cozy place to stay ; i think we avoided going back to the room until we had to.[SEP]ever since staying there, i've been extra careful about researching a hotel before booking.[SEP]i would recommend if you are staying at this location (fairfax / beverly) go for the farmer's daughter.
1	even though i had read the reviews, i was disappointed with the wear of the hotel.[SEP]it started with the dated and worn decor in the lobby / elevator and continued to the room.[SEP]we stayed in room 720.[SEP]the bathroom sink was cracked, the tub leaked, the toliet would continue to run, all the fixtures were rusty, there was unpainted dry wall repair, the decor was worn and mismatched.[SEP]my husband was perfectly happy with the room but i would have preferred a more up to date room.[SEP]the ice machine on our floor did not work.[SEP]the staff was friendly enough but didn't interact with them much during our 5 day stay the room was clean, the view was great, parking was good but is an additional cost.[SEP]the restaurant was okay, the only reason we patronized it was because we had coupons for it.[SEP]the location was perfect.[SEP]the pool area was clean and well maintained.[SEP]i would only stay here again if i couldn't get a decent rate else where.
1	we stayed at this hotel during an event weekend (nba all star) and cound't have asked for a better location.[SEP]the hotel was located just outside of downtown in korea town in a friendly residential neighborhood.[SEP]if you are looking for 5 star amenities, don't stay here.[SEP]but if you are looking for a recently updated, clean, hotel with free parking and close to downtown, i would highly reccomend the hotel.[SEP]centrally located, we were able to get to several areas of la with little to no fuss even during the event weekend.[SEP]close to beverly center, staples center, downtown la, and only minutes from hollywood.[SEP]now has become one of my favorite boutique hotels... will stay there again.
1	the belleclaire is very much for those who prefer good value in an outstanding location over the frills or glamor that cost a lot in this town.[SEP]situated in one of the best parts of the upper west side, the hotel is ideal for runners, bikers or nature lovers, since both central and riverside parks are a short walking distance away (note: fantastic bike rental shop on 77th between broadway and amsterdam).[SEP]my very sunny room was on the 7th floor and i had a nice view of the hudson river and the steeple of the beautiful west end collegiate church.[SEP]the deluxe room was stylish and very comfortable, certainly roomy enough for two, with a small fridge, a nice desk and free wifi.[SEP]i worked for two days from a desk here and was very comfortable doing so.[SEP]my bathroom even had a window.[SEP]i found the staff very friendly, and the front desk was always sufficiently manned.[SEP]but it is not for those looking for glamor, especially in the reception area.[SEP]the lobby is clean and functional but it also small, and not a place for gathering.[SEP]but i didn't come to ny to spend time in the lobby, so i could have cared less about this.[SEP]the " room service " is from a diner on the block, and i'd say best to get up and eat elsewhere.[SEP]but i definitely will be coming back to this hotel for its location, beautiful room and great value.
1	fairly typical of a chain of hotels the service is fine if a little impersonal.[SEP]small reception that nobody really gathered in and we never ate at the restaurent so couldn't comment on that.[SEP]the room 1503 was on the corner and very small.[SEP]it did have windows on two walls from which we could see the east river but the pieces of furniture were so big that they just about filled every bit of floorspace.[SEP]the air conditioning was very effective and extremely quiet.[SEP]would have been impossible to survive without it on around the clock.[SEP]the location is fine but with temperatures 100 + degrees during mosr of our stay even the shortest walk had us bathed in sweat but this didn't stop us getting out and about even although the hotel is right at the end of east 42nd street on foot or by subway.[SEP]this does mean that the location is a little quieter than other areas.[SEP]grand central station, top of the rock, central park, dakota, times sqaure, staten island and greenich village easily reached and indeed we managed to get tickets to see phantom on broadway.[SEP]staff were ok but the overall experience and feel about the place is that its a little impersonal although this is not exactly meant as a critisism, more an observation.[SEP]the biggest drawback was the size of the room but i don't think that makes it unique in manhattan.
1	this is our first trip to paris and did not know what to expect in regards to the hotel accommodations.[SEP]but our stay at the lenox hotel was wonderful (better in some ways than the hotels in the us).[SEP]great staff, great location, incredibly clean![SEP]overall a great value.[SEP]weâ€ ™ ll definitely go back!
1	we enjoyed this hotel very much.[SEP]the staff were helpful and friendly.[SEP]the room was on an upper floor and was quite comfortable.[SEP]there was no english tv but the location was what set this hotel apart from others.[SEP]literally a minute or two walk from the main tourist attractions.[SEP]in particular we enjoyed the breakfast which has evertything you could have asked for.[SEP]fresh fruit, yoghurt, pastries, eggs, cold meats and cheeses and turkish sweets.[SEP]great coffee to set you up for the day's touring!
1	i was a little nervous about staying at the edison after reading some of the reviews.[SEP]i'm pleased to say that everything was great.[SEP]we arrived early in the morning, well before check in.[SEP]i was planning to just leave our bags and come back when my room was ready but the front desk offered us a room right away and a free upgrade and even let us go up and check out the room before deciding.[SEP]it was larger than i was expecting and was nice and clean.[SEP]i've travelled enough to know not to expect the ritz and that ny hotels are pricier than most.[SEP]the location was terrific if you want times square and the restaurant attached was very reasonable and served a good breakfast.[SEP]cash only at the restaurant though, unless you set something up with the hotel and your credit card.[SEP]i only hope i'm as pleased with the wellington hotel, my next stop in april/09.
1	we loved this hotel.[SEP]it was the best marriott we stayed at that wasn't a jw.[SEP]the location is probably the best location in all of singapore.[SEP]the dim sum bar was awesome.[SEP]the pool was the best urban hotel pool we've ever had.[SEP]we wrote more details about it on our blog: http://worldfamilytravellers.blogspot.com/2011/12/hotel-review-singapore-marriott-hotel.html
1	we stayed here on a rainy seattle weekend.[SEP]very nice waterfromt location.[SEP]this hotel is great for first time visitors to seattle.[SEP]you are only 3 blocks away from the pike place market.[SEP]that is where i advice going for breakfast or lunch.[SEP]it is very easy to visit the market in the early opening hours, before it gets so busy.[SEP]this hotel is within walking distance of ferry terminals, downtown, and the sculpture park.[SEP]very nice location.[SEP]the staff, especially at the front door were friendly and welcoming.[SEP]nice lobby.[SEP]the beds and linens were great.[SEP]a nice quiet place.[SEP]my only complaint - 32 dollar a day parking.
1	ok so this hotel is a little dated.[SEP]the photos on the website even show that.[SEP]but that being said its such a lovely place to stay.[SEP]my room was huge, with a big bed, nice clean crisp white sheets and loads of good quality pillows.[SEP]huge double wardrobe and big bright window.[SEP]the bathroom was a nice size and i could clearly make out on the shower that the hotel was previously a four seasons, which gave the place a bit of authenticity.[SEP]i used the gym a couple of times and it was always quiet and again, they have lots of machines and weights etc.[SEP]the location is really good for visiting montreal.[SEP]other reviews have commented that they disliked the venetian blind in the window at the side of the bed, but i always sleep with the curtains open so i quite liked this feature.
1	for our first visit to chicago, we found club quarters to be the perfect location.[SEP]it was within walking distance to the places we wanted to see: millenium park, navy pier, mag mile, willis (sears) tower, and so much more.[SEP]easy access to the river walk.[SEP]sure, the room was small but we didn't need or want an overpriced, palatial space (who spends much time in a hotel room, anyway?) we even got a river view room.[SEP]for the price, we almost expected shabby, worn down accommodations but everything was clean, modern, and well kept.[SEP]loved the amenities and services available to members.[SEP]hotel staff was friendly and attentive.[SEP]the restaurant, bella bacino's, attached to club quarters was convenient and welcoming.[SEP]our first night there, we stopped in for a couple drinks and were greeted and treated like old friends.[SEP]on another night, we met a couple friends there for dinner, and the food was superb.[SEP]we will definitely make this our home base whenever we're in chicago.
1	this is one of the worst and most overpriced hotels i have ever stayed in![SEP]it badly needs refurbishing and is seriously out - dated.[SEP]i stayed in a twin room and it was very dark and very small.[SEP]the decor and furniture were ancient (kept expecting sherlock holmes to walk out from somewhere), and the bathroom and fittings were tatty.[SEP]the smell in the lounge and bar was suffocating and smelt like someone or something had died there.[SEP]at breakfast there was a good choice, but it was, as previously stated, chaotic and quite stressful.[SEP]the only good thing about this hotel is the location, but it certainly doesn't warrant the price charged.
1	faultless our stay here was perfect - ok so you're not in manhatten but the location of this hotel offers a quiet retreat from the busy centre something we were glad of after a full on day of sightseeing and shopping.[SEP]the subway is located just behind the hotel or you can have a stroll accross the brooklyn bridge which takes about 20 minutes (highly recommended).[SEP]the hotel itself is fantastic, the staff are friendly, the rooms are huge and clean with a nice bar\restaurant to relax in.[SEP]if you don't fancy going into manhatten at night brooklyn heights is a short walk away and has some nice places to eat.[SEP]it also is ideal for links to jfk airport as the subway line outside the hotel takes you to the airport airtrain for 2 dollars.
1	booked this hotel for a 7 day stay because we had to stay in berlin unexpectedly for another week.[SEP]we wanted cheap and chearful and that s what we got.[SEP]we had a twin room with basin, very small.[SEP]the shower and toliets were down the corridor, but as other rooms on our floor had en - suite we never saw anyone else using them.[SEP]the hotel is staffed with russians so launguage was sometimes a problem.[SEP]the buffet breakfast was just the job, we made up rolls for the day too.[SEP]wifi was way over priced so had to visit local cafes with free internet.[SEP]overall great location and good value if you require more privacy than a hostel but very basic accomodation.
1	this is a very nice hotel.[SEP]up to all of marriott hotel standards (what i really like about marriott -- consistency).[SEP]it is connected to another marriott hotel.[SEP]they have free breakfast, and the other hotel (can't remember name) had better food -- which you can easily walk over to.[SEP]they share same elevators and pool, but have different lobbies (connected though).[SEP]the rooms are small.[SEP]but typical for a city room.[SEP]our 2 younger kids shared a double bed.[SEP]my husband and myself had the other double, and our 12 year old had the pull out sofa bed.[SEP]room had a decent view.[SEP]windows open to outside.[SEP]had a refrigerator too.[SEP]great location.[SEP]lots of stuff close by.[SEP]walked to rainforest cafe restaurant.[SEP]parking is expensive though, and across the street about a block away.[SEP]can only valet park.[SEP]so, we had to take a lot out of the car, since it would be difficult to go back to it.[SEP]used aaa discount, and received at good value for the price.
1	the hotel is what you expect, friendly staff.[SEP]compared to the other hotels of equivalent standing it is 20% cheaper, and breakfast was included in the price.[SEP]nice not to have to pay â‚¬20 - 25.[SEP]breakfast was a typical hotel breakfast, some of the fruit that is offered like the pineapple is tinned not fresh.[SEP]found the evening meal over priced for what was received.[SEP]the gym is very tired with some old treadmills and cross trainers.[SEP]the room was clean, shower worked.[SEP]a pet hate is that the bathrooms are internal and have no external windows.[SEP]however you can get the fast tras to amsterdam, a train direct to the airport and a tram which takes a nice view towards amsterdam.[SEP]hence location is not too bad.[SEP]there is also a lovely park across the road from the hotel which i took a really pleasant walk through.
1	i have just returned from a 5 night trip to new york staying in the herald square hotel.[SEP]we booked this hotel after reading all of the good reviews on trip advisor.[SEP]the hotel was exactly as described.[SEP]location is excellent, which is all important in ny.[SEP]we had booked a large room with two double beds and this is what we got.[SEP]the beds were extremely comfortable and blissful to sink into after a full day of shopping and sightseeing.[SEP]the room was thoroughly cleaned each day with fresh towels also supplied daily.[SEP]i definitely recommend this hotel and will be returning.[SEP]having stayed in an' upmarket' hotel last year, the herald square beat it hands down.
1	we were four adults, two with complex health issues needing to share a room, the helmsley was one of the few hotels that offered two large beds in an adequate sized room at a very good price, despite very poor communication from the hotel before we got there - they did not bother to reply to any of our questions emailed to them - the welcome was fine and apologetic for the service hitherto.[SEP]the room was at the back of the hotel with a wonderful view accross down manhattan and a spectacular view to the side of the empire state framed by two other sky scrapers.[SEP]we were very comfortable though there was no refrigerator - robes, towels and soaps very high quality - bath - just ok![SEP]the staff were kind though once again the concierge service failed sending us to a restaurant where under 21s were not welcome - causing quite an upset.[SEP]the location of this hotel is very good.[SEP]the iconic chrysler building is just a short hop down the road and rooms at the front of the hotel must have had a wonderful view of it - grand central sation just a short walk further down and times square ten minutes further on.[SEP]the restaurant was very expensive and ok - just ok - even if the staff were charming.....[SEP]yet.....[SEP]we would be happy to stay there again, it was great value and better than we expected
1	beautifully appointed historic hotel in a great central location restored to perfection with the most gracious and attentive staff.[SEP]rooms are decorated artistically with a perfect balance of elegance as well as every modern convenience and comfort.[SEP]yes, there is turn down service with those yummy chocolates on the pillow, and the ample supply of bottled water is always replenished.[SEP]the staff are personable and helpful, and detail oriented to the extent that they often anticipate needs.[SEP]the ambience in the grand lobby combines opulent elegance with wonderfully comfortable furnishings arranged in separated sitting areas perfect for meeting with friends or business associates.[SEP]the bar area is open and comfortable and happy hour is an especially good value.[SEP]the appetizers available in the bar area are fabulous, and the restaurant is a fine dining destination.[SEP]in the morning, the coffee available off the lobby is really, really delicious and can be enjoyed on site or as take out.[SEP]room service is terrific and always right on time.[SEP]looking forward to our next stay in san diego at the u.s. grant.
1	my mom and i take a girls weekend trip to nyc every other year or so and usually stay at the hyatt above grand central.[SEP]we decided to stay here this time because i could get the hilton points.[SEP]we were extremely pleased with the switch![SEP]the staff was extremely accommodating, especially the manager tessa marie, who let us check in early and even upgraded our room.[SEP]the room was relatively small, but more than adequate.[SEP]besides, who spends much time in their room during a vacation to nyc?[SEP]the hotel bar was a little pricey, but that's pretty par for the course for hotel bars.[SEP]the location is great.[SEP]we'd definitely stay here again and recommend others do the same!
1	stayed one night: because it was near where i needed to be early next morning.[SEP]twin with breakfast for £ 117 through otel.com, which is pretty good for a branded hotel in central london.[SEP]room was clean, breakfast excellent, staff friendly and helpful.[SEP]good location, russel square tube just round the corner, holborn about 10 minutes away with better connections.[SEP]lots of good pubs and restaurants nearby.[SEP]will certainly use again.
1	i received a recommendation from a friend about the inn at st.[SEP]botolph.[SEP]i have never been to boston so i accepted the recommendation and i have never been happier with my choice![SEP]i received an e - mail notification prior to my arrival with check - in information.[SEP]the keyless entry system is genius -- i felt very safe at the inn.[SEP]my husband and i were assigned room 103.[SEP]the room has a kitchenette, sitting area, fire place, and bedroom (see pictures).[SEP]there was plenty of space to unwind![SEP]the hotel staff was excellent and provided great restaurant recommendations.[SEP]the inn also offers a complimentary breakfast which includes bagels, breakfast bars, refreshments, etc.[SEP]the inn is right across the street from the prudential which has numerous shops and restaurants.[SEP]the location of the inn can not be beat![SEP]we took a taxi from location to location simply because the weather was very, very cold (10 degrees) and since we were unfamiliar with the city we did not want to bother with trying to figure out the subway system.[SEP]overall, the experience was excellent and we will definitely be staying at the inn at st.[SEP]botolph when we make it back to boston!
1	first time to vegas and stayed at the venetian.[SEP]very impressive property and a great location on the strip.[SEP]said we were upgraded on arrival but not sure if we got a better room, perhaps just a better view.[SEP]our friends were also upgraded and although they have no view there room was 3 or 4 times the size of ours!![SEP]i preferred the view anyway![SEP]the only down side is as the hotel is so big it is a long walk to everywhere and you can easily get lost
1	the hotel location was in a prime area.[SEP]a walking distance from the louvre, and the notre - dam cathedral.[SEP]the hotel personnel were very helpful and friendly.[SEP]they were very receptive to requests.[SEP]the room are cozy and very clean.[SEP]good value for money.
1	apologies for the late review as i have been doing plenty of travelling and will be posting various reviews of various hotels during my travel.[SEP]planet hollywood towers is not the same as planet hollywood resort.[SEP]the ph towers is the new extension and should not be confused with the resort.[SEP]ph towers room that i stayed in is new + contemporary.[SEP]the finishing is nice.[SEP]ph towers is not on the strip like the ph resort.[SEP]so they couldn't give me a view of the strip.[SEP]walking to the strip is through the " miracle mile shops " which it shares with the ph resort.[SEP]the shops aren't expensive and affordable.[SEP]unlike the shops in bellagio which everything cost an arm and a leg.[SEP]we have breakfast everyday in " miracle mile shops " and it's very convenient and affordable.[SEP]we obtained a good rate which was approx usd150 or so and was more than satisified with what we got in return.[SEP]location is very good as it's next to " paris " and opposite " bellagio " which is more or less the middle of the vegas strip.[SEP]the people there was helpful.[SEP]the pool was absolutely gorgeous to look at.[SEP]unfortunately i couldn't give it a try as it was freezing during christmas times.
1	what a disappointing hotel.[SEP]i stay at westin hotels all over the world, and have come to respect and rely on their consistent quality and service.[SEP]that past experience made my stay at this hotel all the more unpleasant.[SEP]the location is perfect, but the good news unfortunately stops there.[SEP]the rooms were plain, and poorly furnished (the tv looked like something out of the honeymooners, there was no phone at the desk, no full length mirror, etc).[SEP]the voice mail didn't work, i never received my alarm calls, and the restaurant was more like a glorified snack bar.[SEP]you had to pay to use the hotel beach, and the pool was contaminated with babies swimming in soiled diapers.[SEP]i've' traveled rough', and backpacked, and that is ok at the right time and place, it's just not the experience i expect from a westin.[SEP]i suspect the problem is that the hotel is split, and the real amenities and quality are in the sister location in sunset key.[SEP]i know at least two guests upped and moved over there during my stay.[SEP]the key west part of the resort appears to be treated as the cinderella, or unwanted step child, and unfortunately the amenities and service reflect this.[SEP]don't waste your money, the 3 star southernmost hotel at the other end of duval street is much nicer, is a lot better value, and doesn't even charge guests to use its beach!.
1	as part of our turkey tour, this was our first and last hotel where we stayed in.[SEP]they have a central location, easy to get taxis, access to restaurants and shops.[SEP]the rooms were clean and comfortable, safe in the room, free internet, ac worked fine.[SEP]the staff was very helpful also.[SEP]we had dinner at the restaurant, the food was good but they were understaffed and made some mistakes with the orders, but they had a great attitude.[SEP]breakfast buffet was ok also, not, any fruits available, but many different kind of olives were available.
1	my friend and i had a wondersful 5 night stay at the palace and all the staff we met were very professional, courteous and helpful.[SEP]it is in a wonderful location and with the advice of ricardo the concierge we ate at some very good (reasonably priced) restaurants and saw a great flamenco show.[SEP]we had already booked two day trips with viator - el escorial and toledo one day and then avila and segovia another which were both fascinating.[SEP]you learn a lot about a city exploring its environs.[SEP]we had a very enjoyable and restful break from our busy lives - thanks westin![SEP]ps there are major road building works around the city at present but what city does not have them![SEP]it did not deter us from our enjoyment of this great city.
1	i have average expectations when staying at a motel or hotel being in the restaurant industry.[SEP]my main expectation is that the room be clean and in good repair.[SEP]i was very pleased with this place, room was clean and in good reapir.[SEP]room size was great.[SEP]we had plenty of room to get ready and for all the stuff we brought with us, which for a three day trip was alot.[SEP]i ate at the restaurant my wife loved her meal the bacon cheesbuger but the talapia was not the best.[SEP]it is more of a diner than a restaurant so don't have high expectations but it is nice having one on site.[SEP]there are serveral restaurants in the area, none are chains.[SEP]front desk staff are average some good, some bad.[SEP]drivers for shuttle were excellent... free shuttle to seaworld that s a $12 savings on parking.[SEP]i tipped the driver.[SEP]but no fast food in the immediate area, but its only 5 or 10 min away.[SEP]same with all the other chain restaurants.[SEP]general location is great and easy to find, right of i-8.
1	well the best thing is the location only two mins from baker street station.[SEP]from the outside it looks ok as well.[SEP]reception staff were on the minimum wage and i felt sorry for them ; they must get so many complaints.[SEP]the rooms were tired, paint peeling off walls etc but were clean as far as i could see.[SEP]the worst thing was the constant noise from the creeky floor boards.[SEP]above me were several people in a room who were busy until 4.30 am![SEP]what they were up to i am not sure... its that sort of hotel.[SEP]breakfast in the morning was not good, with the english breakfast especially not recommended and the cornflakes probably had a sale by date of last year.[SEP]the oddest thing was the breakfast room looked as though it had been decorated by a 6 year old.[SEP]there was paint on the threadbare carpet and the door had obviously been painted in less than 2 minutes.[SEP]so overall impression was disappoiting... apart from the location which was good.
1	this is a great location for visiting indy.[SEP]the only problem we had was the panhandlers on the street as you walk.[SEP]the hotel was clean and the staff very friendly.[SEP]the valet parking guys were very fast if you needed your car.[SEP]this is next to the circle center mall and lots of restuarants.[SEP]try the weber grill.
1	my wife and i stayed here for two nights prior to our q.m.2 cruise, this was our first trip to america so somewhat unsure of how it would be.[SEP]the hotel was welcoming, our room was ready, at about 1300 hours and everything went very smoothly.[SEP]our room 1405 we found to be comfortable, clean, quiet and of a good size.[SEP]the bathroom was clean, lots of towels and worked well all in all everything you could want of a city centre hotel.[SEP]staff were friendly and helpful and well what a position, walked to times square, central park, a broadway show etc all very easily and quickly.[SEP]all in all as stated a great location at a value for money price.[SEP]did not eat in the hotel but did have drinks and again a very pleasant experience.[SEP]we would use this hotel again
1	we chose the hotel muguet based on what we had read in the rick steves paris guide and the nytimes travel section.[SEP]i can't imagine a better place given the price and location.[SEP]although we arrived at 10 am they had no problem checking us into our room.[SEP]and we were delighted to find that our little window terrace looked out on the eiffel tower.[SEP]yes, the rooms are very small, but my daughter and i were still able to do yoga (at the same time) and my question for those who complain about small hotel rooms in paris is: why are you spending so much time in your room?![SEP]the help spoke english well and did not bat an eye when i told them i had spilled a cup of coffee in my room.[SEP]when i returned that afternoon there was not a trace of the damage i did.[SEP]the location is incredibly quiet even though you are right in the midst of paris.[SEP]rue cler is just two blocks away and is a lively scene of cafes, boutiques, and specialty shops.[SEP]there are plenty of wonderful and reasonably priced dining options to choose from in this area.[SEP]my only complaint is that my bed was a bit too firm for my liking.
1	i stayed at the hotel for four nights in august with my young family and a group of friends.[SEP]we had the most wonderful stay.[SEP]the staff were extremely friendly and helpful and went out of their way to help me with some business communications.[SEP]the restaurant staff were delightful and so kind to our 8 month old baby.[SEP]rooms were spotless and gorgeous.[SEP]will always stay in rome at the hotel de russie - its location is superb and the hotel is the epitome of elegance and grace.
1	was in toronto to run the scotia bank toronto waterfront marathon, and this hotel was perfect for that.[SEP]the location was with in walking distance of everthing.[SEP]the room was large, clean and very comfortable.[SEP]the service at check in and out, plus the nice size business center made everything very pleasant.[SEP]i highly recommend this hotel if you are staying in toronto.
1	i stay at this hotel a 3 - 4 times per year.[SEP]i like the location because it is near the airport and east coast.[SEP]this is good for business and leisure.[SEP]i just held a meeting of 20 people and thought the staff provided great service, and like the hotel, a good value for a business meeting.[SEP]the buffet food is better than most hotel food and changes daily.
1	booked into the paramount as a group for a wedding.[SEP]the staff are v helpful.[SEP]but be advised the price reflects the location not the rooms.[SEP]we had a double booked and it was tiny!![SEP]managed to upgrade to queen which was much better.[SEP]us doubles are not the same as uk.[SEP]if you are doing a normal ny visit where u spend no time in the room it's great, but if you book as you are wanting some luxury it's not the best.[SEP]the lobby has free wifi, and looks amazing.[SEP]the bar is very expensive, but there are loads of other bars close by.[SEP]i recommend turning right out if the hotel walking in the opposite direction to time sq the next block over has loads of great restaurants and bars.[SEP]room do have a hairdryer, mirror is on bathroom door so it's hard if you want to use it and someone wants to come out if the bathroom.[SEP]i would not recommend sharing if you are going with someone who you don't know.[SEP]to sum this place up for me.[SEP]nothing wrong with it, but stayed in low cost good location hotels before (check out the pod hotel) but thought i would be getting luxury this time.
1	we recently stayed at the roosevelt for vacation.[SEP]contrary to other comments, i found the staff professional and courteous.[SEP]the location was a few blocks from times square, grand central and the rockefeller center.[SEP]we had a nice room overlooking madison avenue.[SEP]the decor was fine but dated.[SEP]i understand they are updating rooms, but probably did not get one because we bought thru hotels.com.[SEP]i would definitely stay here again.
1	we spent 3 nights at hotel 31 with my girlfriend to visit new york.[SEP]the location is great, next to the empire state building and close enough from union square.[SEP]the room: + clean + tv + heated + small sink and mirrors + the maids actually respect the " no disturbing " sign which is not always the case ;) - pretty small rooms - the heating system is pretty loud during night and it is hard to find the right temperature the very good surprise came from the shared bathroom which was always very clean, both shower and toilets![SEP]no problems also concerning the water temperature.[SEP]the staff was smilling and serving too![SEP]if you are looking for a nice location in new york, for a short stay, at a decent price, go for it![SEP]we were really afraid about the shared bathroom but this hotel proved us wrong a great value for a nice stay at a very decent price!
1	we got a discounted deal on this nice hotel, although it was the most expensive hotel we stayed in on our two week trip.[SEP]we were not informed that the reduced rate deal basically meant a much smaller size handicapped room - not that it was that inexpensive.[SEP]the address can be confusing if you don't already know where it is.[SEP]if you're not taking a cab there, be sure and call and get the location ; when google maps had problems and the address similarly was inaccurate somehow.[SEP]very nice door staff.[SEP]the hotel bar closes what i deem to be a little early.[SEP]nice hotel.[SEP]if you want a nice view of elliott bay, don't stay here.[SEP]on balance, a nice historic hotel well located in seattle.[SEP]possibly expensive relative to value, but fairmont isn't known for being cheap anyway.
1	the main thing to remember when looking at booking the edison is " you get what you pay for.[SEP]" its location is second to none - being right on the doorstep of times square with 49th street subway 2 blocks away, 2 superb delis and a good pub on the same street and in spitting distance of many attractions, restaurants and bars.[SEP]the hotel however needs a great deal of money spent on it.[SEP]the best thing about it is the lobby which is clean and art deco in style.[SEP]despite what i had read on here i didn't find the rooms too small, it had a desk, chest of drawers and 2 side tables and was plenty big enough for the small amount of time we spent in the room.[SEP]the room was just incredibly dated and quite tatty looking, it was ok for a short trip and as we're used to staying in hostels we can manage with varying levels of decor but if you are looking for somewhere to stay for a romantic break or a place to take your mum i wouldn't recommend it.[SEP]the shower had parts of tiles missing and around the plug the bath had lost it's colour so was showing rusty brown underneath.[SEP]the shower dripped constantly but this wasn't the worst thing, when ever anyone used the taps the pipes would scream and rubble, this was particularly unpleasant at 6.30am.[SEP]if you can afford a little more for accomodation then definitely look at a more modern hotel but if you are looking for something that is cheap and cheerful then edison is a good choice.
1	my family and i stayed here this past weekend.[SEP]great location and walking distance to great shops and restaurants.[SEP]how can it be bad being across from shake shack and a block from eataly?[SEP]entire building is spotless.[SEP]front desk staff friendly and helpful.[SEP]ca nt wait to return.[SEP]as an added bonus, we were able to park on the stree steps from the hotel.
1	excellent view of the sd's bay, great breakfast and awesome place to have a beer by the end of the day.[SEP]the rooms are not brand new, but you can really feel like if you're at home at some point, since the environment if more than friendly.[SEP]more than enough to workout by the morning with a couple of fitness rooms, and nice outdoor pool.[SEP]good and fast laundry and dry clean services, and well equipped biz center for excecutives.[SEP]this hotel offers the best combination on a great location for much less than others on the same area ; actually the main reason why i rate it as excellent.[SEP]the restaurant bar, which is actually a very nice pub, the elephant & the castle is just a great place to finish the day, and take a look on the pics the family took during the day, make a catch - up of the day with friends, or wrap up a biz day with the peers or your boss.[SEP]although the parking is charged, you can feel safe, and much better, your car will really be close to your room at any time.
1	great location.[SEP]our room looked out on times square and every night we fell asleep when we look at the changing square lights.[SEP]the staff was professional and ready to help.[SEP]we forgot some clothes in the hotel and after a few days we received them.[SEP]but despite the praise we weren't so happy - we could enter our room only at prescribed time.[SEP]after aboout 11 hours of flight we had to sit in the lobby for almost 3 hours.[SEP]our room wasn't so clean, not always the cleaning lady suck the dust from the carpet.
1	a nice weekend in paris.[SEP]good location.[SEP]room 605 was acceptable and was cleaned every day.[SEP]quite small but i guess that's paris.[SEP]the breakfast is too expensive, around there are beautiful cafes cheaper and with more charm and natural light.[SEP]good value for money but don't think to come on a honey moon
1	my husband and i stayed at this hotel for a weekend break.[SEP]we booked a superior corner room which was expensive but as we were going for such a short time we decided to splash out.[SEP]the hotel itself is in a fantastic location and is really nice inside however we experienced a serious problem with our room.[SEP]we are both hyper sensitive to dust and the first morning we woke we started sneezing.[SEP]we went out for the day and night thinking that it was the flight over or something else that was causing it.[SEP]the following morning we woke up once again sneezing.[SEP]at this point i noticed in the morning that a film of dust was covering all of the surfaces in the bedroom.[SEP]i called reception and they sent someone from housekeeping up to view the room.[SEP]i showed them the problem and they agreed that it was dusty and couldn't explain it (i thought it may have been a recent refurbishment but nobody indicated that it was).[SEP]by late that evening they offered to change our room but at that point in the trip it was pretty pointless as we were leaving the next evening.[SEP]we had expected some reflection of the issue in our hotel bill which was not forthcoming.[SEP]so we were pretty disappointed to be honest, for a top class hotel to ignore the issue on checkout was amazing.[SEP]needless to say we won't be staying there again and would advise any hayfever or dust allergic travellers to beware!
1	great service right from the moment we landed - limo pick - up (highly recommended) takes you directly from the airport to your room bypassing the check - in desk and makes all the difference after a long flight.[SEP]rooms very comfortable, well presented with great views of the harbour (a must when in hong kong).[SEP]we had a very nice meal in jw's california and jordi villegas's signature dish of suckling pig deserves the accolade![SEP]we would also recommed the breakfast and lunch buffet - both are of a very high standard and with almost too many choices.[SEP]the bar was also a very nice place to relax, with good cocktails and live music.[SEP]location is very good with direct access to pacifc place shopping and the mtr station.[SEP]the star ferry is also walkable (10 - 15mins).[SEP]hong kong park is just behind the hotel and provides easy access, very tranquil and the best way to go for the peak tram.[SEP]visited the outside pool area (which we didn't get a chance to use) - but looked like a very nice place to relax amongst the skyscrapers.
1	we spent 4 nights in morgana.[SEP]i disagree with others who found reception bad, i thought they were helpful and courteous.[SEP]rooms are small and lifts poor, breakfast was basic but plenty of it, nice comfortable breakfast room and no rush, staff were pleasant.[SEP]it is a seedy area and i would nt like walking around this area late at night.[SEP]we had children so it did nt affect us as we were in by about 11 pm latest.[SEP]for touring rome it is a good location just beside termini station.[SEP]overall it'd say it does the job ok but if going again, i d have a look around for something a bit better
1	room was in forum tower which seems to have been renovated recently.[SEP]all the perks, tv in bathroom mirror, lights on / off auto., drapes drawn by switch, beautifully decorated.[SEP]now the cons.[SEP]five minutes to get to tower, takes forever to get from a restaurant to room or another location.[SEP]it is across from flamingo, harrah, imperial, so location is good.[SEP]only negative comment would be their buffet.[SEP]very limited compared to other strip buffets, plus pastries did not taste fresh.[SEP]would not go back to this buffet.
1	absolutely fabulous!!![SEP]we had a wonderful time in this hotel.[SEP]the location is great, a minutes walk from the subway, the reception area is very white and spacious (that s not a bad thing though!) and the staff can not do enough to help you.[SEP]there is a bar / restaurants / a cafe all of which i actually didn't visit as there is so much more to see in the city but they looked nice![SEP]we paid a little extra to have a room above the 34th floor, it was well worth it as the views were stunning also helped by the fact that we had a perfect view of mount fuji![SEP]the bed was huge and the room very comfortable with everything that we needed.[SEP]we booked through worldhotels.com which had cheaper rates than the hotel direct and the other usual travel websites.
1	this is our first visit.[SEP]we stayed for 9 nights during spring break this year.[SEP]this is great value for good reasonable rate.[SEP]good location, friendly staff, clean quiet room, and excellent breakfast.[SEP]i'd recommend this hotel to my friends.
1	* * * * surely.[SEP]superb location for city centre, main area offering vibrancy of beautiful barcelona ; ideal for picking up tourist bus, an essential for those new to the city.[SEP]we did the red and blue open top on the same day.[SEP]beautiful weather.[SEP]access from airport excellent.[SEP]definitinely recommended![SEP]although too chilly to use pool, the pool area was a nice place to relax after a hard day's sight seeing with a large glass of wine - from the spar around the corner![SEP]ideal for smokers!
1	aside from the bizarre room layout and the tired carpets and paintwork the room was clean and comfortable.[SEP]we had everything we needed for a restful nights sleep and a shower the next morning.[SEP]was it worth the money?[SEP]of course not.[SEP]but then you have to take the location into account, its literally a 3 min walk from harrods.[SEP]i had booked the room and then read the abysmal reviews on trip advisor so expected the absolute worst.[SEP]first of all let me address the lift, its one of the old time lifts and the doors want to close all the time, they are spring loaded we had luggage and yes it was a pin that they wanted to close but dangerous?[SEP]no.[SEP]only if you are in the habit of sticking your hands into machinery would it become dangerous.[SEP]the staff were very friendly and when we asked for an ironing board they were more than happy to bring it to the room.[SEP]as i have said, the room was clean if a little tired.[SEP]was it 4 *?[SEP]no way, maybe 2 *, was it worth the £ 231 a night we paid, no way.[SEP]but given the location, are you really going to get better?[SEP]i doubt it.[SEP]i would stay there again if i could get a better price, at the end of the day i went there fearing the absolute worst and was pleasantly surprised.
1	in addition to the convenient location (walking distance to shopping and tourist attractions) and the grand foyer, the sheraton's recently renovated rooms help creat a fabulous stay.[SEP]i was told the rooms had been renovated less than two months prior to my stay, and i believe them from the tip - top shape of my room.[SEP]everything was very clean.[SEP]i loved the bathroom decor... and you get a loofah![SEP]room service provides good food, although the wait staff is hit or miss as far as personality goes.
1	charming, clean, and great staff my boyfriend and i stayed at the hotel boheme in the middle of january.[SEP]upon arrival we were a little skeptical as the doorway is slightly hidden between an italian restaurant and coffee bar / bakery.[SEP]as soon as we walked in we received a very warm welcome, a map of the area, and an invitation to a glass of nightly sherry.[SEP]sitting in the entry way is a book of historical newspaper clippings and articles about some of the famous people from the beat generation and the surrounding san francisco area.[SEP]when we walked into our room we were slightly taken back by the size (small) of the room.[SEP]the bed had one of those mesquito netting things hanging over top of it, which we continue to joke about now.[SEP]after our initial shock we began to love our cute little hotel centered in the middle of a great italian neighborhood and in walking distance of nearly every attraction.[SEP]you really couldn't ask for a better location.[SEP]the staff was superb, you will know them by first name after a day of staying.[SEP]you are provided a key to the front door so each night you return it is almost as if you were staying with a family member or friend.[SEP]we fell in love with this hotel and are very pleased we stayed at the boheme.[SEP]only one word of caution... it is a very quite hotel, this may be a blessing or in some few cases, a curse.
1	we stayed in the hotel from 12/12/11 to 16/12/11 and on arrival were initially surprised as it was quite dark and dingy in reception but over a few days that opinion changed to quirky.[SEP]the room on the 3rd floor was also very small and we were initially disappointed as the bathroom had old fittings and a stainless steel sink and looked tired but again the room turned out to be very comfortable and clean but very small and sparsely furnished, dingy corridors though.[SEP]very central location made up for the defects!![SEP]reception staff were very helpful and wi - fi in reception was great with access to ipads.[SEP]beware though if booking a car to newark - don't try to pay by credit card as i got a cc rate from the hotel but arrived at newark and had to run around like a headless chicken looking for a cash machine.[SEP]also if you buy an international dialling card for 10 dollars it will cost you 1.25 dollars per call to use it, a 52 dollar charge which reception cut to 26 dollars(1st hotel in ny we have been charged in).[SEP]also 2 dollars per bag to store our bags is a new way of charging customers and also a 1st.[SEP]carve around the corner was a real find bacon and egg bap with a deliciouscoffee for 3dollars 75(same as a coffee in the coffee shop attached to the hotel).[SEP]great trip all round, don't miss jersey boys and sister act and visit woodbury common to shop.
1	the family room at the abcone is incredibly large by london standards.[SEP]it is also clean with a modern and well equipped bathroom.[SEP]as side note, a travel companion of ours stayed in a single room and it was only about big enough to fit the single bed that it contained.[SEP]however, it was clean and the bed was comfortable and it had a good bathroom.[SEP]it was actually all he needed.[SEP]the hotel is not fancy, but the staff was very helpful and the price is right for a safe area which is very well located.[SEP]the location was perfect.[SEP]it is just a couple minute walk from the gloucester road tube station which has three tube lines.[SEP]those lines include the piccadilly line which offers easy access to heathrow.[SEP]also, if you enjoy walking, you can walk to many attractions such as harods, victoria and albert musuem, natural history museum, science museum, kensington park and kensignton palace and more.[SEP]other attraction are a quick tube ride away.[SEP]my only complaint was that one of the front desk staff had terrible bo, which considering the lobby is very small, was inescapable and even hung around after he left.
1	it was not difficult to find this hotel, well thanks to its amazing location![SEP]we took the bus 197 from schipol airport and stop at hobbemastraat near the rijksmuseum.[SEP]you can easily find the street name leading to this hotel, jan luijkenstraat.[SEP]we were greeted by martin, the ever so friendly guy!while waiting for our room to be ready, he was so helpful by showing us the places we wanted to go, emphasizing on the shopping districts.[SEP]we instantly felt at ease![SEP]=) we got room no 14 and it was amazing to the top![SEP]love the warm feelings of the room, clean bathroom (with rubber ducky!), wide glass windows and most importantly, nespresso machine![SEP]how does these guys know i love coffee??[SEP];) i will definitely come back again to stay at this hotel.[SEP]highly recommended!
1	recently stayed at the regency for a long weekend in new york.[SEP]this is the third time i have stayed at this hotel in the last year and it is always a pleasure.[SEP]the staff is very helpful and the rooms are quite nice and very large.[SEP]the location is great.[SEP]the neighborhood is quiet and very upscale and yet close to everything.
1	stay there with my family four nights.[SEP]small rooms, old building yet clean and almost everything runs pretty well.[SEP]the front desk clerks were friendly and very helpful.[SEP]they did everything they promised.[SEP]location is good for tight budget tourists.[SEP]# 45 bus terminal station is only one block away.[SEP]not far from the crissy field and palace of fine art.[SEP]hiking to the golden gate bridge is also not difficult for young children.[SEP]my biggest problem during stay is internet access, most of the time it won't work and the manager on duty told me it's the internet service provider's problems, they can't solve it.
1	positives: we loved the hotel especially it's location.[SEP]staff were really helpful and friendly.[SEP]it was great to have two double beds in the room.[SEP]never got to use the pool but it did look nice and inviting.[SEP]negatives: the bathroom was very small and dated.[SEP]cleanliness of the room could have been better (everything felt' sticky' including the bedside drawers).[SEP]need more hangers in the wardrobe.[SEP]i didn't like the bed - there is a felt pad between the mattress and the bottom sheet which is not secured and i am a restless sleeper so every morning my bed looked like a war zone![SEP]air con set to 72 and not adjustable.
1	i stayed at this place in nov, and had a overall good experience.[SEP]from my perspective here are the positives and negatives of the place positives 1) great location.[SEP]right next to times square, and close to penn station.[SEP]2) comfortable, and clean room.[SEP]3) had a promo offer of free breakfast, which was ok quality.[SEP]if i were to pay for it, and/or compare it to other properties, i would rate it average (or slightly below).[SEP]4) most of the staff was helpful.[SEP]negatives 1) rooms were smaller (typical of ny).[SEP]2) had a slightly negative experience with an associate, who was nt ready to honor the promotion i had taken, since she was nt aware of it.[SEP]had to explain the stuff in detail to her, and even then got partial benefit.[SEP]overall, i would recommend the place due to solid location
1	the only thing i didn't expect from this hotel was the size of the room.[SEP]usually a suite has quite a bit more space than this, but this room looks like it used to be a standard room and a suite's furniture / accommodations were shoe - horned into it.[SEP]see the little sketch i did of the floor plan in my pictures... when the sleeper sofa was out you could barely get around the room.[SEP]for the four of us with luggage and shopping packages it was a bit of a pain.[SEP]otherwise the hotel was great... very clean, friendly staff, decent breakfast, great location, and a fair price.[SEP]the steep parking fees are ugly, but you can reduce these by $10/night by self parking... the valet / bellman at the door told us all about it and how to do it so it wasn't a hassle at all.[SEP]would definitely stay here again if it's just the wife and i, or get two rooms if the kids come along.
1	as has been mentioned here, the location is near perfect - we spent a week with my wife and 9 y.o. daughter, and did not even use the metro for the first 3 days.[SEP]great breakfast.[SEP]our room (506) was very quiet, looking into the courtyard.[SEP]last year we stayed in elysees regencia, which has been close to # 1 on this list for sometime.[SEP]in my mind, k+k beats regencia hands down.[SEP]the clear advantages are the location (walk to louvre, d'orsay, notre dame, rodin, even tour eiffel and opera), neighbourhood (leisurley stroll to st.[SEP]germaine de pres and odeon for dinner and shopping), rooms (real triple room with real 3rd bed, and plenty of room for people and luggage, better furniture, desk, minibar, safe), better breakfast, and better value (regencia doubled their prices since last year, thanks to all the hipe from trip adv., so k+k, while still very expensive, is cheaper).[SEP]can't see how people will rate regencia higher than k+k.[SEP]the staff was great, their diner tip at la petit chaise was great, wish they knew more good restaurants in the area.[SEP]one minor glitch: the hotel web site makes it certain that you get wi - fi in the room, but in fact it's only in the lobby.[SEP]you get wired connection (no extra charge) in the room, but if you like browsing internet in the bed - bring your own x - long data cable.
1	my husband and i stayed at hotel thirty thirty for a few nights on a vacation in june.[SEP]overall, we had a great experience.[SEP]we arrived at the hotel around 11 am (moving from another hotel) and were hoping that the hotel would store our bags until we could check - in.[SEP]they ended up having a room available and let us check - in right away![SEP]we stayed in the standard renovated king and we were very surprised at the size for the price (we may have gotten a good deal because we booked close to our travel date and it was in the middle of their renovations).[SEP]the room was clean and spacious and gave us plenty of room to spread out.[SEP]we were on the inside of the hotel, so the view wasn't good, but we weren't expecting a view with what we paid.[SEP]there was some construction noise, but it didn't bother us.[SEP]the location is fantastic - we felt very safe walking back late at night and were only a few blocks from the metro.[SEP]our flight didn't leave nyc until night and we were able to store our bags at the hotel so that we could do some sight - seeing our last day.[SEP]we really appreciated this amenity![SEP]we would definitely recommend stating at hotel thirty thirty.
1	stayed on business for 2 nights, great location for the airport.[SEP]hotel is currently undergoing a large extension so be aware of that.[SEP]also if you are noise sensitive make sure a) you are no where near the night club, which is open to 3 am and b) on the back of the hotel, the road outside is busy and rather loud.[SEP]the hotel kindly changed my room at 2 am after 4hrs of trying to sleep with the base coming from the club![SEP]so no complaints on the service.
1	this was my first trip to new york in january 2011.[SEP]this hotel was thencalled hotel thirty thirty![SEP]i went with a group of 10 collegues.[SEP]i loved the location of this hotel, it was very close to maddison square gardens, about a 5 - 10 min walk from grand central and a 15 min walk to times square.[SEP]the hotel had not been renovated like it is now, but i still thought it was lovely then.[SEP]our room was quite small compared to some of the other ladies we were on the trip with.[SEP]we did have to move rooms due to the toilet flooding in the bathroom, which was nt really the highlight of the trip, still the staff were friendly and helpfull.[SEP]they were also evry happy to keep our luggage stored until we needed to leave.[SEP]i would definatly recommed this hotel!!
1	stayed here solely based on price as well as the ideal location, but in the future i'd spring for something a little more pricey based on my experience here.[SEP]the rooms are opened with keys (not cards) which you have to leave at the front desk each time you exit the hotel.[SEP]the beds were very uncomfortable and i found i got outside noise even though i was facing an alley (in a different manhattan hotel, i faced 7th ave and had no noise issues).[SEP]the tv got around 7 channels and all of them barely came in with the rabbit ears antenna.[SEP]it wasn't an awful experience but the hotel had very few redeeming qualities.
1	without a doubt, the hotel al ponte mocenigo deserves the high praise it receives here on trip advisor.[SEP]as a solo traveler, i stayed in a generous single room for four nights in early june.[SEP]the furnishings were elegant, the artwork unique, and the property overall spotless and well - maintained.[SEP]a hearty continental breakfast (with amazingly good warm croissants) is served either indoors or in the hotelâ€ ™ s courtyard garden.[SEP]i was equally impressed by the location, just steps away from the san stae vaporetto stop on the grand canal.[SEP]while i watched a great many tourists heave luggage over the cityâ€ ™ s small canals and bridges, the hotelâ€ ™ s main entrance along fondamenta rimpetto mocenigo required few steps, and the secondary entrance off of calle dei preti none at all.[SEP]walking to and from the hotel was an equal delight.[SEP]the immediate neighborhood is quiet, charming, and largely overlooked by the hoards of visitors who congregate in st.[SEP]markâ€ ™ s square, and yet that vibrant piazza, and the rialto bridge and market you cross along the way, are just a fifteen minute stroll by foot.[SEP]it really is the best of both worlds.[SEP]my thanks go out to walter and sandro and the rest of the staff for their warm hospitality!
1	stayed here with my husband during the last week of september 2010.[SEP]the location is great as we were a stones throw away from times square.[SEP]the hotel however was awful.[SEP]the reception area downstairs looks fine but when we got out of the lift on the 7th floor to go to our room, we were hit by a terrible musty smell in the passage.[SEP]we had to put up with this for the 3 nights that we were there.[SEP]those carpets really need to be cleaned or removed.[SEP]then when we got to the room, there was the same musty smell which led us having to go and buy scented candles to hide the smell.[SEP]the room and bathroom was old and run down.[SEP]not nice at all.[SEP]the hairdryer in the bathroom hadn't been cleaned for ages (full of fluff / dust and starnds of someone's hair).[SEP]and finally, the bedbugs.... by the end of our short stay, i was covered in bed bug bites.[SEP]seems like we paid for the location and nothing else.[SEP]wouldn't stay here again, i would rather pay a bit more and have a more comfortable stay.
1	usually when i visit new york, i sleep on my sister's couch, so this was definetly an upgrade.[SEP]it was for work, otherwise i wouldn't have been able to stay in such a great location and in such a nice place.[SEP]the hotel itself seemed pretty new and trendy.[SEP]the lobby was small, and so was my room, but the beds were very comfy and the bathroom was nice.[SEP]the room was very quiet, always important when staying in manhattan.[SEP]only had two real complaints: there were no coffee makers in the room (not good for an addict like me), and sometimes it was hard to figure out how to use the technology (it was 3 days before we figured out the do not disturb light button).[SEP]overall though, really good location, good service, liked the conference rooms, paid wifi in all the rooms, quiet, comfy.
1	another great hotel found thanks to the advice given by trip advisor.[SEP]it was great to receive a glass of nice chillied cava on arrival and the staff were friendly and polite.[SEP]breakfast was an excellent affair (not sure about the scrambled eggs though) and although we never used the bar service it was another nice touch.[SEP]the hotel itself is very modern, small however very comfy.[SEP]the double room we booked was very good value (go to justhotel.com website) with two single rock hard beds put together.[SEP]the shower room was slippery and the air con was a nice.[SEP]be aware of the lack of hangers and pack a few extras.[SEP]the big up is the location.[SEP]it can not be beaten.[SEP]all in all we loved it.
1	we recently stayed at this property to attend a nearby conference at the hilton.[SEP]we had a group of 10 with 4 rooms.[SEP]our check in was flawless and all of our rooms were together as we requested.[SEP]our room with a king bed was huge and had an amazing view of home plate at camden yards.[SEP]we enjoyed breakfast each morning, and i was very pleased at the selection.[SEP]the hotel is in a great location, literally across the street from camden yards and within walking distance to the inner harbor.[SEP]the front desk clerk (friday and saturday night) and the bellman were both so helpful to our group in suggesting restaurants, directions, etc.[SEP]i would highly recommend this hotel![SEP]one note- parking is 29.00 a day.[SEP]we took the light rail in from penn station and the station was a 3 min walk away.[SEP]very easy!
1	decent room, although showing somehow unusual settings, with the sink and vanity mirror between the bed and the wall mounted tv.[SEP]great location, in walking distance from everything downtown.[SEP]parking tip: for those who find the hotel valet parking a little on the high side, there are overnight public parkings on the 6th, 2 - 4 minutes walks away.[SEP]in the ace parking across the street at 298 on 6th, i paid $13 for one night, 9 for 2nd, and 11 for the 3rd night.[SEP]the hotel internet connection range does not fully cover the gym area: (there are two treadmills, two elipticall machines and a byke in the small gym area, which can get very crowded in the morning: (be prepared to pay $3/page, if you want to send a fax from the hotel.
1	my husband and i have just returned from a 3 night stay at the grand hotel amrath, amsterdam - it is great and we both really enjoyed staying there.[SEP]the hotel is fantastic, the staff are very helpful, the rooms are clean and spacious and the location is superb.[SEP]it is very unusual for me to be so complimentary about a hotel as i usually find something to complain about.........[SEP]but on this occasion i couldn't![SEP]i am still in shock that the mini bar in the hotel room is re - filled every day - free of charge![SEP]the location is superb it is easy to access the main sites and attractions and the hotel is only 7 - 10 minutes walk from amsterdam central train station - get the train from the airport its really easy and the taxi's are very expensive ; 45 euro by taxi each way 8 euro return train ticket (per person)..[SEP]don't be put off by the outside of the hotel building, when you first arrive i was a bit worried as it is rather gothic looking from the outside but inside it is really really nice.[SEP]only thing to be aware of - it is a 5 * and you do pay 5 * prices in the hotel bar, but then my husband and i found eating and drinking in amsterdam expensive.[SEP]if you want a good meal while you are there i can certainly reccommend the me naam naam thai resturant and the aneka rasa indonesian resturant - both serve excellent food and drink the service is fantastic!
1	great location, close to subway lines and a short walk from all downtown amenities, soho, wall street, chinatown, lower east side, little italy etc.[SEP]laid back but efficient, friendly, helpful and accommodating staff.[SEP]bed extremely comfortable - rooms are not huge but this is nyc!![SEP]fantastic opulent sunday brunch which is a bargain at $29.00.[SEP]i liked the design, liked the vibe ; a preponderance of young - ish fashionista / media types and a sprinkling of weekending suburbanites.[SEP]gets pretty hectic on saturday night in the bar - didn't always want to hang out there but no problem to find plenty of other decent places in the neighbourhood.[SEP]a good place from which to do your own thing.[SEP]loads of great touches - cds and the bose wave player in the room, free bike hire, unexpected and welcome glass of champagne on arrival.[SEP]watch prices for room service and minibar - some of them are silly ($10 for a small tin of nuts?) but - will definitely stay here again.
1	we stayed in this hotel for 5 nights and my husband got the room upgraded to 22nd floor with times square view.[SEP]and what a view![SEP]i would definitely recommend to get a room with that view.[SEP]hotel was good and the location is great.[SEP]nearly all major attractions were close and within walking distance (well, you do have to walk quite a bit in new york!).[SEP]nearly everything was good about this hotel, friendly staff, you could bring food in, good location, etc... except for the thin walls.[SEP]and it became worse when someone would run bath, open tap, etc.[SEP]in adjoining rooms.[SEP]it was so loud as if water was running in your room.[SEP]so other than this problem this hotel is great.
1	i choose swissotel primarily due to the proximity to mrt station - city hall mrt is right below the hotel.[SEP]i stayed here for 8 days, daily commuting between hotel and changi business park.[SEP]checks all the boxes on convenience and location.[SEP]most of the food spots like clark quay and boat quay are less than 10 minute walk from the hotel ; so is malls like hunan, raffles city mall etc.[SEP]rooms facing the harbor provide the best view.[SEP]its quite an experience to stand in the balcony- every room has one- and soak up the night view of the city and harbor.hotel shares its healthclub (willow spa) with another hotel situated on the adjacent building.[SEP]the view from the restaurants on 70th floor is quite stunning.[SEP]raffles city mall, which is right next to the hotel, has quite an excellent food court, as well as a 24 hour mc donalds.[SEP]found the breakfast / lunch options in the mall to be far more attractive than restaurants in hotel.[SEP]really a boon if you want to have a late night bite after serious bar hopping.[SEP]however i found the room size and the interiors to be quite mediocre.[SEP]also in - spite of staying for 8 days at a stretch, there were no complimentary drinks or customer service status calls- something they could learn from premium indian hotels.[SEP]overall a very good hotel ; but did not live up - to the hype!
1	when we arrived at the hotel we were met with a friendly concierge desk that promptly checked us in to the hotel.[SEP]we stayed in a standard room and in our opinion it far exceeded our expectations - very clean, the bed was super comfortable, modern fit out which completed the generous size of the room.[SEP]we were also surprised by the complimentary chocolate cake in our room for our anniversary![SEP]in terms of the location, the subway was a 10 minute walk away and took you to all the popular areas.[SEP]the transport is very efficient so staying a little further out of the hustle and bustle did not bother us at all.[SEP]overall we would definitely stay at the m hotel again!
1	my husband found this hotel for us, part of week long family vacation thru indiana.[SEP]very enjoyable stay![SEP]lovely rooms, courteous staff, good location.[SEP]having a shuttle for quests is great feature.[SEP]my school - age sons enjoyed it, also.[SEP]very good hot breakfast bar every morning is convenient, relaxing, & pleasant atmosphere.
1	my husband peter and i just returned from our second stay.[SEP]we first stayed at his hotel in november 2011, and loved it so much, after seeing a great deal online, we went back in march 2012.[SEP]and everything i said in my earlier review about this hotel being above and beyond all others is still true.[SEP]the rooms are immaculate, pool is spotless, pool bar (nathan v.) was fun and comfortable.[SEP]and customer service is top notch.[SEP]a special thanks to charlene b, front desk manager who is so personable and goes out of her way to accommodate her guests.[SEP]she is wonderful.[SEP]we also met the gm, terry at the pool bar and he offered his services if needed.[SEP](the only need we have is to thank charlene and terry for another perfect stay!!!!!) hotel is in a great location, close to lots & lots of restaurants and only a couple blocks from the disney entrance.[SEP]it also has a great restaurant and lobby bar with happy hour specials.[SEP]the rooms are designed so well with everything at your fingertips, very well appointed and love the color of the rooms, the sleep number beds, flat screen tv ’s, refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, hair dryer, granite countertops and great air conditioning.[SEP]we can not wait to come back a third time....... and a 4th......[SEP]and a 5th... etc.:) we will be back!!![SEP]hopefully this november.[SEP]see you then, kathi & peter b.
1	the location of ambassade hotel can't be beat.[SEP]it is walking distance to everything, located on a beautiful canal, and away from the chaotic center.[SEP]there are great little coffee houses and lunch / breakfast places close by.[SEP]the staff was great in making super dinner reservations.[SEP]i provided a list of restaurants i was interested in and they steered me to the ones they get the best feed back from, so we had fabulous dinners.[SEP]also, they can sell you tickets to the museums so you can avoid long lines (but you must book anne frank's house weeks ahead of time!) plus, we rented bikes from the hotel -- so convenient and very fun.[SEP]as for the rooms, i would say they are charming but some are a bit dated.[SEP]the first room we had was equiped with a nice sized lovely bathroom, flat screened tv and big closet.[SEP]unfortunately the hotel was under construction -- right in front of our room-- and was next to a noisy elevator shaft.[SEP]we requested a room change and the second room was thankfully quiet, pretty and had a great canal view but a tiny bathroom, tiny closet and an ancient tv.[SEP]there are no mini - fridges.[SEP]i am not sure the room was worth 325 euros, but we were still quite happy there, despite having to climb through a construction zone (wet paint, drop cloths, construction workers, etc) each time we went in and out of the hotel.
1	golden park hotel is quiet and in good location.[SEP]its 15min walk to beyoglu shopping area and its near the bus stop.[SEP]take bus 61b to go to the grand bazaar.[SEP]the room, toilet and bedsheets are clean.[SEP]also, the restaurant is now a " no smoking " area.[SEP]the staff are friendly though they have a hard time communicating in english.[SEP]i wish they can serve traditional turkish breakfast also alongside the typical american breakfast.
1	first rate i honestly wasn't expecting much from such a large convention style hotel but i was more than pleasantly surprised.[SEP]the staff was wonderful from valet to check - in to the concierge lounge.[SEP]i was particularly struck that in the morning the staff lined up in the lobby to greet customers.[SEP]getting used to the dial up elevators didn't take much time and they ended up being very convenient... no long wait or floor after floor stops.[SEP]the location was excellent right next to canal street and the french quarter.[SEP]it was a wonderful experience.
1	charming little hotel with great location on the left bank.[SEP]fantastic staff, very helpful and smiling.[SEP]we enjoyed our stay and don't regret our choice.[SEP]we had room 28 located on the garden side.[SEP]this is very quiet with a nice and french classical decoration.[SEP]this is what we expected and we haven't been diappointed.[SEP]as aleady mentioned the bed's extremely comfy.[SEP]we won't hesitate to go back again and again.
1	the location of this hotel is excellent but the rooms were rather dated and smelt musty (as did the corridors).[SEP]we were initially given an inner room on the second floor which overlooked a bunch of pipes and the airconditioning unit was incredibly noisy.[SEP]i complained and they agreed to move us to a room with a view on the third floor.[SEP]we were then given a room overlooking the street (not a great choice as the noise at night was incredible).[SEP]after 2 nights i complained again and was told that the hotel was full due to a medical conference.[SEP]however we returned later and were moved to the fifth floor.[SEP]we managed to get some sleep on this level but for the price we had pre - paid i was incredibly disappointed.
1	we stayed for one night at this hotel and found it to be perfect.[SEP]we found our twin room to be a good size for the price, especially as it had a separate sort of annexe with a door leading to the bathroom.[SEP]the room was very clean and comfortable.[SEP]check in was easy peasy and very quick.[SEP]the room wasn't ready as we were earlier than the check in time stated on our reservation, so the excellent concierge service took our luggage whilst we went off to enjoy ourselves in covent garden.[SEP]after a good night's sleep, as the hotel was surprisingly quiet, we had our excellent buffet breakfast the following morning.[SEP]limited choice for the cooked breakfast, but piping hot which is very rare for a buffet breakfast.[SEP]nothing was greasy, and it was all very fresh.[SEP]the breakfast room had plenty of empty tables and all tables were cleaned as soon as people left.[SEP]we checked out, again very easy, with no problems.[SEP]then for a nominal £ 1 we were able to leave our luggage with the excellent concierge again, whilst we went off to enjoy the british museum.[SEP]when we got back to the hotel to pick up our luggage, the concierge hailed a taxi for us (right outside the door of the hotel) to take us back to the station.[SEP]could not fault this hotel in anyway.[SEP]great location, great service, all for a great price.[SEP]we will definitely stay here again.
1	we stayed at the new eventi hotel the second week of october and it was great.[SEP]it was in a very good location in manhattan.[SEP]the room was a good size for ny, very stylish and the beds super comfortable.[SEP]the staff were very welcoming and helpful.[SEP]there was also a beautiful terrace on the 5th floor with great views of the city including the empire state building.[SEP]i highly recommend the kimpton chain of hotels since they offer the complimentary wine hour every night!
1	i have to say, things didn't start very well as the room price on the internet neglected to mention the tax so instead of the quoted £ 68, we were charged £ 85.[SEP]still, for knightsbridge that was a fair price.[SEP]i made a bit of a fuss and we were upgraded to a suite, which was fine.[SEP]however, the whole place is very tatty and most of the bedroom doors looked like they'd been kicked in at some stage, and there was paint chipped off everywhere.[SEP]we had a nice sized suite with reasonable bedroom and sitting room overlooking the road but that was fine.[SEP]pity it's all such a bodge - evidence of cowboy builders and poor maintenance everywhere - tatty double glazing, dire shower room with mould around the shower tray, surface wiring in places, lamps with the wrong plugs on, curtains not hanging properly - missing hooks?[SEP]- wonky knackered furniture & so on.[SEP]the bed was the best bit, large and comfortable.[SEP]the' extras' were very 2 * with sachets of coffer & uht, no biscuits for example.[SEP]basic dull toileteries, free wi - fi with such a poor signal i couldn't get anything, mini bar sparsely equipped.[SEP]breakfast was £ 14 something each extra for a flabby piece of toast and cup of coffee, so we went out and had a feast in a local cafe.[SEP]in it's favour, we didn't have as bad an experience as other people seem to have done and because of it's price and location, i might even consider going back!
1	check - in process was very lengthy![SEP]we checked in on a sunday and waited 30 minutes.[SEP]we understand that sunday is a busy check - out day, but it was frustrating.[SEP]we stayed in a hollywood hip room and loved the interior.[SEP]bed was plush, furniture was nice, bathroom very large (separate tub / shower).[SEP]the downside to the room was that we were placed right next to the elevator, which was very loud![SEP]i would recommend asking to be moved if you find your room near the elevator.[SEP]buffet is expensive, but we received a bogo free offer with our night's stay.[SEP]otherwise, i don't think it's worth the money.[SEP]loved the location of the hotel![SEP]the only downside to our stay was the casino.[SEP]we had no luck and getting a drink was difficult.[SEP]but, that's what's great about vegas, there are plenty of other casinos to choose from!
1	i just returned from the monte carlo and i had a wonderful time.[SEP]the room was immaculate and the staff exceptional.[SEP]i had a problem with the air conditioning and they corrected it within 20 minutes.[SEP]this included putting a new motor in the unit![SEP]the elevators never had you waiting for more than five minutes maximum.[SEP]the beds were comfortable and the linen clean and pressed.[SEP]i never heard any of the construction.[SEP]if you want another room, ask to be moved away from it.[SEP]i made this request before i arrived and it was honored.[SEP]take advantage of the summer special and you can not go wrong.[SEP]it allows you to use both properties and the pass to the club rok is worth it.[SEP]we had a blast there.[SEP]my daughter rode the roller coaster at ny ny twice.[SEP]the restaurant two for one in ny ny was wonderful but bear in mind that juice was $5 and coffee $4 so you will still pay about $20 for breakfast.[SEP]the two for one buffet dinner was reasonable and there was a great selection.[SEP]the midnight to 6 am steak dinner was delicious.[SEP]i do not know what other people are complaining about because i think this is the bargain of las vegas in terms of price, location, and comfort.[SEP]planning to go back again soon.
1	we had great stay at morgana hotel.[SEP]the staff took good care of us the whole time and our room looked updated and was very clean.[SEP]hotels in europe intend to have small rooms while ours was just fine.[SEP]the location is very good to see rome with the buses, metro and all trains stopping just few min walk outside of the hotel.[SEP]we walked everywhere as the city itself is not that big at all.[SEP]we would use morgana hotel again for future visit in rome.
1	wonderful hotel this hotel has it all for a good price.[SEP]the rooms were a little small but very modern.[SEP]the location is in kowloon and is easily walkable to the walkway of the stars and really great shopping since the hotel is linked to a mall.[SEP]the internet is not free but affordable.[SEP]the hotel offers a car service for about 70 us dollars which is easy and highly recommended.[SEP]the breakfast buffet is amazing and also highly recommended.[SEP]i would recommend this to anyone on a budget but likes a nice hotel in a great area.
1	fun, unique, romantic and economical![SEP]we decided to stay at the hotel cartlon during our honeymoon after reading several positive reviews on tripadvisor.[SEP]were we ever glad we did.[SEP]from the moment of check - in, the service was phenomenal.[SEP]as soon as the guys at the front desk found out it was our honeymoon, they upgraded our room to the top floor so we could have better views of the city.[SEP]from the old - fashioned elevator to the nice, bright, sun - filled bathroom, the hotel is filled with charming details that give it a quaint, vintage appeal.[SEP]the bed was extremely comfortable and we both loved the cozy robes the hotel provided.[SEP]another fun feature at hotel cartlon?[SEP]a free wine hour every evening in the lobby that offers guests a chance to try different wines, enjoy some good music and mingle.[SEP]the hotel also is in a great location, with all the cool shops, restaurants and attractions just a short walk or public transportation ride away.[SEP]the hotel cartlon definitely added to our overall san francisco experience.[SEP]we'll be back!
1	stayed here for 3 nights in october.[SEP]2 adults + 3 kids fit in family room with double bed and sofa bed (same size as double bed).[SEP]clean and spacious room.[SEP]very simple.[SEP]location close to many shops and restaurants.[SEP]5 minutes walk to plaza espanya.[SEP]exceptionally nice staff, helpful with directions and info.
1	great location, poor customer service we booked two days here (prepaid including breakfasts) but got caught in the recent national rail strike so missed the first day.[SEP]we had our card concierge service ring the moment we found out the day before but the hotel refused to refund our money and said tough luck, despite the strike being outside of our control.[SEP]when we got there we found an ok hotel and ok room... great location close to the rail station.[SEP]we rushed around florence and saw as much as we could in a day and returned to the hotel and asked for a box breakfast the next morning as we had to check out at 5.30am.[SEP]again, answer was no, kitchen was closed.[SEP]we complained and were told to go and speak to the head chef ourselves if we had a problem.[SEP]this prompted further arguement which ended when a senior hotel person stepped in and promised to' sort something' out.[SEP]when we checked out we got lillte bags with a biscuit, a bar, a bit of fruit and a yogo.... thanks for nothing.[SEP]value for money?[SEP]no, there are lots of hotels in florence so stay somewhere else that appreciates customers.
1	arrived at the st james early and were allowed straight to our room before 3 pm.[SEP]hotel has 2 lifts which were fine.[SEP]the room was non smoking which we had booked, very clean room with good wardrobe, very comfortable bed, tv with remote control and clean new bathroom with working shower.[SEP]good supply of hot water at all times.[SEP]room was cleaned daily, also daily supply of clean towels and room was also warm.[SEP]the only negative was the radiator which was a bit noisy at times.[SEP]hotel was next door to 2 great deli's which were both fantastic.[SEP]the location of this hotel is amazing - within walking distance of bryant park, broadway, central station, rockefellar centre to name just a few.[SEP]we felt very safe walking around and especially back to the hotel, the hotel staff always checked who we were before walking up to our room.[SEP]we also left our shopping in the room daily and it was all safe.[SEP]we would definately stay here again, ca nt wait to book in next christmas!
1	we were just there for a long weekend.[SEP]the hotel was booked per my husbands company so i can't complain about free.[SEP]we asked to upgrade once we were there from a standard room with 2 queens.[SEP]for $75 more per night we got a suite with a king bed.[SEP]overall the accommodations were nice with modern bathroom, walk in shower and tub with jets.[SEP]not impressed with cleanliness of carpets, but i'm a bit picky.[SEP]we forgot to put up the " do not disturb sign " and got walked in on 3 times by housekeeping.[SEP]our room had a microwave oven.[SEP]the hotel itself is very nice.[SEP]the chandelier is beautiful but doesn't really make up for the cost of the rooms.[SEP]the line to check in was ridiculous but to their credit this was supposed to be a busy weekend in vegas.[SEP]the parking garage is free but stayed pretty full even though it is huge.[SEP]i like the boulevard pool which has nice comfortable lounges and plenty of them.[SEP]the location is nice.[SEP]close to bellagio and my favorite: the miracle mile shops.[SEP]we were on the 65th floor, but had to listen to a loud band until about 3 am.[SEP]i guess you expect that in vegas.[SEP]would i go back?[SEP]i'd probably look for something comparable for less cost since i know their prices are steep.
1	i stayed at the hotel roger williams for 4 nights in dec 2007 (just before christmas) and it was fantastic, i can not reccommend it enough - from the location to the decor to the staff it was great![SEP]i would agree with a review before that the rooms were very hot, but we just turned the heating off, kept the window open and it was fine.[SEP]we were offered to change rooms but it really wasn't a big enough deal to do so (though we appreciated the offer!!).[SEP]the staff were really great, and very helpful, i also found the use of a laptop (at the end of the reception desk) great for looking up little bits and pieces we wanted to do.[SEP]they also have a great stash of maps that i found really helpful, just ask![SEP]we were staying on a room only basis, and were suprised and pleased to find invitations to have a complimentary breakfast during our stay, which we did, and it was really good.
1	the room was pretty poorly maintained.[SEP]the toilet did not flush properly, the sink did not drain properly, the remote for the sitting room tv did not turn it on or off, the shower curtain rod was coming off the wall and there was some mold on the ceiling above the toilet.[SEP]in addition, the furniture in the room was in fair to poor condition (the desk was badly banged up and the sofa cushions did not fit the sofa.[SEP]only one thing kept me from giving this hotel a poor rating, the service was very good.[SEP]the parking attendant was upbeat and friendly and the woman at the main desk was also friendly and helpful.[SEP]but the biggest reason for the great service was the concierge david.[SEP]he was extremely friendly and helpful.[SEP]he knew of great places to eat and was a joy to interact with.[SEP]honestly, david (the concierge) made us feel so at home, that we would consider coming back to this hotel despite the very poorly maintained room and bathroom.[SEP]if the hotel could get it's maintenance together, it would have gotten an excellent rating from me.[SEP]the hotel is in a great location (one block from the inner harbor), they serve a nice breakfast and a happy hour drink (free).[SEP]and the service (especially from the concierge) was top notch.
1	this is a good, clean hotel in an excellent location.[SEP]the decent rate, location, reliable staff and clean well appointed rooms brought us back to this hotel after our first rome trip from australia in 2006.[SEP]the spanish steps location is magnificent.[SEP]as this is one of the most upmarket parts of old rome, the hotel san carlo (via delle carrozze) is an excellent find.[SEP]the metro is close by, taxis are abundant at the spanish steps (a minute away) and one can walk most every where from here anyway.
1	unless you are some pompous person who expects to be served on hand and foot or wants to sleep in satin sheets or complains at the most ridiculous things then you will love this place.[SEP]the casino has an open concept and is usually never crowed, the staff were friendly and the tables were reasonably priced.[SEP]we paid around 600 $each for 4 days/3 nights and could not be more happy.[SEP]if you are like myself and don't expect royalty, like some people on this site (example: i wanted fitted sheets and more pillows and rated the hotel a 2.... stfu you pompous whiner), then you will love this resort.[SEP]for price and location, i give this resort an a+... we are going back in july 2007... already booked:d
1	we stayed here for 3 nights and had a great stay.[SEP]it was very clean with comfortable beds and very nice breakfast.[SEP]the location was very good everything was walking distance.[SEP]the stuff was nice and we had free wifi.[SEP]we well recommend this hotel.
1	affinia dumont was \as good as advertised i have to thank all of you for this trip as i used the trip advisor rankings when searching for a place to stay in new york.[SEP]the hotel was the affinia dumont.[SEP]i never stayed there and was simply going on the reviews of the hotel.[SEP]i can honestly say that i was blown away![SEP]the location could not have been better.[SEP]on 34th st between 3rd and 4th ave the murray hill area offers nightlife, shopping, restaurants, etc..[SEP]by only being a couple blocks from the lexington ave subway it made sightseeing easy and inexpensive![SEP]the rooms were comfy and the staff friendly and helpful.[SEP]i would definitely stay again!!!
1	we arrived in nyc late one evening to see a show and a museum exhibit the next day.[SEP]we got the room for $200, but at the expense of our emotional health.[SEP]the place is creepy.[SEP]the " gorgeous " lobby is more fascist classic than art deco.[SEP]the room was larger than most manhattan hotels and was close to the theatre -- but someone had recently set fire to the bedspread, presumably (hopefully) while smoking.[SEP]i would have run to the busy, impersonal lobby and asked for another room, but the reviews were so awful -- and we had so little time -- that i was afraid we'd just end up in a mildewed, bug - ridden room.[SEP]we stayed where we were and opened the windows.[SEP]there's still smoke in our clothes.[SEP]so, the faint praise: if every single room in midtown was full, i'd stay here again, if only for the location and the lightening - swift elevators.[SEP]but if you have more than two pennies to rub together, stay somewhere else.
1	hotel was fantastic![SEP]just got back from a wonderful stay at plaza lucchesi.[SEP]great location on the river arno, 5- 10 minute walk to the ulfizzi, plazza vecchio, ponte vecchio.[SEP]the santa croce church is just around the corner and worth a vist.[SEP]the room (first floor at the back) was beautiful.[SEP]good size, very quiet and the bed was fantastic.[SEP]bathroom needs updating but very acceptable.[SEP]we loved staying here and would stay again if we ever go back to florence.[SEP]restuarants - try the golden view (just across the ponte vecchio).attractions - you have to go to the duomo (amazing), climb up to the top of the dome if you don't mind heights.[SEP]plazza vecchio is stunning and the ulfizzi was well worth it (pre - order your tickets through the hotel).and shop till you drop!!
1	arriving at this hotel after a luxury cruise was the perfect ending to our summer vacation.[SEP]we were greeted upon arrival (at our taxi, how impressive!) and the reception staff was incredibly helpful and friendly.[SEP]it was very obvious that they were happy to have you there and, rightfully so, proud of their city.[SEP]every time i called room service or reception, i was greeted with " hello mr.[SEP]davis, anything is possible![SEP]how can i help you?[SEP]" i thought at first it was just a greeting but the staff really stood by that statement - which included some really weird requests from me after partying long nights in barcelona![SEP]the hotel's location is in walking distance of a lot of the sites we wanted to see - including la sagrada familia and the torre agbar (the bullet - shaped building).[SEP]they actually come by to clean the room or see if you needed anything twice a day - cleanliness was definitely no issue here.[SEP]as impressive as the hotel is, you'll be even more amazed by the staff.[SEP]everyone of them was engaging and pleasant to speak with.[SEP]this hotel could definitely teach a lot of hotels about customer service.[SEP]standing outside waiting for our taxi, other guests were commenting on how nice the staff was - so it just wasn't our impression, others were equally impressed.[SEP]this is certainly the only hotel we'll ever stay at in barcelona!
1	hotel ala is a supreb hotel right in the heart of venice.[SEP]the staff is very friendly and helpful.[SEP]the rooms are beautiful, large and very comfortible.[SEP]the location, right in the heart of venice, is perfect.[SEP]it's a good value for a hotel so close to piazza san marco.[SEP]we hope to return and stay again.[SEP]i recommend this hotel without any reservations.[SEP]you won't be disappointed.
1	this is our second year embarking on a cruise out of istanbul and our second year staying at the white house hotel.[SEP]this is not a 5-star hotel but it has so clean, welcoming and convenient that doesn't matter.[SEP]the service is friendly and accommodating, the hotel is spotlessly clean, the location is in the heart of the historic area.[SEP]another good sign, most of the staff was the same the second year- and they all remembered us.[SEP]it felt like coming home.[SEP]whenever i return to istanbul, i will stay here.
1	i absolutely love this hotel.[SEP]the service is incredible, the hotel is absolutely beautiful.[SEP]it is very clean and updated and modern, and the staff are terrific.[SEP]the sleep quality is the best i have experienced at any hotel.... the beds are the most comfortable hotel beds in the world.[SEP]the location is perfect, everything is a short walking distance including great restaurants.[SEP]i would recommend, and do recommend, this hotel to anyone and everyone.[SEP]it is beautiful and classy and comfortable and the staff are all very friendly and incredibly helpful.[SEP]my favourite hotel in the world by far!
1	we had read other reviews on this website and on that basis booked this hotel.[SEP]we were not disappointed and could not have been happier with our choice.[SEP]we were upgraded to a room with a view which was a good size especially as we had read that rooms in paris tend to be on the small side.[SEP]decor very french and homely which added to the ambience.[SEP]staff really helpful and friendly despite us locking the safe without remembering the code.[SEP]location nice and central but as it was away from the main street nice and quiet on an evening, even with the window open.[SEP]we would definitely stay again and would recommend it to anyone.
1	good location, so so rooms this hotel is just nice compared to many of the hotels in the san fransico area.[SEP]the doorman thing is pretty cool.[SEP]there is a bar at the entry -way but in the cold months it can be really chilly sitting there.[SEP]the rooms are only ok.[SEP]they need some major updating, especially the windows, they were so old and nasty, i thought i would get lead poisoning just by looking out them.[SEP]the decor was ok.[SEP]this is a great location for sightseeing, close to everything.[SEP]the staff was really nice.
1	first off, great location especially if you have a sea facing room, but heres my first niggle: after a long wait to check in (i was in the vip line as i am a hiltonhonors silver card holder) i was asked if i wanted a " room with a view " for only an extra $20 per day - annoyingly.[SEP]colleagues of mine who are not hh members were given similar rooms for free!![SEP]the next morning we were told there was a 20 - 30 minute wait for breakfast when we could see plenty of empty tables, i.e. they were understaffed.[SEP]but a too small fitness centre where they wanted to charge $4 for ear phones - how annoying is that??[SEP]i much prefer the manchester hyatt just up the road.[SEP]apart from that, no complaints and a generally good hotel to stay in,
1	if booking this hotel, avoid room 108 at all costs.[SEP]this room backs onto an extremely noisy a / c unit and is just off the foyer, so has people passing constantly.[SEP]we slept in this room for one night and had to be moved for the the second night of our trip.[SEP]we were offered no other compensation, despite voicing our dis - satisfaction and this in a city that prides itself in going above and beyond when it comes to customer service.[SEP]the reception staff at this hotel are extremley rude and are not helpful at all.[SEP]infact, these were the only rude new yorkers we came across.[SEP]great location and a good continental breakfast.[SEP]rooms clean although small.
1	we stayed at al vagon hotel for 2 nights.... we looking for forward to seeing venice, and our 2 previous hotels were great in another parts of italy, so we put alot of expectation for this stop.[SEP]wow, we were so pleased, we had a speedy check in and the owner even helped us bring our luggage up to our room.[SEP]our room was very spacious, and had a full size bathroom and fabulous view.[SEP]we were amazed how beautiful the view was and how much better it made our stay![SEP]everything was a short walk away ; rialto bridge, san marco square, and great places to eat all within a short walk.[SEP]even just steps away were the gondoliers![SEP]which you can see right out of your window.[SEP]we really enjoyed our stay at al vagon, they were helpful with all our questions, and the room was spotless not to mention the location was fantastic.[SEP]i would recommend this hotel to anyone interested in staying here and would retun myself.
1	my boyfriend and i stayed here on a recent visit to napa.[SEP]it feels more like a b&b than a hotel when you're inside.[SEP]our 3rd floor room was clean and quiet and even had a fireplace.[SEP]the " extras " included with our stay were great: mini - fridge in the room, guest laundry, hot tub, breakfast, and of course the fresh baked cookies every evening.[SEP]the common room has complimentary coffee, tea, and water, along with board games, books, and 1/2 price wine tasting coupons for numerous wineries in the area.[SEP]the staff was very nice and even made dinner reservations for us.[SEP]and the location is perfect: right off of 29 and just down the street from downtown napa.[SEP]i would definitely stay here again!
1	the hotel offers so much - great location, great facilities (e.g., free internet, printing, lounge, kitchenette in some rooms, great price for a new york hotel) but - the staff need more training in customer service and the lift takes for ever.[SEP]i had problems with my room - blocked toilet / telephone didn't work/ distinct smell of previos occupant (a smoker or pet owner).[SEP]i had to complain 3 times before someone finally fixed the toilet.[SEP]i complained and was upgraded, but the staff didn't tell me about the telephone messages received when my phone was not working.[SEP]a few hours before final check out my toilet was blocked again and so was the only public access toilet in the hotel.[SEP]i was offered another room for my last 2 hours there - nice offer but all i wanted was a toilet!!![SEP]there were lots of unhappy people riding the lifts.[SEP]this hotel offers so much potential, but fails to deliver.[SEP]they need better trained staff and need to maintain their facilities especially the lift service and toilets to a better standard.
1	we returned to the royal playa del carmen last year for our seventh visit.[SEP]we had our particular room available and loved the new lap pool and meditteranio restaurant.[SEP]as always, the service, spa, and resort emenities were excellent.[SEP]we have recommended this hotel to many friends and they have all enjoyed it.[SEP]we have friends who join us every other year for this holiday and they tried another resort, but have since returned annually to the royal because of the great beach location and the fabulous sushi at the asiana restaurant.[SEP]being near the fifth ave.[SEP]shopping and sights is another bonus.
1	had a great stay at the w on hollywood![SEP]location was as amazing as the hotel.[SEP]the hotel is run like a swiss clock.[SEP]the layout, staff, gym, room and management are accomodating and friendly.[SEP]order room service.... food is amazing and reasonable.[SEP]oh a real star hangout too!
1	we liked this hotel a lot.[SEP]very clean and very spacious room.[SEP]location is great, walking distance to many cool places, seaport village, gaslamp distric.[SEP]the free breakfast was excellent.[SEP]the service was great.[SEP]the valet parking was fast, didn't wait very long.[SEP]we will stay again next time!
1	the hilton seattle is located a block away from the sheraton where all the action downtown begins - by action, i mean, shops and restaurants and everything else.[SEP]this location puts its guests close enough to everything yet far enough from the hustle and bustle of a busy pedestrian area.[SEP]granted it is an older property, much older from the outside when compared to other hotels, such as the sheraton but the rooms and the service provided is sufficient enough to make up for the age.[SEP]rooms have been renovated and while it is nothing too out of the ordinary, it is comfortable (albeit, the rooms, and especially the bathrooms are pretty small).[SEP]being another hilton, one can come to expect reliability![SEP]the downtown airporter bus stops at this hotel (they only stop at a few select hotels) so that's another added bonus - there is no need to transfer to another bus to get to your hotel![SEP]all in all, a solid choice in seattle.
1	this hotel is great to explore hong kong, great location!![SEP]i had my wedding in hong kong and chose this hotel, the food for the banquet was beautiful and the restaurant's decor is contemporary - the staff and the food in the restaurant are amazing!!.[SEP]we stayed in the suite and had lunch (yum cha - traditional chinese lunch) in the hotel restaurant which was excellent... lots of places outside the hotel as its very central - the mcdonalds opposite the road is 24 hours which is a bonus as when we were hungry at night we popped over the road and brought the food back to the hotel:) overall an excellent hotel in hong kong - very central, mtr only 5 - 10 mins walk away and buses right outside the hotel.[SEP]public transports in hk is excellent anyway therefore you won't get lost![SEP]only negative comment is that the service at the reception wasn't very good - we waited for a while to check - in and i was in a queue and the receptionists can clearly see i was next however they let a mainlander jumped in the queue rather than telling her to wait which i was a bit annoyed about... by the time i could say something another receptionist took us as she was free by then!
1	the hotel is situated in a very nice location, close to the airport.[SEP]the hotel provides a free shuttle to / from the airport, which has no limit on how many times you take it and runs frequently, even throughout the night.[SEP]the check - in process was fast and smooth.[SEP]i was given a large twin room instead of a single room that i had booked.[SEP]the room was clean and spacious.[SEP]there is a free wifi in the entire hotel, whic worked very fast.[SEP]there are a couple of stores in the lobby area, e.g. gift shops.[SEP]the vending machines for drinks, snacks and ice are situated on each floor.[SEP]the staff is very helpful and polite.[SEP]i was able to leave my luggage with the concierge for the day and was also well informed about the surrounding area (restaurants, local buses,...).[SEP]i wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anybody.[SEP]it is a great place to stay if you need to stay close to lax.
1	myself and my friend have just returned from new york (jan 9th).[SEP]we stayed at the sheraton for 4 nights and i have to say we had a very pleasant experience.[SEP]the rooms were of adequate size compared to what you get across the road at the sheraton manhattan, staff friendly bars were good and its location was great.[SEP]only a 5 - 10 minute walk from all the designer shops and easy access to the subway.[SEP]a fine bar across the road named rosie o'grady's, well worth a visit.[SEP]all in all i would definitely stay at this hotel again.[SEP]we got a great deal from [ ---- ].
1	staying an extra day after a marine corps graduation family event.[SEP]felt very safe.[SEP]easy to find location.[SEP]excellent shopping within walking distance.[SEP]staff was warm and welcoming.[SEP]everything i hoped for......[SEP]plus a cookie!
1	myself and my girlfriend stayed here from september 7th until 14th 2010.[SEP]room is of good size with good facilities.[SEP]good tv, good size bathroom and the air conditioning worked very well.[SEP]the location was fantastic.[SEP]just down the road form the hollywood and highland shopping centre and the walk of fame.[SEP]we rented a car for our stay and from the hotel it was very easy to access other parts of los angeles.[SEP]we could easily travel to the beaches, beverley hills, disneyland anaheim and universal studios from the hotel.[SEP]the brekfast every morning was excellent.[SEP]i went down every morning and brought back brekfast for two of us to the room.[SEP]as soon as something runs out it is replaced, reception staff were very nice and also the car valet people were nice.[SEP]cleaners did a thorough job also.[SEP]free wifi was a major plus aswell as most hotels require you to pay for it.[SEP]it was handy to be able to log onto the wifi on my phone to check emails from the comfort of my room.[SEP]there is a swimming pool available but i did nt see many people use as there is so much to do in la no need to waste a day at the pool but it is good to have the option also a fitness centre to keep the fitness up while on holiday is a great option to have.[SEP]next time we are back in california we hope to be able to stay at this brilliant hotel again.
1	stayed at the hotel eiffel seine for a three day stop over on the way back from a business trip in germany.[SEP]after the hussle and bustle of peak hour paris rer it was wonderful to walk into this oasis.[SEP]the rooms were clean and well appointed and the were very helpful.[SEP]located within a few minutes walk of the eiffel tower and opposite the train it was a perfect location from which to explore paris.[SEP]would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting paris.
1	we stayed in the hotel for 5 days.[SEP]the room was lovely and clean, bathroom was huge for european standards![SEP]breakfast was very filling and they even helped us have a bit to eat at 5 am before our airport transfer came.[SEP]the staff were very helpful with our billions of questions about paris![SEP]location was fabulous, pretty much across the road from the metro![SEP]free internet was also a bonus![SEP]highly recommended hotel for a paris trip!
1	we successfully changed to this hotel when returning to paris after several weeks traveling through france.[SEP]the first part of the journey we stayed around the corner in a ridiculously small room.[SEP]albeit, the competition is nice and offers an afternoon snack with cocktails, this hotel, can not be beaten for its value.[SEP]the common rooms are tiny, so don't expect to come in and put your feet up.[SEP]the " exercise " room is a joke.[SEP]the location, solitude, chic factor, comfort and willingness of the staff to help with anything you need, however, is a great asset to this establishment.[SEP]the club room, based on the previous poster's comments, is the room to book.[SEP]it is spacious, quiet and has a beautiful outlook to the tree lined square.[SEP]we love the neighborhood and there is a great array of restaurants around beyond earshot.[SEP]we did not try room service or breakfasts but the bellman was precious in his efforts to help and the concierge sent us to great restaurants where the locals go... would recommend this hotel to anyone without hesitation.
1	we arrived early and were able to check in at 1:00![SEP](i called ahead) we wanted to make the most of our stay so right after checking in we headed out to explore the city.[SEP]the location is great![SEP]the subway is right next to the hotel, times square is a few blocks away and so is central park![SEP]we purchased the new york city pass for 2 days and made it to so many sites using the greyline sight seeing buses.[SEP]i would definitely recommend planning out your sights then hopping on and off the bus to explore as many as you can![SEP]the bus has tour guides that tell you all about the history of the bldgs, parks, attractions, etc.[SEP]it rained on and off on our trip but thanks to the free rain ponchos we stayed up top and weathered the rain drops to enjoy the tour.[SEP]the parking was expensive since we didn't need the car, maybe next time we'll park it off site a few blocks for a cheaper rate or take the train.
1	wow![SEP]this place was really cool.[SEP]i stayed here with a group on a teen - tour to so.[SEP]california and hawaii.[SEP]i stayed here for six nights.[SEP]we checked in very quickly in the nice lobby.[SEP]my room on the 12th floor was spacious.[SEP]the beds were so comfortable, even the rollaway was quite comfortable.[SEP]the shower was nice and powerful.[SEP]the pool area is beautiful and it has a hot tub.[SEP]the location is great too... right next to a trolley station![SEP]the hotel restaurant has good pizza, but the best food nearby is at seau's, owned by former chargers linebacker junior seau.[SEP]i never had to wait for an elevator, which was good.[SEP]my only complaint was the staff.[SEP]we were a large group, so naturally we were going to make a lot of noise.[SEP]the staff would not stop complaining about our noise![SEP]they said that the doors kept slamming shut.[SEP]well, then get doors that don't make so much noise![SEP]it's not our fault.[SEP]besides, we barely made any noise... it was the people with babies on our floor that made the noise.[SEP]the staff assumed that it was us just because we were a large group and easy to pick on.[SEP]and they didn't tell us nicely.[SEP]they used nasty tones of voice and were very rude.[SEP]but the hotel itself was excellent, so i would definitely stay there again and recommend it to others.
1	just got back from 3 nights at the centurion palace and not sure if it was worth the ratings.[SEP]i booked through expedia into the superior double room.[SEP]initially on arrival the room looked great, nice size, good bed, good t.v.,ipod docking station, mini bar, good lighting.[SEP]it was the bathroom that was the let down.[SEP]there was no bath, the decor was a garish gold colour.[SEP]it had a nice sink and the shower with lights in the floor was just a show piece.[SEP]dont touch the mini bar, ive stayed in hotels around the world and paid some mini bar bills but this was ridiculous.[SEP]one can of coke and two small mineral waters 19euros.[SEP]there are no tea and coffee making facilities in the room.[SEP]there is no use of irons for guests, only an expensive laundry service.[SEP]the breakfast was good.though.[SEP]i saw not one guest eat a restaurant evening meal or use the bar.the location was good but i m not sure i would recommend this hotel.[SEP]and as has happened with expedia booked hotels before you do nt seem to get the best rooms.
1	i originally wanted to stay in the marriott marquis in times square, but due to a last minute jump in airfare, decided for the less expensive holiday inn express.[SEP]the rooms were decent sized for a new york city hotel room.[SEP]everything was very clean and modern.[SEP]the rooms featured the holiday inn express bedding collection, triple sheeted, with a duvet and not a comforter.[SEP]hdtvs are used in the rooms.[SEP]we had a view of the city street below and some buildings.[SEP]very cool![SEP]the rate was incredible![SEP]i would even say dirt cheap.[SEP]i'd say a great value for the price.[SEP]the hotel was in a great location... sort of " off the beaten path " of times square (less noise!) but well walkable to great dining and the theatre district.[SEP]also, it was conveniently located near the pabt transit location![SEP]i felt very safe in the area.[SEP]if you're looking for a clean, convenient place to stay, you've found a great pick![SEP]don't be expecting a mansion for a room, but expect free wifi and breakfast!
1	consistent with what you read... pretty much on par with what you will read on this site.[SEP]the staff is very nice and helpful.[SEP]rooms are small / cozy and as with many places in san francisco there is no ac.[SEP]we have found the nights to be cool enough when leaving windows open.[SEP]the night cap of sherry is a very comfortable touch.[SEP]location was great for what we wanted to do.[SEP]we were able to walk to pier 33 area to the south, fisherman's wharf to the north, and a great restaurant called frascati's to the west.[SEP]north beach is primarily italian restaurants.[SEP]also very close to chinatown if you want to see that.[SEP]all and all it was what we expected and served our needs quite well.
1	we stayed in room c in early september.[SEP]we did our homework and knew this was someplace special.[SEP]the owners and management obviously care deeply for their guests' comfort and the quality of their experience.[SEP]our room did not come with breakfast so we had to beat the street to find it, but we knew this going in.[SEP]there was a coffee pot that heated water for instant coffee in the room.[SEP]we passed on that.... a drip coffee maker would have been preferred.[SEP]i never saw any of the other rooms, so i don't know if i would have preferred one of the ones that came with breakfast or not.[SEP]i loved our room because of the incredible ambience and amazing views of the canals.[SEP]great care was taken to accessorize and decorate it.[SEP]it was wonderful in that respect![SEP]this is a very old, fine building typical of the lovely, historic canal homes of the area.[SEP]as others said, there are some very, very steep stairs to climb unless you're on a ground floor.[SEP]we didn't mind, since that meant we had a better vantage point to watch the boats go by.[SEP]the mosquitos were indeed vicious.[SEP]the management had citrinella repellent out and an efficient room fan.[SEP]it was simply too hot to sleep with windows closed.[SEP]i might suggest inexpensive mosquito netting hung from the ceiling or something.[SEP]i don't think my hubby got one bite, so, no they really don't like everyone.[SEP]the bed was comfy and the location was supreme.[SEP]i'd visit again in a heart beat.
1	i had to go to phoenix for a last minute business trip.[SEP]i was able to get a clean, decent room at a great price last minute.[SEP]the staff was very friendly and helpful.[SEP]the location was perfect for my meeting.[SEP]i would highly recommend this hotel any day of the week.[SEP]for the money it gets a 10 out of 10.
1	we stayed in a standard double room on the 26th floor for 2 nights in february.[SEP]the hotel is a great location for walking to broadway shows, rockefeller center, central park, st.[SEP]patrick's, and excellent dining.[SEP]the room itself was very small ; and as it is an older building the bathroom was tiny and dated (paint peeling in places, etc.) the bed was small and a little uncomfortable, but i thought it was a small price to pay for a good view of central park and the location.[SEP]the coffee shop has a good breakfast menu and cheap wine / beer in the evening![SEP]we would go again, but it is not by any means a " high end " hotel experience.
1	me and my family stayed at the lupita for two weeks and we had a very good time.[SEP]staff, food and drinks were very good and the location as well.[SEP]we didn´t mind taking the shuttle every time we wanted to go to the beach.[SEP]also the beachclub were ok.[SEP]the aninationteam did a lot to make everybody satisfied and the acitivities they held were good.[SEP]the only thing to complain about is that the balcony were to small for three persons, and there were only two chairs to sit on.[SEP]otherwise we liked the hotel so much that we will return there this year as well!
1	we chose this hotel for its great location and no - nonsense approach to holiday lodging.[SEP]it has everything we need i.e. a decent sized, well - equipped bathroom (by hong kong's standards), clean and comfortable beds, and relatively quiet rooms.[SEP]only thing lacking was ironing facilities in the room.[SEP]it would have been the perfect choice if not for the bad check - in experience.[SEP]the counter staff who attended to us was cold and mechanical.[SEP]we arrived an hour later than the designated check - in time but the rooms were still not ready.[SEP]there were no apologies or any attempt to make us feel comfortable during the wait.[SEP]i'd return only if i get a better value on the rooms next time.
1	the hotel itself is at a perfect location, no more than 2 - 3 minutes walks from birkenstrasse u - bahn, and from there you can travel around the city.[SEP]taxi fares to and from the airports (specifically tegel) are reasonable and staff were more than happy to help book them.[SEP]we were meeting out there and my flights were delayed, with the booking in my name and my partner arriving before me, we were worried the she might not be able to check in, but i phoned up and they were very flexible and happy to accomodate us.[SEP]the room was always clean and comfortable although, we were given two single beds wedged together despite asking for a double room, but large clean bathroom and shower.[SEP]our only complete experience of the hotel was breakfast, and although the array of food was substantial there was little hot food.[SEP]in our opinion there could have been options or a set of prices as the whole buffet was quite expensive and slightly cheaper options that might have included half the buffet would have been appreciated.[SEP]overall our stay was very nice and the time we spent at the hotel was comfortable and relaxing, the lounge area is nice after a day around the town.
1	we are a young couple and stayed here in oct 2011 it is a great location, did nt feel threatened being in the red light district, was nt seedy at all.[SEP]it is 10 steps away from pigalle metro station which will take you everywhere around paris in no more than 20 mins.[SEP]the hotel was average if you are not someone with stupidly high expectations.[SEP]it was clean and friendly, room was small ish, but certainly big enough for a couple.[SEP]perfect place and would stay here again.[SEP]we did nt find it so noisy that we were nt able to sleep as some of the other reviews state.[SEP]it was spot on.
1	location was brilliant - right opposite central park, subway leading into city centre on the corner of the street and plenty of different restaurants in the area.[SEP]room was a good size and clean - had everything we needed.[SEP]the staff were really friendly and helpful - even lent us an umbrella when it was raining.[SEP]overall great value for money in a great location![SEP]would definately stay again!
1	i came here due to its cheaper price, and close location to the vatican.[SEP]an excellent, excellent choice.[SEP]i think its location, though some times criticized, is wonderful.[SEP]getting up early to visit the vatican was brutal, but the short five minute walk made it a lot easier.[SEP]it was extremely clean, and the staff very helpful.[SEP]about a seven minute walk from the subway.
1	we love staying here because of the low prices for a full suite esp.[SEP]traveling with small children.[SEP]in a great location for getting to the parks.[SEP]an added bonus to the low cost is the full buffet breakfast.[SEP]this was our second time staying and we would defiantly stay again.
1	quirky but good value my husband and i were in san francisco at the beginning and end of a 7 week trip to us and canada.[SEP]we booked the astoria from australia via the hotel website.[SEP]as it was only 1 star and we had read previous reviews on tripadvisor we weren't expecting the hilton.[SEP]we found it a fun place to stay with a great location.[SEP]it is cheap, clean and in the centre of the city -hard to beat.[SEP]the breakfast is very basic but the hotel so cheap that breakfast in one of the nearby diners won't break the bank.[SEP]we booked to stay on our way home on the basis of the first stay.[SEP]on the downside the towels seem to repel water rather than absorb it and there is no tv or tea / coffeee making facilities in the room.[SEP]on the good side who needs tv when the whole of san francisco is on your doorstep and the desk staff could not have been more helpful.[SEP]nancy on the front desk went out of her way to find information for us, recommended restaurants etc.[SEP]if you want all the creature comforts then this is not for you -don't stay at any 1 star hotel but for cheap, clean accomodation in agood location this one is hard to beat.
1	very close to union square- walking distance.[SEP]very nice chicky room with an additional murphy bed that popped out.[SEP]updated.[SEP]old elevators but cool lighting and ambiance.[SEP]very small bathroom but at that price and location, it doesn't matter.
1	stayed here for 3 days recently.[SEP]staff and check in were nice and efficient and friendly.[SEP]room was " ok ".[SEP]bed was fine but overall the room was dated.[SEP]the toilet would not flush properly and that got annoying after awhile.[SEP]also, the shower was horrible.[SEP]the wireless internet would not work from the 6th floor - a bit frustrating.[SEP]the grill was a good place to go for drinks.[SEP]they have a prime location here - it would be nice if the rooms were up to some of the other westin's standards.
1	business trip, stayed for one night on arrival before travelling to china.[SEP]free shuttle bus to the hotel from kowloon station if travel from airport by airport express.[SEP]fantastic location in the centre of tsim sha tsui, in the middle of all public transport but set back away from main roads, so easy enough to travel anywhere and quiet enough to sleep.[SEP]small boutique hotel without much facility, only one reception staff and a security/ door man, they were both very friendly.[SEP]no problem at all when check in and check out.[SEP]clear and modern interiors, reasonable sized room, much bigger than those in central london.[SEP]comfortable bed, basic bathroom with shower unit, all basic facilities included in room - tea/ coffee, kettle, slippers, shower/ shampoo, soap, toothbrush, tooth paste, stationary, etc.[SEP]free local calls including mobile calls.[SEP]on the down side, there is no socket to plug in electrical toothbrush/ shaver.[SEP]nathan road is just two minutes walk, there are lots of banks, restaurants, shops, hairdressers, 24 hr convenient shops, everything is within walking distance.[SEP]travelling to china by train is also very easy from the hotel, just walk a couple of minutes to tsim sha tsui underground station, follow the sign and walk a further few minutes in air - conditioned super clean tunnel and will arrive tsim sha tsui east train station.[SEP]or take a taxi to hung hom train station for express train to china.
1	good location -- walking distance from the major historical sites and museums and several metro stops.[SEP]near the central shopping district.[SEP]clean, with a gigantic shower.[SEP]there was construction going on in the plaza in front, so it wasn't a terribly attractive setting, but i assume that will change in the future.[SEP]service was friendly but not terribly responsive (our window wouldn't close completely and they never fixed it after being notified).[SEP]my 20-something niece was thrilled because the room came with free internet access and a laptop.[SEP]some folks have complained about nearby prostitutes.[SEP]we avoided the one street with a " sex shop " between the hotel and puerto del sol, and had no problems.[SEP]also, some restaurants nearby (garbo, in the ground floor, and the vegetarian restaurant around the block to the west of the hotel) were excellent.
1	the outside of the hotel was not much to speak of.[SEP]we were very skeptical on arrival.[SEP]the entry and what little there was of a lobby was new although not impressive.[SEP]the employees were nice and polite.[SEP]they always had a nice bowl of fruit on the counter which was a good snack.[SEP]as we entered the elevator and went to our room we were not certain if we had entered maybe a space ship.[SEP]it was very modern, grey, black and dark with blue lights.[SEP]the room was neat and clean but dark, grey, black and sparse.[SEP]there was a computer in the room and a flat screen tv.[SEP]there was no mirror except a small one over the sink in the bathroom.[SEP]the hot water was on a timer so in needing to get up at 6 am the water was cold.[SEP]although the shower was excellent.[SEP]the room was rather dark and depressing and had blue lights over the bed.[SEP]the location was perfect in the old town area.[SEP]right across from the market and mayor plaza with a close walk to puerto del sol.[SEP]there was even a grocery store for snacks and drinks only a half block away.[SEP]the breakfast was good but expensive.[SEP]this property might appeal to men but not especially to ladies.
1	i stayed 4 nights/5days, and enjoyed it tremendously![SEP]the hotel has a very chic decor which fits in perfectly with the east side.[SEP]it was a great location for shopping at bloomingdales, as well 2 blocks from the nearest subway station.[SEP]the restaurant has top notch " free " entertainment with comforting menu.[SEP]the highlight of my stay was the friendly, helpful stay.[SEP]the staff went out of their way to make us feel welcomed.[SEP]i will definitely return!
1	we spent 4 nights in hotel darussaade and really enjoyed it.[SEP]all the staff were incredibly friendly and couldn't do enough to assist.[SEP]the room was clean with a very comfortable bed.[SEP]the breakfast was good and one morning when we had to leave very early for a gallipoli day trip they even opened up the breakfast room at 6.15am so we could eat before we left.[SEP]the location is very close to the major sites (only a 5 minute from the blue mosque) and is well served by lots of nearby restaurants.[SEP]the free wifi was also appreciated.[SEP]i highly recommend the hotel as it represents excellent value for money.[SEP]would have no hesitation in staying here again.
1	i love history... and for me, this little hotel had serious history.[SEP]i was worried at first as i really needed a good night sleep and the boardwalk seemed like it would never quiet down as it was just such as circus.[SEP]a little culture shock when i first arrived ;) however, just like it was the end of the business day, everyone packed up and went home.[SEP]it was kind of funny actually as i fully expected the side show to continue well into the evening but it just stopped all of a sudden.[SEP]the hotel is quite old... one of the oldest structures on venice beach.[SEP]the gentleman at the front desk had a huge amount of information about the area - he was 3rd generation venice beach resident.[SEP]a great guy to talk to about the history of the place.[SEP]also, the hotel really embraces its roots with great historic pictures all over the hotel.[SEP]bed`s could have been better, but they weren't bad.[SEP]location was amazing![SEP]great run on the beach in the morning![SEP]will visit again... thanks for the great experience!
1	the hotel was chic and elegant with a friendly and professional staff.[SEP]though the room was small, it was well - appointed and made good use of the limited space.[SEP]the bed was very comfortable with a down duvet and very nice pillows.[SEP]the only complaint i would have about the room was that the reading lights over the bed didn't work.[SEP]beware of the breakfast.[SEP]it's expensive.[SEP]we mistakenly assumed that the breakfast was included with our room and had we thought about it would have taken our morning coffees and meals somewhere else.[SEP]it was a very good breakfast though.[SEP]also, the internet fee of 5 euro for 5 minutes was crazy, but i had not choice as i wanted to confirm the return flight home.[SEP]the room offers free wireless though.[SEP]i would recommend this hotel, just be mindful of any extra charges.[SEP]can't beat the location either.
1	we arrived to find that they upgraded our room to a king suite![SEP]nice![SEP]their breakfast was included in the package it was continental which had limited but a good selection of food.[SEP]i found their color coded tags on food very helpful for nutritional information.[SEP]their location is very good.[SEP]approx 20 minutes walking distance to time square and to a lot of places.[SEP]we walked the whole time there.[SEP]their lobby was clean and spacious and friendly staff.[SEP]i would stay there again even though i waited at least 40 minutes for a bottle opener!
1	great hotel![SEP]lovely, stylish and in a great central location.[SEP]also, very easy to get to by the aerobus from the airport (5 euros and 3 blocks walk).[SEP]we had one of the big back rooms that overlooked the patio and it was quiet and cool and perfect after the redeye from nyc.[SEP]the hotel is situated perfectly -- quiet but close to all the action.[SEP]and the tapas bar downstairs, pisco labis, became a welcome and easy place for breakfasts and afternoon snacks.
1	across the street from a metro stop, 10 minute walk to plaza espanya for train to montserrat and all major metro connections.[SEP]10 minute walk to cross - town bus to parc guell.[SEP]if you are planning on really exploring barcelona, this is a great location for access to transportation.[SEP]neighborhood is very basic (not fancy), but there was a self - service laundry around the corner (although about 15 euros for 2 loads ; still cheaper than the hotel) ; lots of small restaurants ; markets and bread shops, etc.[SEP]hotel not maintained as well as it could be ; stain on the carpet in the bedroom, walls slightly scuffed ; shower curtains instead of glass ; problems with our toilet twice.[SEP]without those minor things, it could be a 4-star.[SEP]they let us check in very early on our arrival and stay late when we departed.[SEP]staff not large, but helpful.[SEP]we got excellent recommendations on transportation (especially the bus to parc guell, which is across town and not convenient to metro stations).[SEP]also charged for the internet, but we found an internet cafe a few blocks away.
1	if you are comparing apple to apple, by comparing oi suen with the rest of the guesthouse in sincere house or chungking mansion, do go for oi suen.[SEP]oi suen host is friendly, nice and helpful.[SEP]the rooms are clean, with white clean sheets and clean toilet.[SEP]apart from air con, they do have ceiling fan too.[SEP]this is the first time i am staying in a budget hostel and the concerns i had before arriving in the guesthouse disappeared once i see the clean room.[SEP]location is fabulous.[SEP]worth the money if you are on a budget.
1	it was a joy to relax in our room for an afternoon siesta and after a long day sightseeing.[SEP]the soft seating and tables and lamps made a lovely romantic setting.[SEP]the bathroom and huge tub were amazing.[SEP]we had a junior suite with a juliette balcony overlooking the ponte dei sospiri (bridge of sighs).[SEP]we had a four poster bed and delicious breakfast brought to the table in our room every morning.[SEP]it was a luxurious experience.[SEP]the location is fantastic -- 2 minutes to san marco and 4 minutes to the vaporetto.
1	the hilton garden inn was a great location for us, it is very close to the red line if you would prefer not to take a taxi from the airports.[SEP]we walked everywhere from our hotel and enjoyed its easy access.[SEP]the staff we encountered were very nice and helpful with any of our questions or needs.[SEP]the room we stayed in was very clean and comfortable.[SEP]you can hear some street noise, but it is in the city so it was very much expected and did not affect our stay at all.[SEP]we also ate at the restaurant, weber grill, and it was great.[SEP]although it was a busy night, the waiter was very friendly and attentive.[SEP]the pretzel rolls were very good and the ribs were excellent.[SEP]would stay here again.
1	we have stayed here a few times - rooms are comfortable, staff are very helpful and friendly.[SEP]a good location if you have an early flight out.[SEP]the negative is very over- priced food and drinks.[SEP]for example a non- descript beer, two glasses of wine and a appeltizer my husband and i shared came to over $90 dollars![SEP]as we had returned our rental car we ate in their lobby restaurant, this was over $150, again for nothing special and included only one glass of wine, no appetizers.[SEP]their breakfast buffet, while fresh and lovely, was nothing special and was $35 a person.
1	stayed here for business for 5 nights.[SEP]great location.[SEP]good internet and business center who gave me a power converter since i left mine at home.[SEP]got upgraded to a suite so no complaints on the room at all.[SEP]real bonus was the club lounge access but the bigggest benefit was nt the free breakfast or beers but the people who worked inside the club.[SEP]welcomed me by my name the second day.[SEP]they all were super attentive and friendly especially idan (spelling?).[SEP]they had at least 3 - 5 staff members in the club at all times which was mostly empty.[SEP]i suggest buying club level if you stay at this hotel not only for the free food and booze but the great service.[SEP]only thing i think they can improve on is to communicate that they will open the gym if you request.[SEP]i read from another poster that it was closed and was upset.[SEP]then read from a different one that all you have to do is ask.[SEP]i asked at 5:30am and they promptly opened it for me.[SEP]overall great stay and if i return will book here again.[SEP]this is probably the best intercontinental i've stayed in and that s coming from a past was royal platinum ambassador.
1	i stayed at the hr hotel this past weekend (oct.[SEP]2 - 4) for the giants v.[SEP]padres series.[SEP]first, the location is primed, a short two block walk to the ballpark, and at the corner of the famed gaslamp quarter district.[SEP]second, the hotel itself is sweet - this is not your typical hotel - it emits cool where ever you go.[SEP]the rooms are nicely appointed and fits in with the rest of the hotel.[SEP]i also had the chance to use the gym, and it had just enough equipment to fulfill my workout routine, also the bars at the hotel (207 and float) were equally as cool and inspiring.[SEP]in fact, after saturday's night game, half of the giants team came into 207 for drinks.[SEP]the only downer, and yes, no hotel is perfect - was the check in process, only one person was working the desk, and the line was about five deep.[SEP]thought they could have brought someone out then.[SEP]also, i would not suggest this hotel to someone that is, ummmm, you know, old.[SEP]this hotel really serves and caters to a younger crowd... so if you like walking into a quiet lobby, then you might consider another property.
1	stayed for my fiances accounting convention for 7 days.[SEP]the hotel itself was beautiful![SEP]great location walking distance to central park, rockefeller center, and times square![SEP]the checkin / out were a breeze, coincerge(s) were very helpful![SEP]nice shops and even a little restaurant inside.[SEP]view was awesome, looked down and saw all the " crazyness " of the concrete jungle![SEP]room was great tv, desk, and comfy bed![SEP]bathroom was great as well, glass shower, and marble sink![SEP]all in all i would say it was a great hotel![SEP]highly recommended!
1	if you are looking for a sophisticated hotel with world class service, a top rated restaurant and spa / pool to relax... look no further![SEP]even with the substantial road construction currently taking place in downtown miami, this hotel is worth it!![SEP]my husband and i thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and found the location perfect (it's about 15 - 20 minutes.[SEP]drive to south beach... depending on bridge traffic).[SEP]the mandarin oriental is a world class hotel chain and this location does not disappoint.[SEP]it's a quiet property, but has all the elementsyoy would want for relaxation or romance (and was well suited for business travelers as well... there is a lovely restaurant scene just a few minutes drive/ or 20 min stroll away).
1	this hotel was in a great location (you can see the top of the eiffel tower from your room!) but in summer don't expect to get to sleep early as across the road is a row of restaurants that don't close till around 2 am and with no air conditioning you have to keep the windows open.[SEP]the rooms were always made up and clean which was good and you had a small elevator to take you to your floor which was cute.[SEP]however the two owners were unhelpful and gave little assistance especially when asked for directions, restaurants etc.[SEP]there were no greetings upon entering and leaving each day and we had to ask three times for them to book our airport transfer and then that was wrong, with my girlfriend and i almost missing our plane![SEP]the casual reception clerk whose name we can not remember (he called himself kangaroo jack) however was a breath of fresh air.[SEP]he was nice, polite, talkative and unbelievably funny.[SEP]its just a shame he was filling in for another staff member and we did not see him on our last day.[SEP]overall this hotel was good to sleep in but if you come to paris without any knowledge of what to see or do or don't speak french (we did all our greetings in french to no reply) choose another hotel as you wo nt receive any here.
1	the paramount combines the right amounts of atmosphere, location, charm, artistic flair and great staff to sustain itself against tough hotel competitors in manhattan.[SEP]special thanks to nathalie at the desk, and gracias for the dim lights in the elevators.[SEP]my room was comfortable and i had enough room for morning yoga.[SEP]breakfast there is quite good, and the coffee is done right.[SEP]i go to manhattan to do tv, and need a good place to land.[SEP]you're going to hear the famous new york trash trucks no matter where you stay, but the paramount is a good place.
1	we stayed a couple nights here in june.[SEP]the location was fab, just round the corner was a metro station that you could hop on to.[SEP]there is an amazing restaurant down the road, 1 min walk - hotel recommended and it was delish and very reasoably priced.[SEP]the rooms at this hotel were lovely decorated and the bathroom was very clean and spacious.[SEP]the best part was the staff.[SEP]their english was great and we had a problem with our sister missing her flight and they could not have been any more helpful.[SEP]i would highly recommend staying here.[SEP]great value for money![SEP]would use again if i was visiting the city.
1	room - stayed in the executive suite and everything i needed was there.[SEP]amazing views of financial district from my room.[SEP]i find it hard to sleep in other beds but this bed was so comfortable.[SEP]the room was very clean, i could not fault it.[SEP]pool - used the pool on a number of occasion and was perfect when trying to cool down on the warm evenings.[SEP]restaurant - there are many choices in this hotel.[SEP]i liked to stop off in brunch after a busy day at the office.[SEP]when it came to breakfast i liked to go down to the global kitchen.[SEP]whatever you wanted you could get.[SEP]there was a huge selection of food and atmosphere was always good there.[SEP]staff - very friendly and make you feel very important and even with 100's of people staying there everyday they still knew your name, especially in global kitchen.[SEP]location - perfect for work and i was able to walk everywhere i wanted to walk.[SEP]i could not fault this hotel one bit from the moment i stepped into the reception area to the moment i checked out everything went perfect and i put that down to the staff.
1	we did 6 cruises and this was our 1st all inclusive resort vacation.[SEP]everything was nice except the food, that was a big dissapointment.[SEP]we could only make 3 dinner reservations at the resort restaurants.[SEP]the rest of the time it was buffet which was very ordinary.[SEP]when i ask at the front desk if we could go to the sister resort azteca the answer was no.[SEP]location of this resort was fantastic - 1/2hr of beautiful and very safe walk to the center of playa del carmen.
1	stayed here the first 2 nights of our honeymoon in october.[SEP]very accomodating staff and perfect location on the left bank.[SEP]close to metro and several top cafes, bars, and restaurants.[SEP]very nice boutique hotel.[SEP]i did feel it was some what over priced for the size of the room.[SEP]however, then again it is paris and just about everything is going to be expensive.[SEP]overall good stay and we would return.
1	me and my wife have stayed in jerry's motel for 2 weeks.[SEP]great location in downtown la close to department stores and shopping areas.[SEP]very friendly and warm family who are ready to make you feel home.[SEP]highly recommended to everyone.[SEP]many thanks to jerry and nila for their hospitality.
1	i stayed at this very pleasant hotel about 6 weeks ago and finally found the chance to log on here and contribute.[SEP]especially since this was my second enjoyable time staying here... this property has to be the epitome of superior value for the area in which it is located.[SEP]the service and attentiveness of the staff definitely rivals that of any 5 star establishment.[SEP]in a nutshell, they make you feel like royalty.[SEP]the location could not be better for much of what there is to do in vancouver.[SEP]walking distance to stanley park and the aquarium as well as being just blocks from top notch dining and the bustling nightlife of all age and gender persuasions.[SEP]the hotel is squeaky clean.[SEP]about the only negative i even heard of was that you should never leave belongings in your car when parking in the garage.[SEP]the on site restaurant is decent.[SEP]we had dinner there one night which was so, so.[SEP]but, for breakfast, look out![SEP]i enjoyed quite the over the top delicious banana bread french toast there one morning.[SEP]i'm sure you could pay more for a stay in this area.[SEP]but, with this property available and the economy being for most what it is these days, i would have to ask why?
1	we stayed at this hotel for 9 nights.[SEP]we loved our stay.[SEP]the rooms are very stylishly decorated, with attention to detail and impeccably clean.[SEP]the beds are really very comfortable - which is important after walking around paris all day.[SEP]our room was on the first floor and overlooking the street, but it was not noisy at all.[SEP]everybody at the reception was very kind and helpful and they all spoke english very well.[SEP]the location of the hotel is very convenient - if you want to walk as much as possible - like we did - this hotel is very conveniently located.[SEP]there are bakeries and a supermarket nearby, so you can buy mineral water and croissants at normal prices.[SEP]and of course, the eiffel tour is within 10 minutes walk so you can go there early and ahead of the long queues the only minor shortcoming was that there were no tv channels in english and as we speak no french at all, we had to ask the receptionist what the weather forecast was.[SEP]anyway, i would definitely recommend this hotel!
1	this is a beautiful hotel.[SEP]we had a one bedroom suite with a queen sleeper sofa in the living / dining area.[SEP]it was just enough space for a family of 4 with 2 teenage boys.[SEP]the pool area is fabulous.[SEP]it was great having a washer and dryer in the room and a publix grocery store right across the street.[SEP]we did have a disappointment at check - in.[SEP]we did not get the room location that we requested, but got moved to a room that was almost what we asked for.[SEP]over all we had a great stay at hilton grand vacation club.[SEP]i would definitely stay there again.
1	we spent one night here with friends from boston after taking the train in from ct.[SEP]the location worked out well for us as it is such a short walk from grand central terminal.[SEP]the location was central to times square, good dining selections and the subway.[SEP]while small, the rooms are more than adequate, especially for short stays.[SEP]there are a couple of things that could be improved, like the lighting in the bathroom and the lack of a nightstand on one side of the bed.[SEP]there are also nice touches, like the flat screen tv and a new style radio that also had an i - pod port in it.[SEP]the front desk staff were very helpful and the included continental breakfast adequate.[SEP]there is coffee and cappuccino available all day from a machine, but no milk available for the coffee selection.[SEP]there gym is small but very nice with all new equipment.[SEP]we were able to do our check - in paperwork early in the morning and check our luggage so as to be able to enjoy the 75 * day that awaited us.[SEP]we didn't actually get back to the hotel until 9:30 or so and our rooms awaited us.[SEP]after checking out they held our luggage the entire day until we were ready to leave the area for grand central and our ride home.[SEP]i would definitely stay here again if it stays competitively priced.
1	we stayed at this hotel several times over the years and have always been satisfied.[SEP](i travel quite a bit.) we were here on a friday, left for another location and then returned for a long weekend the next thursday.[SEP]they kept extra luggage for us without an issue.[SEP]their van driver (bob) was pleasant and helpful.[SEP]overall we thought it was a good hotel at a very reasonable rate.
1	our stay in istanbul was lovely, thanks of adamar's staff who gave us a very warm welcome.[SEP]they are very nice and friendly and speak different languages to make the guest feel like at home.[SEP]the hotel is a restored building, so you've got the classic style combined with brand new interior.[SEP]amazing views from the top where is the hotel's restaurant.[SEP]nicely decorated in turkish style.[SEP]our room wasn't very big but it was brilliant.[SEP]and, something very important, the location.[SEP]just a nice 5 minutes walk to aya sophia and the blue mosque, and about 10 minutes to the grand bazaar.[SEP]lots of restaurants and shops around.[SEP]we recommend it to everyone.
1	i only relied on tripadvisor.com to find my hotel in paris & barcelona.[SEP]these reviews really helped out![SEP]this little boutique hotel is located at a great location.[SEP]the hotel is very small including the lobby, elevator (2 people max or 1 person + luggage), room, and bathroom.[SEP]i already knew this before i stepped foot in our hotel through other peoples comments.[SEP]the negatives: headboard in room smelled musky and you can smell others smoking if there are any guests smoking on the same floor (i used a towel to stop the smoke from creeping in through the doorway).[SEP]the positives: great location right next to the metro: montparnasse bienvenue (lines 12, 4, 6, 13), breakfast was good (coffee, tea, milk, oj, fruit salad, a basket full of baguettes, croissant, chocolate croissant, cereal), staff spoke english and was very nice and helpful![SEP]next time i go and if i was on a budget like i was on this trip, i wouldn't mind staying here again just because it was close to many things.[SEP]i did request a higher floor level so we stayed on the top floor and with a room facing inward (i was afraid the traffic nice would be too loud).[SEP]i hardly heard the metro line beneath us but that was because we were on the top floor.
1	we stayed at grand pacific hotel from the 4th to the 8th of june, 2010, for 4 nights.[SEP]the location of this hotel is super, basically walking distance (all within 10 mins walk) to the marina, suntec city, raffles hotel, raffles city, chimes (an old church complex turned into restaurants and bars).[SEP]if you'd like you can walk to orchard road shopping area for about 20 mins, or its just 5 mins to the mrt stations and 5 mins mrt ride away.[SEP]the staff were pretty friendly during our stay.[SEP]at first they might seem rude / offish (with a standard poker face) but, don't let the poker faces put you off, if you say hi and engage with them we found that they were usually very friendly.[SEP]the staff helped us with our tours, rooms, taxis... with no drama.[SEP]we also got some surprise discounts from booking tours through the hotel staff.[SEP]i've read ppl complaining about the firm bed at this hotel.[SEP]yes, the bed matress was quite firm but not unbearable.[SEP]however, the air - con.... was way too cold and non - adjustable.[SEP]once it hit the desired temp (i.e. 20 degree) it cut off completely, without any air circluation and didn't come back on unless you turn it down again (i.e. down to 15).[SEP]overall, our experience with grand pacific was a very good and pleasant one.[SEP]considering the price you pay for accommodations in sin.[SEP]this is a hotel with good value.
1	stayed at this hotel over hogmanay 2011/12.[SEP]booked a single room but was upgraded by the very nice receptionist to a double.[SEP]however, i think i would've preferred a single bed with more space, the room was tiny![SEP]the location of the hotel is fantastic, only a few minutes walk from central station.[SEP]the breakfast was standard continental european - boring but consistent and tasty enough.[SEP]the room was average at best, it's clearly had a fairly recent renovation, but has been done very cheaply.[SEP]overall though, it was a decent hotel for the price, but don't expect to be doing anything other than sleeping in your room![SEP]oh and one more thing, the rooms are very dark![SEP]there were three lights in my room, but turning on each was like lighting a very weak, small candle...
1	fabulous location ; easy to get to from the public water bus location is great for walking around.[SEP]we woke early on saturday morning and went for a pleasant walk, catching the brilliant colors of the early morning sunshine.[SEP]large room.[SEP]we booked using best western rewards and received a lovely room on the 5th floor.[SEP]it featured 2 levels with a vaulted beamed ceiling.[SEP]though our view was of rooftops and other buildings, it was pleasant nonetheless.[SEP]big bathroom.[SEP]not your standard european water closet, this one was spacious and bright courtesy of a skylight in the ceiling.[SEP]free in room wireless.[SEP]we needed to call mastercard in canada and our 15 minute call was a breeze using skype and itouch.[SEP]good breakfast.[SEP]a large, comfortable dining area with a buffet offering scrambled eggs, fruit, yogurt, cereal, etc., juice, coffee, etc.[SEP]pleasant lobby to complement the pleasant staff.[SEP]we stored our luggage for free, picking it up late in the afternoon after touring the city by public water transport.
1	my boyfriend and i stayed for one night at the hotel lenox.[SEP]our room was huge and beautifully decorated.[SEP]we were in a quiet corner room.[SEP]the hotel is in a great location.[SEP]just up the street from newbury.[SEP]if you plan on going to the granary or touring up that way, it's quite a hike, but a wonderful walk!![SEP]the hotel concierge was the greatest![SEP]he was very helpful and polite![SEP]i would highly recommend this hotel and we plan on going back this winter!!
1	i was very pleasantly surprised when we arrived at the hotel, the street it's on' avinyo' is long and narrow, and full of great bars, shops and restaurants.[SEP]it's also a 2 minute walk from las ramblas and the waterfront, so really well situated.[SEP]after reading other reveiws on trip advisor, i made a special ; request for a room on a higher floor with a window.[SEP]we were on the 5th floor, and had a window that opened onto a side street.[SEP]it was faintly noisy at night, but it didn't really bother me, as the location more than makes up for it.[SEP]the' gothic quarter' is definately where you want to be, with winding streets and courtyards.[SEP]the customer service wasn't great, but i don't pick hotels for the service, so that wasn't an issue for me.[SEP]we dodn't have brealfast at the hotel, as there are great places further down the street.[SEP]it was also great to have to the pool on the roof terrace for a quick swim after a hot day.
1	my family and i stayed with our two young children over the thanksgiving weekend and had a lovely time.[SEP]the property is nicely maintained with pretty gardens and a great location right on the marina in san diego mission bay, very near to sea world too.[SEP]3 pools and a large jacuzzi whirlpool, all outdoors.[SEP]best feature: 3 waterslides which kids flipped for.[SEP]just be sure to inquire before booking the schedule of when the waterslides are open because they are only open when a lifeguard is on duty.[SEP]a drawback is the expensive limited restaurant options on the property, but thankfully there is an einstein's very closeby right on the marina.[SEP]quaint.[SEP]great for morning coffee.[SEP]the beds were super comfy with the softest sheets as one would expect at a hyatt.[SEP]the only complaint was that our in - room coffee maker was broken and it's ridiculous that i saw a pot of coffee costs $14 from room service.[SEP]hmmm... seriously?[SEP]all in all, a lovely stay and we'd go back.
1	we stayed at this hotel for a couple of nights en route to and from the airport and we found it to be fantastic value.[SEP]the rooms are a really good size with very comfortable bed and separate area for sofa and telly.[SEP]they are well equipped with fridge, microwave, iron, ironing board, lots of storage etc.[SEP]the jacuzzi bath in the first room didn't work, but the one in the second room was fine.[SEP]the location is great and about 3 - 4 minutes walk from insurgentes metro which means everything else in the city is accessable.[SEP]the staff were all helpful and friendly and, although the level of english spoken wasn't great, we got by fine.[SEP]would recommend to others.
1	my wife and i stayed here for a week.[SEP]overall it was a very nice stay, the hotel was clean and the location was excellent.[SEP]everything is pretty much within waling distance.[SEP]i would stay here again.[SEP]pros- location restaurant was good happy hour was great rooms and grounds very well kept.[SEP]cons- no elevators beach was not very good.[SEP]bar service was just so so.... bartenders had to be flagged down for drinks.[SEP]water pressure not good no airport shuttle beach chair nazi got old.[SEP]it would have been nice if we had been informed that beach chairs were free with hotel stay.[SEP]as soon as we set down he was there with his hand out for cash.
1	bed: extremely hard with flat, hard pillows a / c: apparently rome has an ordinance that prevents hotels from turning on the a / c except in the mid - summer months.[SEP]with just one window there was no circulation and the room was stuffy and warm.[SEP]they did provide a fan which helped.[SEP]noise: the piazza in front of the hotel is the location for rallies, protests and other large gatherings, so don't plan on sleeping in.[SEP]and every door that closed sounded like it had been slammed shut - old wood doors with little (or no) sound proofing.[SEP]staff: front desk wasn't quite rude, but generally not helpful.
1	great hotel.[SEP]the reviews on ta have been spot on.[SEP]on arrival there was some renovations underway in the lobby and i think as a result, our room was upgraded.[SEP]the room although quite small, was modern and very clean with an excellent shower.[SEP]the staff were exceptionally friendly, the breakfast quite nice and the room included free wifi.[SEP]on check out at 6am, the man at reception was excellent and took us down to the kitchen for some fresh coffee and crosissant's even though the kitchen was closed.[SEP]we didn't want to cause a fuss but he virtually dragged us down there![SEP]overall my wife and i rated this hotel as our favourite whilst our honeymoon due to the service and beautiful location.
1	my husband and our 2 teenagers stayed at the windrose mid june 2011 for 3 or 4 nights.[SEP]the price, convenience (walking distance to termini) and quiet location were perfect for us.[SEP]the staff was so helpful and accommodating if your flight is delayed by several hours as our was.[SEP]the quad room was basic but a / c and hot showers after a long day of walking was wonderful.[SEP]if you are looking for luxury, this is not for you but if you want an affordable, decent place for your family, you can' beat this.[SEP]we would not hesitate to stay there again.
1	the president hotel wasn't the worst place i've stayed, but not the best either.[SEP]for a last minute find, it was decent.[SEP]it's location near a tube station is probably it's best feature.[SEP]my room was adequate although there weren't any toiletries in the bathroom other than tiny soaps.[SEP]a hairdryer would have been a nice touch too.[SEP]the elevator to the 7th floor (the non - smoking floor) was ancient, but it worked.[SEP]the hotel's continental breakfast left something to be desired.[SEP]it consisted of coffee, tea or cocoa with some really hard toast that sits under a heat lamp, assorted jams and butter.[SEP]if you're lucky they may bring out some fruit or cereal.[SEP]there's an english breakfast available upon check - in, but for the price, i'd save your money and head to the shop over by the russell square underground station.[SEP]all in all it was a great location and the staff were very friendly.[SEP]my flight didn't leave till well after my checkout time and they have a secured baggage closet to store your stuff (for 50p) till its time to leave for the airport.
1	i took my two daughters and a 13yr old grand daughter for 5 days shopping in singapore, we had 2 twin bedded adjoining rooms andour booking included the crystal lounge privileges - well worth it.[SEP]the hotel is not too huge and able to give good service, taking the time to explain things and very fast to get back to you with answers.[SEP]we appreciated the free wifi throughout the hotel and the ability to print boarding passes in the lounge for free.[SEP]the staff - particularly all the staff in the club lounge (incl nora) were exceptionally helpful.[SEP]the concierge was a fountain of knowledge and made all bookings effortless.[SEP]no complaints what so ever.[SEP]this hotel has the best location, in house spa and pool, great food and free french champagne in the club lounge.[SEP]emily gives a fantastic " deep tissue " massage too!
1	hilton berlin is a good hotel in a great location![SEP]you are close by to everything![SEP]it's very clean, nice and tidy.[SEP]check in goes quick and reception staff is very friendly.[SEP]rooms have a good size and are very comfortable![SEP]the spa area ist absolutely great![SEP]rather rare to find in a city hotel.[SEP]only minus point is the breakfast service.[SEP]staff very unorganised and slow, misses on serving coffee or cleaning tables.[SEP]the evening service in the bar is therefore outstanding.[SEP]delicious cocktails quickly served by knowledgable staff![SEP]we had a good time![SEP]overall it's a very good hilton hotel which impresses with spa and bar!
1	i stayed at the agora st.[SEP]germain for 3 nights in april.[SEP]the rooms were quite small, though not unexpected for paris, very clean and comfortable.[SEP]i had room 106 and found it to be very quiet as well.[SEP]the staff are great, i personally witnessed the front desk clerks speaking to guests in french, english, and spanish.[SEP]the location is unbeatable with the notre dame and pantheon steps away and the mutualite - maubert metro as well.[SEP]graeat value for money on a 3 night package!
1	my partner and i travelled from australia and had been advised of the great value of this hotel, and we weren't let down at all.[SEP]we chose this location because we wanted to see hollywood, and we truly could not have picked a better hotel.[SEP]it is close to the main attractions, tours, shopping, restaurants so the location couldn't be better.[SEP]the staff were extremely friendly and helpful, not just on arrival, but any time we approached them, even if we were just passing through reception.[SEP]lovely room, free wi - fi, cable and breakfast.[SEP]highly recommend this hotel!
1	2 adult couples stayed at this location and found the rooms to be spacious and nicely spaced apart so you had your own " space " in the unit.[SEP]the master has a king bed, the other room has a queen bed.[SEP]the beds are nice but not very soft.[SEP]the amenities in the room are great although if you are in a room not on the top floor you can experience noise from the tenants above you.[SEP]there are multiple pools including one that has adult only hours in the a.m. and p.m. which is nice if you want a little peace and quiet while you relax by the pool.[SEP]there are lots of activities including boats and bicycles that can be rented for a nominal charge.
1	great location.[SEP]very friendly staff.[SEP]nice and clean room.[SEP]they have restaurant next door the place you have breakfast, but we didn't go for lunch and dinner.[SEP]we had so wonderful time staying in the hotel and definitely will go back.
1	good location, very nice reception staff more hotel than hostel - like.[SEP]breakfast included in price which is great.[SEP]even if it's said " light continental " actually there are a lot of choice.[SEP]bathrooms were quite dirty and rooms had some strange smell inside.[SEP]close to city nightlife and hyde park.[SEP]costs more than any other hostel in sydney.
1	a great location just off washington square.[SEP]room was small with twin beds that were suitable for children.[SEP]we are not big or tall - but our feet hung over the end of the matress.[SEP]we found the mattresses uncomfortable and after 5 nights ended up with sore backs.[SEP]small bathroom with liitle counter space.[SEP]hotel reminded us of several euro pensions we have stayed at.[SEP]continental breakfast basic and provided within the room rate.[SEP]monotonous after day 3 but other places to eat nearby.[SEP]we booked at the hotel website and prepaid for best rate.[SEP]staff were great except for one lady at front desk who fankly could care less we about us.[SEP]that put a damper on asking for further assistance.[SEP]we would pay more to stay elsewhere in a larger full service hotel next time in the theatre district or chelsea.
1	stayed for a week with wife and son in one club room.[SEP]the room is ok, the bed is super.[SEP]the club lounge is very good with free cocktails and wine during happy hour.[SEP]impeccable service throughout the hotel.[SEP]the internet connection is the room is unfortunately unstable and sometimes even unavailable.[SEP]the breakfast in the olive tree restaurant can be so crowded that you will have to wait in the lobby.[SEP]we tried it once and went back to the club lounge for breakfast, which is already very good.[SEP]the location is excellent with bugis metro station very close and bugis shopping mall and a great food court.[SEP]outside is a street with many chinese hotpot / steamboat restaurants which offer good food at moderate prices, although some look a bit shabby.[SEP]i will certainly come back to this hotel!
1	this was our first stay at the bahama house and we were very pleased.[SEP]the rooms were very nice and the oceanfront room we had came with a spectacular view of the atlantic ocean.[SEP]the staff was attentive and very friendly.[SEP]we really enjoyed the complimentary happy hour in the afternoons.[SEP]the really nice thing about this hotel is the location.[SEP]it's not too far from the center of the action but just far enough away so that you don't feel like you're too crowded... for me, the perfect distance.
1	the quirinale is a lovely old hotel, but some of the rooms, at least, leave much to be desired.[SEP]we had requested a courtyard room, but unfortunately received one that could be considered a courtyard only if that interpretation included the physical plant (trash, heating, a / c, etc) the common areas of the hotel are beautiful and as an antiques dealer, i can attest that the art and furnishings are really nice.[SEP]i would just recommend that you ask to see a room before you actually unpack your bags.[SEP]some are definitely better than others.[SEP]the location is very good -- only a few blocks from the termini station and the city bus stop is just outside the front door.[SEP]i most likely won't stay there on my next visit, only because i want to see what else is available.[SEP]but if this hotel suits your pocketbook and purposes, it is a good choice.
1	i read reviews about this place that left me worried, but it was an excellent visit.[SEP]we arrived early, so our luggage was safely tucked away by the bellhop until checkin.[SEP]our rooms were a little dated and worn, but clean, and the bed linens were fabulous.[SEP]renovations were on - going at the time, but never impeded our visit and will greatly improve the quality once they are complete.[SEP]i look forward to returning after the reno![SEP]staff was polite and efficient.[SEP]breakfast was not included, but the morning buffet was quite good.[SEP]the attached restaurant was absolutely excellent.[SEP]we had most of our meals there and i'd go back in a heartbeat.[SEP]there is a lovely gift shop inside the hotel with all sorts of unique items that i wish i'd had more time to peruse.[SEP]beautiful jewellery.[SEP]location is convenient and nice.[SEP]we had no car, but found plenty in walking distance.[SEP]cabs showed up superfast.[SEP]will definitely stay again on future visits to vancouver!
1	i stayed at the wolcott with my mother and sister in october last year the first few days we had a three bed room, then my sister left and we had a two bed room.[SEP]both were excellent![SEP]it's a little old, but that s it's charm - i found everything to be clean and the staff helpful, though the furnishings were a bit shabby and worn.[SEP]there are free muffins and coffee for breakfast in the lobby which is very tasty, and an internet machine you can use in the lobby for a small cost.[SEP]the location was mind blowing, it's right next to the empire state building![SEP]i think for the money this is a great hotel.[SEP]i stayed at the penn hotel a few years before and it's three times the price and not as good.
1	my husband and i stay at joie de vivre hotels often, but this is our first time here, it has a good beach location, but the front desk crew may have some kind of plan to divert you to a lower priced room.[SEP]we had reserved a premium king ocean view many months ago, but upon our arrival we were placed in a room that was obviously not a king room and not at all as shown on their internet site.[SEP]i was too tired to delve into this that night, but early the next morning, i called the front desk and after an involved conversation found out that indeed we were not in a king room.[SEP]we would have our reserved room by 10 am -- but still by 4 pm there was no room available, at this point i told them to forget it and that i would deal with it when i got home -- suddenly there was a room available![SEP]why we were not in this room to begin with i have no idea as these rooms were not full, is it some money making scheme on the part of management?[SEP]plus we were right under their rooftop bar and a loud loud bass pulsed through the room from 11:30 am until 10 at night.[SEP]i would try their huntington hotel if you want to stay at the beach as their staff is much better.[SEP]i saw many foreign tourists staying here and i wondered if they were getting the rooms they had paid for....
1	i went to nyc for a long weekend to visit some friends.[SEP]normally i stay with them, but they already had guests and easyclicktravel.com was offering a really great price.[SEP]the location was the best part about the hotel - 2 short blocks from grand central station.[SEP]the hotel itself was' boutique' in style, but the rooms were much larger than most nyc rooms i am use to.[SEP]i docked points for service and cleanliness - no big issues, just average.[SEP]free internet![SEP]it was a bit spotty in the room, but great in the lobby.
1	stayed at this hotel in march 2010.[SEP]staff on check in were fast and friendly.[SEP]the concierge and ticket /concert desks were great help.[SEP]they helped us plan our tours and subways.[SEP]you could buy your tickets with them.[SEP]rooms were clean and big enough for what you need them for.[SEP]walking distance to times square, great restaurants nearby.[SEP]subway just around the corner.[SEP]tour buses a few blocks away.[SEP]would stay here again because of it's great location to everything.joanne
1	this hotel is the the first within its' very reasonable price range to appear on the list of berlin hotels and it's very easy to see why.[SEP]it has an excellent location just outside of the centre of berlin within 5 - 10 mins walk of four u - bahn stations.[SEP]the staff are incredibly helpful, friendly and welcoming and the rooms are clean, modern and spacious.[SEP]the breakfast is really fresh with a good choice and a courtyard outside if the weather's up to it.[SEP]the amazing jewish museum is within walking distance as is bergmanstrasse which has numerous restaurants and bars to choose from.[SEP]i would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and could not come up with a single negative.
1	excellent hotel with incredible service and great location because i got such an excellent rate at hotels.com, i was not sure of the quality of the hotel.[SEP]was i in for a pleasant surprise.[SEP]great, unobstrusive service, incredible beds and bathrooms and, in my case, a balcony.[SEP]it was easy to get to roppongi hills, there was a shuttle to narita, the desk personnel were incredibly helpful.[SEP]get a room high up to enjoy the amazing view, it is well worth it.[SEP]i can not wait to return.
1	this was a very nice, clean and friendly hotel.[SEP]it would have been hard to find if not for my trusty garmin gps thing.[SEP]the hotel is not marked very well from the road.[SEP]check in was very fast and we had our room keys with in a few minutes.[SEP]if you come in late like we did parking is tight if there is any parking at all.[SEP]i did manage to squeeze into a parking space marked for a compact.[SEP]the continental breakfast was good although it seemed to be a combat breakfast as the poor starving masses descend on to the free food.[SEP]i used the shuttle service once to go downtown to the market.[SEP]leaving on the shuttle is easy, make sure you check with the desk for room aboard it.[SEP]for pick up you need to call the hotel to get the shuttle to your location, be patient because this could take awhile.[SEP]although listed as having an outdoor heated pool it is closed and the hotel plans on turning that area into a work out room thing.[SEP]the housekeeping staff was very, very good and patient with us.[SEP]if i ever go back to seattle i will stay at the hotel again
1	thanks to the good folks here at trip advisor, i booked one night at this hotel.[SEP]i was in town for an event, so i just needed a place to stay.[SEP]this was a good choice - great location, great price, the free parking and wifi were a big bonus.[SEP]the room was comfortable and clean - only complaint was a weird smell from the kitchen (which i didn't use, but is a full kitchend that was stocked with whatever you'd need to make a meal).[SEP]also, believe the reviews about the noise from the loading docks in the morning.[SEP]it was very loud.[SEP]some of the other guests were a little noisy too.[SEP]the staff was nice and the breakfast was pretty good - basic but okay.[SEP]if you're looking for luxury the hotel across the street would do the trick at an extra $200 a night (for instance, the tv was " old school " with only 24 channels - but hey, it had hbo).[SEP]but if you just need a clean, safe, comfortable place to stay, and you aren't planning on sleeping late, this is the place to stay.
1	this is a nice hotel, and everyone was very friendly.[SEP]it is also in a very good location - around the corner from the empire state building and near subway stops.[SEP]however, we were on the 5th floor, which was not high enough to get away from the constant noise of the street.[SEP]the room was also too hot, and we could not turn the temperature down enough.[SEP]we did not sleep well for the 2 nights we were there.[SEP]we asked to change rooms, but told there was nothing else - it was a busy weekend - but i wouldn't stay here again.[SEP]i paid a lot of money to get no sleep!
1	my family of 3 spent 5 nights here in august.[SEP]it is a great location with beautiful views of lake union.[SEP]it is in a great central location so many attractions are close and easy to get to.[SEP]we were just minutes away from the space needle, pikes market, the ferry service and the great sports stadiums.[SEP]the room was large and very clean.[SEP]it had a beautiful, large balcony with comfortable chairs.[SEP]it has a very nice kitchen area with everything you need including a dishwasher.[SEP]the pool was nice, we used it everyday.[SEP]the breakfast was free with many choices, just not the best tasting choices.[SEP]the staff was very friendly and had maps to anyplace you needed to go.[SEP]i loved seattle and would stay at this hotel again.
1	2 x 50 something ladies just back from 5 day break in vegas where we stayed at bally's.[SEP]despite some less than favourable reviews we decided to book as the price was amazing (booked through last minute.[SEP]com) and as i had stayed in paris last time knew that bally's was a good enough hotel.[SEP]what a bargain - rooms were enormous and spotless.[SEP]bathroom great size and fully equipped with everything you need.[SEP]room was just as good as paris if not better at half the price.[SEP]because we booked more than 2 nights breakfast was included and we had 9 dollars to spend at the coffee take away or sit in bar nosh where the food was great.[SEP]the location couldn't be better and as it is linked to paris you can use all of their facilities.[SEP]all in all a great choice.[SEP]take my advice don't waste your money on fancier hotels after all you are only sleeping in it - save the money for all the fantastic things you can do in vegas!!!
1	my husband & i have stayed here countless times and we always have an excellent experience![SEP]great location, close to theme parks, restaurants, and shopping.[SEP]wonderful service.[SEP]great amenities, especially the pool![SEP]could not ask for a better place to stay![SEP]highly recommended!
1	my friend and i stayed at locanda salieri and i have to say it was the best election we made.[SEP]great location (about 100 meters from piazzale roma, the last point where you can arrive by bus for about 6 euros, otherwise you have to take a water taxi, which costs about 70 euros).the gentlemen at the front desk really made us feel like at home, so polite and helpful.[SEP]the breakfast was great, with variety of food and drinks, the room was clean and nice and also the private bathroom.[SEP]i definitely reccomend this hotel to stay.[SEP]it has the price of a hostel, with a great service and location.
1	its really great![SEP]i stayed at the parkcity on the 20th and the 21st of november, and we were greeted by the super friednyl staff.[SEP]especially the bell boy, who went the extra mile to point out to me where the nearest tube station was.i love the molton brown toiletries![SEP](: and it has a really great location as well, just walk staright down the road and you reach the gloucester road station.[SEP]if you have enough time to spare you can even walk down to harrods as well.[SEP]alothough, my stat at the parkcity was short.[SEP]but i have thoroughly enjoyed myself![SEP](: thank you tripadvisor![SEP](:
1	my wife and i have stayed here twice in the last few years.[SEP]all we look for is a comfortable place to sleep as we rarely spend more than a night or two in any one place.[SEP]as such, we don't normally have the chance to explore all a hotel has to offer.[SEP]our experience is that this hotel is reasonably priced, in a convenient location to the airport and downtown, and is quiet and comfortable.[SEP]the pools are clean and well maintained and the hot tubs are, well... hot.[SEP]just the way they should be.[SEP]we also love the view of the marina.[SEP]the staff are helpful and courteous.[SEP]we will probably stay there again when we return to san diego.
1	i spent 3 nights here with my wife and 2 adult daughters.[SEP]very friendly staff.[SEP]perfect location.[SEP]very comfortable room and bed.[SEP]i'd recommend this property without qualifications.
1	good price, good size rooms, friendly staff, great location, clean and smells well.[SEP]the draw backs are: no elevators (but i think this is typical in venice), they keep their golden retriever inside the hotel (i am sure some people are allergic), we got a two twin sized beds next to each other instead of a full / double bed.[SEP]this is a good hotel, but the bed issue was not acceptable for me.[SEP]still i would recommend the hotel, but would give warning about the bed to couples.[SEP]ps: checking out can take a few minutes so try not to leave in a hurry.[SEP]also the hotel is a little outdated but that is not a problem for me.
1	i stayed two nights at the hojo on lasalle while in town on business, i was a bit nervous about staying there after reading all the negative comments on the hotel, but during my stay i found the hotel to be in a great location, the brehorn pub is right around the corner and has great food and an inviting atmosphere.[SEP]the hotel itself features the cafe luna on site, a great morning breakfast for a supreme value.[SEP]i agree that the hotel does appear a bit dated on the exterior, but i found my room to be in excellent condition, appears to have had a fresh coat of paint, and updated carpeting.[SEP]the doors to the rooms are located inside, so you have to use your pass card to get in, that gave me a secure feeling.[SEP]but the overall area of the hotel is buzzing with activity, the rainforest cafe and many other attractions are merely a 10 minute or so walk from the hotel.[SEP]michigan ave.[SEP]is just down the street.[SEP]the l - train station is about a 3 block walk, i did it toting several pieces of luggage to get out to midway, if going that route plan for at least an hour to get to midway you have to transfer at the clark / lake street station.[SEP]only drawback i could find was the lack of internet service, there are public wifi networks in the area but i could not get on them from the location of my room.[SEP]i know its minor, with so much nightlife surrounding this place i was better off not having the internet.
1	i stayed here with 9 other friends for a birthday over a long weekend.[SEP]el taj is in a great location, near coco bongo (look it up) and wonderful restaurants.[SEP]we had 340-the 3 bed 3 bath beachfront duplex penthouse and 333-a 3 bed 3 bath first floor beachfront.[SEP]the atmosphere is quiet, sophisticated and exclusive -- not like one of the huge hotels nearby.[SEP]the condos are furnished with high - quality, tasteful furniture with very comfortable beds.[SEP]we had 2 private terraces that overlooked the beach and the hotel stocked our fridge upon request with drinks, fruit, yogurt, etc.[SEP]eric and daniel at the front desk arranged everything from a suprise birthday cake to a chef - prepared meal at our condo.[SEP]the beachfront restaurant, indigo, was staffed by hard - working, always smiling gentlemen.[SEP]they were quick to deliver a drink, put up an umbrella or offer a menu.[SEP]there is only one thing that i would change: there are boats docked on the beach right in front of the hotel so you don't have the unobstructed view of the water and one has to walk down a ways to get into the water.[SEP]i really wouldn't change anything else.
1	needs new windows!!!![SEP]my husband and i with 2 children went to much needed vacation this january, 2008.[SEP]we liked the view from our room and everything was decent but at night we could not sleep.[SEP]the room doesn't have solid windows -- they are a 2-inch glass blinds that do not block any noise and hotel located on a very, very busy street with a busy bus line.[SEP]we all used earplugs but that did not help at all because the noise level was too high.[SEP]the only sleep you can get was between 2 am to 5 am and that's it.[SEP]i developed insomnia and i still have problems with my sleep 5 months later after so called vacation.[SEP]we will never stay there again and warn others unless they do major remodel with changing windows to solid ones.[SEP]those glass blinds will only work in a very quiet location but there it seemed like we were sleeping on a very busy street.
1	we chose this hotel based on the reviews on tripadvisor and it didn't disappoint.[SEP]it's 5 minutes walk from a metro station and within walking distance to musee rodin, invalides, musee d'orsay and if you are inclined, you can even walk to avenue de champs elysees.[SEP]checking in was fast and fuss - free and the staff were always friendly and pleasant.[SEP]our room was spacious for paris's standards and i loved that it is in a quiet neighbourhood.[SEP]the little courtyard in front of the hotel is lovely too though we didn't get to use it since we visited in winter.[SEP]only problems we had was the heater was not warm enough and we were left shivering in the middle of the night.[SEP]there was also no kettle in the room but the hotel obliged by sending hot water up to the room when we requested.[SEP]all in all, it's a good hotel in a great location.[SEP]i'd certainly stay here again if i ever chose to paris again.[SEP]two thumbs up:)
1	this hotel has a great location and it has its value for the money we paid.[SEP]but i just could nt believe how unfriendly the receptionist at night time was.[SEP]he could nt be bothered in saying good evening, and would make bad faces when you asked for the key to your room.[SEP]he is the most disagreeable looking person i ve ever seen working in a reception.[SEP]even though, there was another guy during the day, he was really helpful and lovely, i could not understand the big difference between them.[SEP]if you are going to this hotel beware the ogre at night time!
1	i choose this location for our three couples for three nights due to the location and hilton brand.[SEP]the hotel could not been more conveniently located for our stay for the essence music festival.[SEP]it was a 1/2 mile walk to the superdome, 1/2 mile to bourbon street, 1/2 mile to casino and 3/4 mile walk to convention center and riverwalk with many good restaurants within that 1/2 mile radius.[SEP]it proved to be very important because it was tough getting cabs with all the people in town.[SEP]the three rooms we had on the 12th floor were roomy and very clean.[SEP]very surprised with the quietness at the hotel each night.[SEP]the staff throughout were very responsive.[SEP]will definitely stay there when the steelers go to the superbowl next year.[SEP]mattress could have been more comfortable.
1	i spent 2 days in paris at this hotel.[SEP]the location is fabulous, close to wonderful restaurants and a 3 block walk to the champs.[SEP]the front desk was so helpful, especially when my luggage did not arrive with my plane.[SEP]the wifi was great.[SEP]the bathroom was huge and the best of my stay in the country.
1	we stayed in this hotel for 2 nights.[SEP]check - in took a very long time, however, we were given a free upgrade to a deluxe room, which made up for it![SEP]rooms: the deluxe room was spacious and clean.[SEP]as someone mentioned previously, the beds are very comfortable.[SEP]my room was facing the singapore flier area, which was wonderful in the night![SEP]the only problem with our room was that the safe was not working, however i just hid most of the valuables around the room and the problem was sorted out after we left.[SEP]location: not so convenient if you wish to be in the orchard rd area, however the chinatown mrt is literally across the road, so it's not too much of a hassle.[SEP]clarke quay is approx a 10 min walk from the hotel, so there are lots of restaurants and shops nearby.[SEP]i didn't stay in the hotel long enough to rate interactions with staff, however it was perfect for a short stay.
1	greatly enjoyed the stay at grandview.[SEP]the unit was perfect for two people and was very well equiped with basic kitchen goods.[SEP]our first time to las vegas and really liked being close but not too close to the strip.[SEP]good location for seeing other sights (hoover dam, red rock canyon and grand canyon, etc).[SEP]south point casino next door was fun.[SEP]only negative, do not use house phone for long distance calls.[SEP]made three calls of less than 1 minute and was charged by cti to credit card almost $50 for three calls.[SEP]i think that resort should have told quests about long distance charges.[SEP]other than phone rip off, i would stay again at grandview resort.
1	my wife and i stayed here for her birthday.[SEP]the location is great as you are on the monorail.[SEP]the convenience if not having to hike to a monorail station can not be overstated.[SEP]the hotel is enormous, but i didn't find it difficult to navigate.[SEP]our room was big and very nice.[SEP]the pool area is great with a lazy river.[SEP]we had a great trip and would stay here again
1	after reading many reviews on here i chose this hotel for a 2 night stay for my girlfriends birthday.[SEP]the reviews on here were very good so my expectations were very high and i must say i was not dissapointed.[SEP]the location was very close to the main station and very central to all the main attractions.[SEP]the staff at the hotel were very helpful and were happy to chat to you to help out with anything.[SEP]we even called down on the sunday to ask if the local supermarket would be open still at 7 pm, they even offered to send someone to get us something if we needed.[SEP]the hotel was very clean and the breakfast was top draw.[SEP]the only fault was that our room faced a fire exit stairway, but that's the only negative.[SEP]couldn't recommend this hotel enough!
1	bally's is great value for money.[SEP]its location in the heart of the strip allows acess to all the main casinos.[SEP]we had a room in the north tower with a king bed.[SEP]it was clean and serviced very well every day.[SEP]bally's might be a little bit older but is still in good condition.[SEP]its not going to be as plush as bellagio but your are not going to have the cost either.
1	this is not the plaza... but the price is right and the location is fabulous!![SEP]it is a very walkable neighborhood with fun shopping in chinatown and eating in little italy.[SEP]the subway is right down the block for access to the whole of manhattan.[SEP]the subway ride to 42th street broadway shows is 5 " away.[SEP]it is a easy subway ride to coney island to check it out.[SEP]it's close enough to walk to ground zero.[SEP]the rooms are so - so... who cares?[SEP]have a great breakfast at baltazar then go for a walk over the brooklyn bridge... then explore all the nyc sights..[SEP]the staff was wonderful and extremely helpful.[SEP]i would definitely stay here again
1	stayed for a week with my husband and 7 year old son.[SEP]this is our second stay and i will def be back.[SEP]the whole resort is super clean and all the staff are super friendly, especially denise and eldon![SEP]you can't beat this place for location, you are right around the corner from all the disney parks.[SEP]you can see the tree of life at animal kingdom from the parking lot.[SEP]i can't say enough positive things about this place... exceeds my expectations.
1	great location.[SEP]this hotel / motel is located in the middle of the city which occomodated my busy travel schedule.[SEP]clean rooms.[SEP]most importantly great customer service.[SEP]i was checked into my room by william with very welcoming service.[SEP]i'll definitely come back!
1	we stayed at this hotel as part of our honeymoon vacation.[SEP]we had never visited san diego before, and opted a hotel in the center of town.[SEP]the sofia is in a great location![SEP]close to 5th and 6th streets which have 100s of restaurants to choose from.[SEP]its also close to a great mall if you are looking to do a little shopping.[SEP]the hotel itself was clean, and looked well kept.[SEP]the staff were friendly, and actually looked like they wanted to help![SEP]the rooms were pretty small compared to other places i have stayed, but they were tidy, well kept, and modern.[SEP]this was the only downside to the hotel actually.[SEP]they offered free internet in the reception, as well a great restaurant / bar.[SEP]we would stay at the sofia again!
1	i've stayed in lots of 5 * hotels but this is something special.[SEP]it's not big, brash, flashy ; rather, it's elegant, very comfortable, the service is fantastic (no, really fantastic) and i would really recommend it.[SEP]great location on via veneto and the rooms are really comfortable and with a real air of calm.[SEP]the restaurant for dinner was lovely but breakfast was only ok (cold scrambled eggs!).[SEP]the bar was lovely.[SEP]i'd highly recommend it.
1	this hotel in vieux montreal describes itself as a boutique but if is closer to a full service hotel as it offers room service, has a fitness centre and spa, is attached to meeting rooms, has two restaurants and bars.[SEP]the building is three historic buildings and thus the rooms vary in size and layout but they all appear to offer mice modern appointments and amenities.[SEP]the standard king we stayed in was quite roomy.[SEP]the only complaint about the room was the lack of a coffee maker which we find more convenient than calling room service or going out to one of the many nearby coffee shops.[SEP]the location is excellent for walking around old montreal, a 10 minute walk to place des beaux arts and a little further to the main downtown area.[SEP]we found the hotel staff to be very pleasant and helpful.[SEP]because we were attending for a conference, we received a very reasonable rate for the room.[SEP]i would certainly consider staying there again.
1	i think the hotel opera is best noted for its convenient location and its value.[SEP]service was quite good.[SEP]breakfast hours are long, which is great for accommodating different types of travelers and their schedules.[SEP]i didn't appreciate that the " double room " was two separate beds pushed together, and i didn't love the open shower (it got a bit chilly).[SEP]but the room was absolutely adequate and worth the cost.
1	we got to this hotel on 27 dec 06 and were quite surprised with the size of the room we were given (901), had a double bed and a bunk bed!!![SEP]there was myself, hubby and daughter (8).[SEP]a quite big room and bathroom was clean, with clean bed sheets.[SEP]noisy heating though the first night, the radiators were hissing and pipes banging like everyone says, but it was too hot in the room, so turned off the hissing, although banging still occured.[SEP]on new yrs eve, it began to rain and when we woke up, the carpet was soaked!!![SEP]we told the reception, and as it was only on one side, we were willing to stay in that room as we only had one more night left.[SEP]but the staff changed our room and this room was much nicer, bathroom was cleaner and bigger than our other one, room was smaller but seemed to have a better feel.[SEP]typical, only there for 1 night!![SEP]nevermind, all in all, for the price we paid, can not complain really, the hotel is in a good location, is very clean, fresh towels and sheets everyday, subway is easy to hand and lovely central park opposite.[SEP]downtown is not far at all.[SEP]however, i also agree with everyone else, do not get ripped off by hotel taxis!!![SEP]they are a rip off, we took it back to the airport, but yellow cabs are best, at least you know what you gon na pay.
1	the renaissance amsterdam has a great location near the train station, close to tram lines, and within walking distance to several main attractions.[SEP]we used the hotel as a home - base for 5 days of intense sight - seeing, so i can't rate based on ammenities.[SEP]the hotel was clean, classy, and busy over the easter weekend.[SEP]we had the included breakfast every morning and the buffet staff was helpful when we asked.[SEP]our room wasn't ready when we arrived early, so they locked our luggage in a room for us and retrieved it when we asked for it.[SEP]would i expect more from a renaissance or even a residence inn in the us... of course![SEP]but this is europe... amsterdam.[SEP]i would recommend this hotel to my friends.
1	planet hollywood is in a perfect location on the strip.[SEP]it's in the middle and has it's own shopping mall.[SEP]the really only complaint i had with it was you could tell it was another themed hotel and one time, left over remants in our room wouldn't allow us to forget.[SEP]the other thing was it was a very dark hotel.[SEP]after visiting and staying in many other's i felt i was in the bat cave?[SEP]i like bright area's to make sure i can see if everything is clean.[SEP]not dark.[SEP]the pool was in a terrible place and if you weren't out there at 9 am when it opened forget having a chair located at the pool.[SEP]you'll be stuck in the middle with only a chair and a walk to get refreshed while everyone stares and you wondering why you were so stupid and didn't arrive earlier.
1	the location of the excelsior in causeway bay is its main attraction for me.[SEP]it is close to the mtr, plenty of buses to stanley etc., the trams, plenty of shops and the nightlife area of wanchai, besides having a wonderful harbour front position.[SEP]the hotel itself is very efficient with excellent service.[SEP]the rooms are very small but contain everything you need.[SEP]they could, however, do with a little bit of a modernization.[SEP]the bathrooms are minuscule but again are well equipped.[SEP]some rooms have terrible views of the world trade centre building next door, so avoid these if possible.[SEP]there is a good health club, but no swimming pool.[SEP]the dickens bar downstairs is a good place to start your evening and serves great pub grub.[SEP]if the rooms were updated this hotel would definitely receive 5 stars from me.[SEP]in the meantime it is still my favourite hotel in hong kong.
1	hi my sister (both in our early 40's) and 14 year old nephew stayed here 4/26 - 4/30.[SEP]it was my nephew's spring break and the hotel was only 50% occupied.[SEP]our room was not ready when we got there.[SEP]tara who checked us in was very friendly and helpful.[SEP]they held our luggage and we then went to the beach club for some lunch.[SEP]everyone at the hotel went out of their way to make sure we were happy.[SEP]even calling us by our names right away.[SEP]the room was spacious and clean.[SEP]beds very comfortable and the linens soft.[SEP]we did have a problem with the towels being very hard and worn.[SEP]the velvet lounge was very cool and great for late night drinks.[SEP]the best part of these loews hotels is the location and the fast pass keys you use at universal & ioa.[SEP]the walk from the hotel to the parks is wonderful.[SEP]they really take care of the landscaping and everything is breathtaking to look at.[SEP]we never did take the boats over to the park.[SEP]the walk itself is only 5 minutes.[SEP]i would highly recommend this hotel for families with older kids.[SEP]we did not do disney and did not miss it either.[SEP]the hotel is pricey........ but it is vacation!![SEP]have fun!!
1	wouldn't have noticed this place on the other travel sites so i'm glad trip advisor readers pointed it out.[SEP]got the lowest rate by booking directly with the hotel.[SEP]beds were comfy, staff was friendly (with one warning: the concierge was wrong about everything).[SEP]we accepted a low floor room with no view because it was ready for a very early check - in and i was glad to have the option.[SEP]perfect location - and do try the bakeries in grand central station, i'm still dreaming of their almond croissants...
1	we just spent 9 days at this hotel and it was wonderful.[SEP]very comfy and clean.[SEP]the staff was really nice.[SEP]we were on the 4th floor, in a corner room.[SEP]it was dark, but it really didn't bother me.[SEP]you can easily go out to the roof top patio and enjoy the sun.[SEP]the bed was comfortable.[SEP]you can't beat the location.[SEP]just a half block from the best beach and a half block from 5th, but still very quiet.[SEP]wal - mart is walking distance as well.[SEP]i would say the only negative is that it when it rained, there was a constant dripping sound outside the window.[SEP]it was very loud, it echoed.[SEP]it would not have been a problem except that it rained 4 days in a row!
1	stayed one night in the empire hotel.[SEP]it is what we expected - a hip atmosphere with a great bar and rooftop bar.[SEP]the cocktails were delicious - named for the gossip girl characters - i loved the " s " a mixture of vodka, champagne, and lemon juice - yum![SEP]while the decor is hip, it is very dark and on closer look it is very apparent that this is an old hotel that has been updated superficially.[SEP]the rooms are very small, but nice.[SEP]the robes are frete.[SEP]the bathroom was so tiny - i'm 5'2 and it still felt cramped.[SEP]no room for my toiletries bag - or a trashcan.[SEP]great location - right next to lincoln center.[SEP]all in all, just fine for our one night stay and i was happy with our experience.
1	we were in paris last week and stayed at the hotel eiffel seine.[SEP]though not the ritz, this place was wonderful.[SEP]the staff was superb and helped with my extremely limited french.[SEP]i was sick the first day and they were very supportive.[SEP]the rooms, although small by american standards were clean, up to date.[SEP]i love the fact that they are " going green " with their lighting and love the art noveau decor - very parisian.[SEP]the location is perfect - across from the train, around the corner from the eiffel tower, near several cafes and down the street from the world famous polaine bakery.[SEP]they serve breakfast in a downstair area or room service at extra cost.[SEP]we were too busy to eat![SEP]couldn't ask for more!!!
1	dark halls, dark carpeting, dark wallpaper, phonebooth size shower, three 25 watt light bulbs in room, insufficient light in bathroom to put on makeup, l - shaped room so small there wasn't enough room for me and my suitcase at the same time, narrow hallways.[SEP]frozen in time in the 1950s.[SEP]the people across the hall showed me their room (a double) and it was about 10 sq.ft.[SEP]bigger.[SEP]same 25 watt bulbs.[SEP]good location, decent breakfast, moderately comfortable bed, uncomfortable pillow.[SEP]the worst hotel experience i have ever had in rome since i first started going there in 1984.[SEP]i left after one night.
1	probably the savest neighbourhood there is![SEP]located right between the turkish and german embassy, streets guarded by fully armoured army soldiers.[SEP]the hotel is simple but convenient and clean.[SEP]this down - to - earth family run establishment offers a good functioning ac, a fridge, and a tv with intl stations.[SEP]the house's daughter speaks good english and is glad to give recommendations.[SEP]there's no breakfast but you have an internationally run breakfast café (yellow café) right around the corner where you can get everything from fried beans with bacon to a fitness muesli and fresh fruit for a reasonable price.[SEP]the location is 10 minutes walking to termini station and piazza della repubblica from where all major buslines depart.[SEP]during the week, the taxiride from hotel katty to al major sights (colosseum, trevi fountain, forum romanum, etc) is within the 6 euros range, on weekend this is slightly higher and only if you don't forget to advise the driver to turn on the taximeter ;-) we stayed with 4 persons in 2 rooms and had a good time.[SEP]our recommendation as a basis to explore beautiful rome!
1	we had a nice stay here.[SEP]it was our third choce as our top two were booked - we waited to long to book.[SEP]breakfast was adequate but of our 3 mornings there only once did they refill the scrambled eggs and for a breakfast that runs 3 hours at 9 am re filling eggs should be standard.[SEP]modern decor.[SEP]didn't expect the circus colors of the walls.[SEP]not traditional venetian decorating.[SEP]hated the bathroom.[SEP]obviously designed by a man.[SEP]not place to dry a towel or place your toiletries.[SEP]why is this an issue in so many hotels??[SEP]is a shelf or a towel bar too much to ask.[SEP]not even a shelf in the shower for soap / shampoo / razor??i get form but a little function goes a long way towards enhancing a hotel experience.[SEP]easy to reach - riva de biasio stop on the vaporetto.[SEP]take a left off that make a right at the wall.[SEP]hotel is on your right at the small tree out front.[SEP]easy location with bags.[SEP]also easy to get to burano / murano / torecello - take the 52 from rivio de biaso stop to fondamente nuova then the 42 to murano or burano.[SEP]from burano then an easy transfer to the # 12 vaporetto to torcello.[SEP]a 45 minute trip vs an hour + a half plus if you leave from san marco and take the ln to punta sabbion and then transfer again.[SEP]room was clean & hotel was well maintained.[SEP]i would recommend.
1	best value in downtown i'm a local san franciscan and i've stayed at this hotel twice.[SEP]i love it - it's simple, modest and incredibly cheap (around $100/night) for the location.[SEP]the rooms have comfortable beds, free internet access, and a sort of shabby victorian decor - charming oil paintings on the wall, etc.[SEP]just one block from public transit and short walks from everywhere you want to be in sf.[SEP]parking garage costs $30/day (average for the area).
1	i took a weekend trip with my infant son and mother to seattle and enjoyed the central location of the sheraton for shopping and fine dining.[SEP]our request for a room on a high floor was taken care of, as was the availability of a crib.[SEP]the lobby is beautiful with modern furniture and lighting, along with many beautiful orange flowers.[SEP]the hotel bar was cozy and comfortable for an evening drink on the sofa or a variety of other seating configurations.[SEP]we walked to the malls, major department stores, pike place market, and pioneer square.[SEP]the bedding is very comfortable, the bathroom was redone in all modern materials, and the artwork was pleasing.[SEP]we even got a paper delivered on sunday morning.
1	the hotel's location could not be better - a few minutes from times square and the rockerfeller centre and close to several subway stations, but remarkably quiet.[SEP]there are plenty of good restaurants close - by, particularly on 9th avenue, a 10 minute walk away, and little brazil just up west 46th.[SEP]the staff are courteous and helpful while the rooms are reasonably large and well equipped - large plasma screen tvs, comfortable beds and good bathrooms.[SEP]the breakfast is a good way to start the day - cereals, yoghurt, beigels, do - nuts - though the small breakfast - room can get crowded at peak times.[SEP]given the relatively low cost of the rooms, i can not imagine better value for money in such a brilliant location right at the centre of everything new york has to offer.
1	stayed here in late november for 4 nights.[SEP]chose the hotel based on the review posted in tripadvisor.[SEP]these reviews were spot on![SEP]i was placed in room 105.[SEP]although not overlooking the grand canal, i was not disappointed.[SEP]the room was spacious - considering the size of the rooms i have stayed in other italian hotels.[SEP]the bathroom was large by most standard.[SEP]the decor was modern and room facilities top class.[SEP]the location was perfect - far away from the noisy st marks square but close enough for a leisurely walk.[SEP]the valporetto stop of c'daro is just around the corner for the longer trips.[SEP]breakfast was a bit of a disappointment though.[SEP]the variety perhaps can be better improved.[SEP]however the free cocktail evening was a novel idea.[SEP]overall i would definitely recommend the hotel
1	i and my husband stayed at this hotel in late march 2008.[SEP]ok, the hotel is not a luxyry establishment, but is great value when it comes to location and price per night![SEP]the room was a nonsmoking room, clean and the staff very polite and helpful.[SEP]they have parking just outside the door, which is free for hotel guets.[SEP]you can buy brekfast in the small shop next doors.[SEP]from this hotel it is vey easy to drive to balboa park, the zoo and sea world.[SEP]the gaslight district is within walking distance![SEP]the only con is the closest quarters: it is a bit dark during the evenings, but we never felt uneasy.[SEP]also, ask to get a room * not * facing the highway.[SEP]otherwise, bring earplugs.
1	this is a superior hotel offering a great location for a reasonable price.[SEP]those who are travelling with others might find the rooms small, but the riverside view from my room on the 38th floor (arranged at check - in) more than made up for this.[SEP]anyone visiting chicago for the sights would appreciate the view of downtown, stretching to sears tower, the field museum, lake michigan and beyond.[SEP]great food is available from the small bistro on the ground floor, and all requests to front desk staff were very cheerfully accommodated.[SEP]maid service was of the highest standard.[SEP]i would stay here again without a moment's hesitation and would recommend this hotel to anyone.
1	this was a five star place in southern cal.[SEP]if you are visiting family in the service the location is the best.[SEP]we had a room that faced the marina and the view was good.[SEP]we asked to have a last minute party for 15 people and they exceeded in every way to make it great.[SEP]the staff couldn, t do enough to help you.[SEP]the place is very clean.
1	my double room was small but the bathroom is worse you have to squeeze you in,25 cm between the opened door and the washbowl![SEP]renovated, yes, but they do not take care, seals in the shower cubicles (in the 2 rooms i booked) are already black and leaking, the bathroom is flooded after showering.[SEP]in some months from now it will be a real mess in the ceilings and walls.[SEP]breakfast ok, friendly staff, good location.[SEP]rooms, street view, are noisy, soccer field in front of the hotel, games going on to 1 am.[SEP]3 bed room was big and nice, but only a very little closet, we have to let our clothes in the suitcase.
1	deserves another.5 stars![SEP]hmc is easily equivalent to a us 3.5 star hotel.[SEP]the property is very nice and i wouldn't entirely agree with the uninteresting rooms description in some other reviews.[SEP]yes, they don't have a lot of character, but they're solid and clean with nice amenities.[SEP]it might get pretty rough in summer, though, as i didn't see an ac unit in ours.[SEP]the location and grounds are nice and the staff was very friendly.[SEP]it's not the type of place i'd go for an extended df stay, but it's quite nice for a night or two if you're entering / leaving df.
1	we stayed this summer at this hotel.[SEP]it was ok.[SEP]the beds were a bit small.[SEP]i don´t even think they were queen size, but instead full size.[SEP]nevertheless, it was on a great location, very close to 5th avenue, rockerfeller center, central park, time square, etc.[SEP]i recommend it if you´re staying a few days in the city.
1	will never stay here again, room was discusting we had to keep opening the window (winter so it was in the minus) just to air out room.[SEP]we continued to ask for the room to be deodorized i think they turned up twice in the week we stayed.[SEP]the pipes sound like someone is breaking into your room.[SEP]the bathroom so smll there is nit even space to put a small toiletry bag.[SEP]location is good bit this is nyc there are multiple hotels on this street for same price and better rooms also have a view that does not consist of a brick wall and a window of a laundry.
1	" theatrical " is probably a good way to describe the interior.[SEP]pros: really interesting and beautiful decor.[SEP]it is on one of the prettiest streets in amsterdam.[SEP]great location for access to the central part of town, but removed enough to be in a quiet neighborhood.[SEP]very friendly and helpful staff.[SEP]the bed and linens were very nice.[SEP]cons: a modern & clean, but poorly designed bathroom.[SEP]no way to shower without getting the whole bathroom wet.[SEP]the natural light in the room was good, but after dark, the room was very dimly lit.[SEP]there was not enough light to read once the sun went down.[SEP]wonderful bed, but the pillows were like rocks.
1	we spent 3 nights at this hotel and chose it because of its central location and good transport links.[SEP]coming in from schoneburg airport is a db train directly to alexanderplatz.[SEP]the hotel itself was ok.[SEP]clean.[SEP]a large hotel too and so breakfast was always busy, queues etc,.[SEP]breakfast itself was good so get a deal if you can to include it.[SEP]staff are efficient but not welcoming or friendly.[SEP]the bathrooms are awful.[SEP]i stayed with a friend and there was no privacy with a partially frosted window glass door separating off the toilet.[SEP]hugely inconvenient because neither of us felt comfortable to use the toilet.[SEP]i won't stay here again if i return to berlin but i would recommend it if you don't mind your travelling partner seeing and hearing you use the toilet.
1	just back from istanbul.[SEP]what a great city it was and also the hotel we stayed was perfect with its location.[SEP]it was located only some steps away from ayasofia and blumosque.[SEP]main points for tourists are easy reachable.[SEP]the hotel staff was so friendly and helpfull.[SEP]good service, reasonable rate, delicious breakfast and free wireless internet collection with this lovely in.[SEP]rooms were clean, equipped with sleepers, bathrobe, a.c and also free tea - coffee bags with kettle.[SEP]higly recommend angels home and definetly will stay again.
1	the location is superb.[SEP]we needed a quiet hotel close to the grand palais for the monet exhibition, in early january.[SEP]la sanguine provided small comfortable rooms.[SEP]they were also cosy and warm.[SEP]stairs are not a problem for us, so the absence of a lift is not an issue.[SEP]the staff were very helpful and their excellent english made up for our just passable french.[SEP]this is a 2 star hotel and a very good 2 star hotel.if you are looking for large rooms and all the decor of the boutique / 4+star hotels then don't expect a small 2 star parisien hotel to fulfil that expectation.[SEP]breakfast, as in most french hotels is overpriced compaired with lunch menus- but that is france.[SEP]having said that, the continental breakfast at la sanguine was good.[SEP]overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our weekend stay here.
1	the last time i went to vegas i stayed at the wynn and mysteriously got upgraded to a tower suite, so i tried to keep things in perspective as i checked in to ti.[SEP]i chose to stay at ti because they had a great rate and i like that end of the strip, having gotten familiar with it during my stay at the wynn.[SEP]ti's location really can't be beat, since it is surrounded by the fashion show mall, wynn / encore, venetian, and mirage.[SEP]for a solo traveler, this means there are plenty of dining and shopping options only a short walk away (the forum shops at caesar's are quite close as well).[SEP]i got a room on the 32nd floor overlooking the pirate cove - i couldn't have asked for anything better.[SEP]the king size bed was super comfortable, and the room furnishing were very classy.[SEP]most importantly, the room and bathroom were clean.[SEP]the bathroom was pretty no - frills, but it was more than adequate and very spacious.[SEP]the only thing that marred my stay was the very slow wifi in the room, but that wasn't a huge deal.[SEP]the restaurants within ti are great for a solo traveler, especially the pizza place and the two starbucks locations.[SEP]i always felt safe in the hotel.[SEP]ti's value and location can't be beat - the next time i go to vegas, ti will be my first choice for lodging.
1	we stayed here for 2 nights at the end of march.[SEP]the hotel staff were extremely helpful and welcoming - the children especially loved the cuddly toys that they were given on arrival.[SEP]the room was fine although noisy the first evening - there seemed to be something wrong with the aircon in the neighbouring room.[SEP]this was remedied however as soon as we pointed it out to the front desk the next morning.[SEP]the hotel is in an excellent location - in back bay which was lovely.[SEP]definitely a good choice in boston.
1	great for family of 5.[SEP]hard to find hotels that will accommodate the 5th.[SEP]hotel brought up a very comfortable cot for my 15 year old son.[SEP]room was large enough to fit cot with plenty of movement space.[SEP]front desk very pleasant and helpful.[SEP]construction was going on working on the outside of the hotel.[SEP]a little noisy in the late morning -- hotel has a nice late check out (noon)--staff was very nice to try and compensate for any inconvenience.[SEP]perfect location, close to everything, safe, historic and classy.
1	stayed as part of a tour this hotel is extremely well placed right in the middle of the shopping area with easy access to eateries for breakfast and dinner.[SEP]it is an old hotel which is very clean and nicely decorated in an old but pleasant style.[SEP]the rooms were the smallest on the tour but were perfectly adequate although one or two people changed their room due to a noisy location(at the front of the hotel) or because they had been smoking rooms, a nice touch was the provision of some essential items although the ladies razor was of little use to me.[SEP]it has access to a restaurant but i do not think it belongs to the hotel - breakfast there was fine and a reasonable price but we preferred the betty boop diner across the road.[SEP]the jazz restuarant around the corner was great for dinner and the music - moderate price.[SEP]the best thing about this hotel apart from the very reasonable price is its location.[SEP]ideal for the trolley cars which terminates just around the corner and the f route trolly bus which takes you down to fishermans wharf.[SEP]we walked through chinatown down to the crooked lombard street then walked back to the hotel after the trolley bus unexpected stopped at the markets on the pier(due to a march in market street)
1	we flew into chicago for a weekend getaway.[SEP]the talbott was lovely.[SEP]great location.[SEP]beautiful lobby.[SEP]friendly staff![SEP]everyone from the doorman to the front desk staff was friendly and helpful.[SEP]we will definitely return.
1	we stayed 6 nights at ti.[SEP]we stayed after a recommendation from my sister.[SEP]pro's: -great location - nice clean room - good size room with great view of strip and pool con's: -housekeeping was very loud and banging on our door at 8:00am on sunday morning.[SEP]-very expensive drinks at the pool.[SEP]beer $7.00, small mixed drink $9.00.[SEP]-booked and pre - paid for non - smoking room - checked in and were given smoking room.[SEP]we would not settle on a smoking and they found us a non - smoking within minutes.[SEP]- very smoky and dark casino.[SEP](we went through many and this was with the worst) -pool chairs are touching one another.[SEP]awkward!![SEP]-hard to get a chair at the pool after 9:00am (weekend or weekday) - no in room fridge.[SEP](downer when drinks are $7 + each!!) - tv remote didn't work and only got a few channels - bad sewage smell around the pool drains.[SEP]the cons were not so bad that we wouldn't stay here again, however there are many hotels to choose from so i think we would try something else next time.
1	clean hotel in a very good location.[SEP]street noise is somewhat of a problem, but i think most hotels in the city have that problem.[SEP]the rooms were on the small side but had what you needed (fridge, coffee pot, tv and safe) and ours had a king bed.[SEP]hotel staff was nice and polite.[SEP]the parking garage attendent wasn't very polite when we entered the garage, when i asked to retrieve eye glasses later in the day and when we left.[SEP]his actions cost him about $20 in tips.
1	you can bring the kids here and know that there will be plenty of things to do, and lots of stuff to explorer.[SEP]the pool is very cool, and the place was recently renovated, so everything is fresh and bright.[SEP]you have to try their straw - lada non - alcoholic drink.[SEP]it is to die for![SEP]the beach is nice and the location is perfect.
1	this hotel was exactly as it looks on the website.[SEP]i have never stayed anywhere that this was true.[SEP]sometimes i am dissappointed but not this time.[SEP]the donatello was even better than we expected.[SEP]great location.[SEP]it is near the shops in union square and near the cable car.[SEP]lots of restaurants close by.[SEP]the staff was wonderful and very helpful in getting us transportaion and directions to wherever we wanted to go the room was very spacious and the bed was really comfortable.[SEP]we had a microwave, refrigerator and coffee.[SEP]can't think of anything negative about it.[SEP]it was the very best and the rates were great.[SEP]i would definetly stay there again.....
1	have stayed several times here and never disappointed.[SEP]perfect location for all that the west side of manhattan has to offer, from lincoln and time warner centers to central park and the columbus circle heart of nyc transit system.[SEP]clean room with upscale amenities.[SEP]very quiet which was surprising given that we were on a low floor facing broadway.[SEP]excellent window covers (perfect for late - rising guests!).[SEP]attentive staff.[SEP]we will return!
1	good location, easy to access different transportation e.g. a41 airport bus, free shuttle bus service from hotel to shatin railway station.[SEP]10 minutes walk to sun tin wai railway station.[SEP]surrounded by plenty local chinese food shop.[SEP]cyber feel newly design room with plenty mirrors and semi - see through glass enclosed toilet inside.[SEP]romantic for couple but inconvenience for visitor or tourmate
1	lovely hotel, excellent service we recently returned from four days at the the michelangelo and were very pleased with this charming european - flavor hotel, its staff, and the location.[SEP]we are very particular and experienced travelers who make every effort to select top - class hotels that not only offer quality accomodations, but provide a unique experience - we were not disappointed with the michelangelo.[SEP]i contacted the hotel directly prior to our arrival explaining the circumstances of our trip, and they were very kind and receptive to helping to make our stay a special experience - louis and james are excellent representatives for this hotel.[SEP]when we arrived we were upgraded to a larger room and a thoughtful box of godiva chocolates was left for us our first night.[SEP]the overall ambiance of the hotel was warm and inviting elegance and the service exceptional.[SEP]we were traveling with some friends who had lost their luggage and the staff at the hotel were very instrumental in helping them locate their bags - they even stayed on the phone for more than 45 minutes to get through for information on the lost luggage.[SEP]we would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to new york.....[SEP]unless you are like one of the previous reviewers who prefers hotels with vending machines.[SEP]if so, this is not the hotel for you.[SEP]our congratulations and appreciation to the michelangelo and its staff for the great job you are doing.... definitely a class act.
1	the four seasons sultanahmet exceeded all expectations.[SEP]perfect location, beautiful rooms and bathrooms, gracious staff.[SEP]we were a party of five celebrating a 50th birthday.[SEP]the main celebratory night was held on the roof and was truly a night to remember.[SEP]our only minor complaint was that the rest of the guests seemed to retire very early, so when we decided to pay a late night trip to the bar (11.45pm) we found it deserted (of guests and staff).
1	we stay at the hyatt on saturday january 14th for 1 night.[SEP]the rate was $125 plus $21 taxes.[SEP]the check in went smooth.[SEP]the room was on the 9th floor in the west building.[SEP]the building is older and the rooms seem a bit old.[SEP]the hallways are in need of updating for sure.[SEP]the rooms are poorly sound proofed.[SEP]i could hear the cell phone ring, heater and toilet in the room next to us.[SEP]the room itself was small but comfortable.[SEP]the parking fee of $50 + per day is outrageous.[SEP]the cost for 3 at their' bistro' breakfast was $70+.....[SEP]not worth it.[SEP]location is very good, right on the chicago river.[SEP]but the costs of the food / parking would make this a hotel we would not stay at for more then 1 day.
1	we booked the hotel through hotwire and received an excellent room rate.[SEP]unfortunately, the hotel was not a four - star in our book.[SEP]we should have realized that there might be a problem with the room when we saw a set of complimentary earplugs on the sink.[SEP]maybe it was just this room, but the wall was paper thin on the left side of the room and we heard continual noise from our neighbors.[SEP]also, the street noise on saturday at night was annoying even though we were on the fourteenth floor.[SEP]other than that, the location of the hotel is excellent for exploring downtown s.f. the room was clean, the service was good, the view was beautiful, and an inexpensive continental breakfast was available in the lobby.[SEP]parking was expensive so we parked one block away for half of the price.
1	stayed here from 8th april for 3 nights and had a very enjoyable stay.[SEP]staff were very friendly and helpful.[SEP]the ooms were nice if a tad smaller than we are used to and the absence of a bath was a disappointment having said that the were nicely decorated with modern furnishings and a flat screen tv.[SEP]the hotel is in a quiet location about 15 minutes walk to the placa catalunya or 2 minutes to the rocaforte metro stop (and then 5 minutes on the l3 line to the pl.[SEP]catalunya) we did find the breakfast room a bit of a crush but the food was adequate and frequently replenished.
1	large suites with every amenity.[SEP]service was outstanding, the bed was extremely comfortable and they thought of all the little things that make a difference.[SEP]lighted makeup mirror, 3 tvs including in the bathroom, great working desk area, etc.[SEP]location on the strip is perfect.[SEP]so many choices there for dining and the spa is fantastic.
1	good hotel, good location.[SEP]tough to find street parking but possible.[SEP]don't park right across from hotel where homeless village set up.[SEP]hotel charges $29 for parking.[SEP]big rip off!
1	we got trapped by the east cost blizzard and needed to hunker down for 2 days in san francisco.[SEP]we have stayed at the orchard hotel several times before but they were sold out.[SEP]we were lucky enough to get a junior suite at this sister property and we were delighted with the hotel.[SEP]the location is great - literally at the gates of wonderful and must see chinatown.[SEP]our room was comfy and the bed was terrific.[SEP]big bathroom with free standing glass shower and tub.[SEP]the staff were lovely and you are surrounded by great restaurants and wonderful shopping on union square.[SEP]not only did they take us in, but they were gracious enough to allow an early check in as our flight was cancelled at 9 a.m. it was a rainy and cold day and we were so happy to check in and re - think our holiday plans.[SEP]hats off to this wonderful hotel and it's kind and generous staff.[SEP]we will be back.
1	we spent 2 weeks at this hotel in september 2007 and think the comfort suites are excellent.[SEP]we have been to florida on 4 occasions, staying in hotels, motels and an executive villa and this accommodation was by far the best experience we have ever had.[SEP]the rooms are very spacious, comfortable and exceptionally clean as are all areas of the hotel.[SEP]the full size fridge, coffee maker, microwave and hairdryer were all in excellent working order (which is commonly not the case in other hotels).[SEP]the pool and jacuzzi provide a relaxing environment between theme parks and the 2 for 1 frozen cocktails and meals served at the poolside bar are delicious.[SEP]the hotel is in a great location for old town and a good selection of restaurants are within walking distance.[SEP]the hot & cold buffet breakfast is a great start to the day and the availability of coffee 24 hours is very handy.[SEP]this hotel is an excellent choice and is so much more than a base from which to do the theme parks.[SEP]i would go back tomorrow - if only to steal the extremely comfortable mattress from the huge bed!
1	i treated my 2 daughters and myself to a holiday in new york staying at the roosevelt hotel.[SEP]we had read the reviews so knew the bedrooms were small - and they were!![SEP]having said that, they were spotlessly clean with new bed linen and towels every day.[SEP]the shower was one of the best i have ever used![SEP]the location is very good.[SEP]we found the consierge very helpful with any queries we had.[SEP]we had a day out at woodbury common (out of town designer shopping outlet).[SEP]it is an hour out of new york on grayline buses from the port authority bus station and costs â£20 ($40).[SEP]it was very good but exhausting.
1	i stayed at the marriott eastside on a business trip.[SEP]i was very pleasantly suprised.[SEP]here's the lowdown: 1.[SEP]room nicely refurbished and fresh with down comforter, large screen tv, attractive furnishings, clean bathroom.[SEP]2.[SEP]the gym![SEP]it's on the 32nd floor, overlooking manhattan.[SEP]new machines with video screens attached and earplugs.[SEP]small but quite wonderful.[SEP]3.[SEP]the modern concierge lounge with large screen televsions was a big plus.[SEP]check into it.[SEP]a buffet breakfast with eggs, bagels, muffins, fresh fruit, salmon, etc.[SEP]free non - alcoholic drinks and at night an honor bar.[SEP]food was set out in the evening, and although its meant for appetizers, some seemed to making a small dinner of it.[SEP]4.[SEP]i ate lunch in the grille.[SEP]perfectly good food, excellent service.[SEP]with so many excellent restaurants in nyc it wouldn't be my first choice, but on for a business trip luncheon, it suited me fine.[SEP]5.[SEP]the location is great, and i had only small pangs seeing the w hotel and the waldorf astoria slightly down the street.[SEP]in summary, it's a great value, with the location, fab little gym, concierge lounge and freshly renovated rooms.
1	my wife and i have stayed at vagabond inn two times, in january 2010 and october this year.[SEP]we have met a very service minded front desk clerck, ida, with the most winning smile.[SEP]in october we stayed there for 6 days.[SEP]the location was excellent for exploring san diego.[SEP]the room was very clean and quiet (we stayed away from the i-8).[SEP]the waffel breakfast was very good (they did an experiment with a pancake machine the last day, but the waffels are much better).[SEP]we would like to come back.[SEP]upc, oslo, norway
1	excellent location, with a metro station right out the front door, 10 min walk from the ramblas and the harbour area.[SEP]the rooms are spacious, which is a rarity in europe![SEP]and the staff are incredibly helpful.[SEP]they actually go out of their way to caution you about the pickpockets in barca and help you out with recommendations and bookings and ticket printouts.[SEP]really enjoyed my stay there and would surely come back.
1	hotel was wonderful.[SEP]small room, but had everything we needed.[SEP]location was very good.[SEP]service was ok.[SEP]expect rude french service in the dining area.
1	stayed overnight here with husband and son.[SEP]it's a great location in terms of being near shopping and bars and restaurants.[SEP]the rooms were okay but the walls are very thin.[SEP]you can hear everything.[SEP]it's nothing special and there are much better hotels very nearby, including homewood suites and embassy suites.
1	for my first visit to the eventi, i just completed a 10 day stay in a' cityview' room.[SEP]the room was well sized for ny and the bathroom was very well appointed with a wonderful shower.[SEP]i picked the hotel based on price and location and wasn't disappointed as it is very well situated for penn station & the flatiron & chelsea districts the hotel overall was stylish, especially the bar & restaurant area, and in great condition with friendly, welcoming staff.[SEP]it's also very good to get free wifi service on joining the kimpton intouch programme.[SEP]two areas disappointed me somewhat.[SEP]i was staggered at the cost of a laundry bill - it would have been almost as cheap to have bought new clothes.[SEP]additionally service in the restaurant was often very slow both at breakfast & dinner.[SEP]these quibbles, notwithstanding, the eventi delivered a very good guest experience and made an extended business trip to ny both comfortable and pleasant.[SEP]i recommend the hotel.
1	we had a great stay at the hotel torino.[SEP]we stayed in the annex building, which was nice because we got the entire floor to ourselves.[SEP]the staff were friendly and helpful and the location was awesome![SEP]it was near st.[SEP]mark's square and very easy to navigate to and from.[SEP]the only complaint is our air conditioner was broken and we opened the windows and mosquitoes got in our room.[SEP]so we got bit but other than that it was fabulous!!!!
1	we stayed at this hotel for five nights and we loved it![SEP]after santa monica fairmont hotel we were amazed just how far your money can go in vegas.[SEP]we booked one of the suites and the view from the 35th floor was awesome![SEP]the suite was clean and tidy and had two and a half bathrooms.[SEP]a bit much for the two of us and i felt for the cleaning ladies.[SEP]we ordered room service one night and even though it took about an hour, we were advised of the wait, it was well worth it.[SEP]the meals were massive but very tasty.[SEP]the location was excellent as bellagio is located in the middle of the strip.[SEP]the buffet dinner was also very nice as it had something for everyone.[SEP]the shopping in vegas is amazing but make sure you go to the outlet malls as the prices on the strip are good but nothing compared to the outlets.[SEP]all in all vegas has something for everyone and we will try to go back.[SEP]your money will get you better accommodation and service than you could get in resorts in asia, another popular aussie destination.[SEP]just don't blow your cash on the slots.[SEP]save it for the shopping!:)
1	pros * brilliant location, literally 300 m from the colosseum with a slight view from rooms.[SEP]the hotel also has a roof terrace (although not open in winter) which offers views.[SEP]* included breakfast was nice - though probably a little expensive at 15 euro if you have to pay for it.[SEP]* staff for the most part were friendly / helpful and all spoke and understood basic english.[SEP]* good size rooms & bathroom.[SEP]* air - conditioning works well.[SEP]cons * room had an occasional sewerage like smell.[SEP]the hotel staff attempted to mask it with a deodoriser.[SEP]was nt too overpowering and did nt really affect us as we did nt spend a lot of time in the hotel.[SEP]* pillows were quite hard / uncomfortable.[SEP]* unusual pillar in the middle of the room directly in front of the tv which was slightly annoying but again, not unliveable.[SEP]* some fresh fruit would have been nice for breakfast.
1	we stayed at the hotel between dec.[SEP]17th and dec.[SEP]20th.[SEP]payed about 165 a night via a priceline auction (including taxes and fees).[SEP]the good: - they let us check in early - good front desk service - room was clean - no bed bugs (there were reports that there have been - i checked everything very carefully when we arrived) - decent location close to subway, 5th ave., park, times square - i liked the shower pressure the not so good: - drafty window in the bathrooms which has been mentioned multiple times - room has been updated, but not 100% updated - noisy at night via the streets below and hallways
1	the hotel is ok.[SEP]the lobby is dimly lit and not very welcoming.[SEP]the lifts are old and take some time to arrive.[SEP]the room was again dimly lit but comfortable and clean.[SEP]the location is the best aspect of the hotel.[SEP]its not worth the 200 + pounds a night, but again its harder to get a cheaper hotel in manhatten, in that location.[SEP]the free breakfast is nothing to rave about - pieces of melon and some cakes and bad coffee.[SEP]its old and tired and needs some money spent but i guess that won't happen whilst they continue to charge high prices for a very average room.[SEP]just do nt expect very much from this hotel but its in a good location so that s the only plus point.
1	the staff is outstanding!![SEP]we were happy with every aspect of our stay.[SEP]only thing is to be careful to where your rooms is.[SEP]if you are in the molokai wing, i would recommend changing rooms.[SEP]we were original assigned there, and were ok with it, then a friend upgraded our room to the lanai wing and it was 200% better.[SEP]the views and location is more than we could ask for.[SEP]you are a short walk from the black rock and the whalers village.[SEP]also the tiki terrace restaurant is very yummy.[SEP]our wedding was very beautiful!!
1	the initial shock when you walk into the lobby will wear of quickly as you get settled in.[SEP]the hotel really is something else than all your normal hotels.[SEP]if you digg the arts even a bit you'll love this hotel.[SEP]it's at an great location, right outside the chinatown gate and only a couple of minutes walk from union square and the great shopping opportunities.[SEP]it's a walking distance from almost everywhere even walking to fisherman's wharf isn't that bad when you walk through chinatown and little italy to get there.[SEP]the rooms are quite small but still nice.[SEP]flatscreen tv: s and ipod docks are nice to have.[SEP]the minibar is unfortunately locked with a key, but they key is available at the front desk and it was offered to us at initial check - in.[SEP]the rooms we're basically very clean and only the bathroom had a couple of points that could have been a bit cleaner.[SEP]unfortunately we didn't have any kind of view from our room, but that didn't matter to us.[SEP]a nice little touch are the really original " do not disturb "- signs.[SEP]choose triton and your going to have a great time with a reasonable price in sf!
1	this hotel is in a really good location for seeing things in boston.[SEP]we received a warm welcome.[SEP]the room wasn't great - a function of being in an old hotel.[SEP]the bed was really comfortable.[SEP]there's always a manager on duty in the lobby checking things are ok.[SEP]one serious negative point - the bar had run out of sam adams![SEP]in boston!
1	best deal in nyc great hotel for the money.[SEP]we stayed on the 17th floor of the belvedere in a good size room and a nice view.[SEP]the room had a kitchenette and a king size bed.[SEP]the staff was wonderful and the location was great.[SEP]located in a residential neighborhood within walking distance to all.[SEP]several restaurants and grocery stores nearby.[SEP]you also have a refrigerator and a microwave in the room at no additional charge.[SEP]i would stay here again.[SEP]you ca nt beat the price and the location of this hotel.[SEP]subway, theaters, times square and shopping all nearby.[SEP]the hotel had new furniture and was extremely clean.[SEP]i loved everything about this hotel.
1	stayed here with one of my good friends and payed an extra $40 p / n for an upgrade tower twin room.[SEP]view wasn't the best..[SEP]but it was a very modern design, and definitely felt clean.[SEP]the bed is the best, one of the most comfyiest beds i have slept in..[SEP]almost want to steal it and take it home with me![SEP]staff were lovely, always had a smile, even the housekeepers![SEP]location was only a minute or two walk from pitt street mall and 5 - 10 minutes from the harbour!
1	we are not budget travellers, we enjoy staying in 5 star resorts & had just returned from the hilton waikoloa village in kona hawaii.[SEP]however we do subscribe to the theory that when visiting a city as tourists we would rather spend our money on something other than an expensive hotel room which is ultimately just a place to rest our heads etc.[SEP]so we look for an economy, comfortable, clean room, with private bathroom in a central location.[SEP]the celebrity hotel met & exceeded our expectations![SEP]the staff are very friendly & helpful![SEP]the location is absolutely brilliant, so central to everything & a great area to walk around in & shop & dine till late in the evening.[SEP]the room is large but very basic & decor very dated.[SEP]we did notice they are busy with a renovation while we were staying, however this did not inconvenience us at all![SEP]bathrooms clean & adequate.[SEP]we dis- agree with a previous post, the breakfast was great, a muffin or croissant with cream cheese, coffee or juice - more than enough to start the day & a really nice touch especially that it was free.[SEP]the internet free as well.....[SEP]another value add in a town where things can be really expensive.[SEP]we would highly recommend this hotel & would definetly stay here again![SEP]it is also worth mentioning that we booked this hotel directly as a result of the positive feedback on this site & once again tripadvisor has served us well.... thank you trip advisor for a great site!!
1	there simply isn't anything negative to report.[SEP]the room was spotless.[SEP]the room was quiet.[SEP]the room was reasonably priced.[SEP]the breakfast was excellent.[SEP]parking was plentiful and free.[SEP]i left a $5 tip for the housekeeping staff.[SEP]the location, in a business park dominated by qualcomm buildings (qualcomm is a major high - technology company), is not near any major san diego attractions, but that's ok.[SEP]unless it's rush hour, you can be in downtown san diego, sea world, la jolla, or del mar in about 20 minutes.[SEP]you will, however, need a car ; i wouldn't try to get there by public transportation.
1	ask for room 4812.[SEP]it's a corner room, overlooking times square.[SEP]the room was spacious and the bathroom was roomy.[SEP]unlike the w on lexington, i prefer this location.[SEP]concierge michael was extremely efficient and gets and a+.[SEP]the hotel is walking distance to all broadway theaters and some pretty good restaurants.[SEP]blue fin in the hotel is also superb.
1	this hotel offered everything we wanted ; clean and spacious rooms, very helpful staff and perfect central location in san diego.[SEP]it's also very close to a lot of great restaurants and fashion valley mall.[SEP]the hotel is also very close to the light rail station to take the train to old town or downtown.[SEP]we stayed here two nights in january and the always felt welcome.[SEP]as a hhonors member, this hotel provided excellent delivery of the hhonors benefits, including breakfast for all in the room, internet, water and of course fabulous cookies.[SEP]would certainly stay here again as it meets the hilton standard for hotel quality.
1	hotel is in a fantastic location.[SEP]the deco is a bit run down, but overall not disappointing if you are not expecting too much.[SEP]staff at reception a bit frosty, but professional... breakfast simple with not many options.[SEP]but that s normal in many french hotels.[SEP]the only disappointment is room service.[SEP]the hotels advertises room service when actually they order from a different place from outside... so if you need a cup of tea or coffee late in the evening... forget it!
1	we were in vancouver for a couple of days to do some shopping and i had a business meeting to attend.[SEP]the fairmont waterfront was our choice because of location in the downtown sector.[SEP]from the greeting at the front door to our leaving we were impressed by the quality of service, cleanliness of the hotel, atmosphere and professionalism of the staff.[SEP]what impressed us the most was the herons restaurant staff.[SEP]i have a onion allergy.[SEP]when i mentioned this to our server she said she would tell the kitchen.[SEP]this happens quite often when mentioning my allergy.[SEP]what does not happen is when the server came back she brought the chef to talk to me.[SEP]after a short discussion he said he could adjust my entree choice with no problem.[SEP]he also went through the trouble of creating a salad for my appetizer choice that was no longer on the menu.[SEP]i have eaten at a lot of high end restaurants (and not so high end) where they have been very accomodating for my allergy but this was the first time the chef actually came out to talk to me about it.[SEP]kodos to the server and the chef for going that one step further.[SEP]i can't say enough about how impressed my wife and i were for the level of service we received during our stay at the waterfront.[SEP]all round service, quality of food, great atmosphere, fantastic view from our room will bring us back again to the waterfront.
1	this hotel gives you surprising value for money for a parisian hotel.[SEP]the rooms are small and the stairs are quite " adventurous ", but everything is clean and comfortable.[SEP]the location is great - we walked from the hotel to the champs elysee, the louvre and to sacre coeur.[SEP]furthermore there are 3 different metro stops in the immediate vicinity.[SEP]we had the breakfast on 2 days and i felt like it was pretty good.[SEP]not overly exciting, but for 8 euros a fair offer.[SEP]overall i would really recommend this hotel for your stay in paris!
1	yes, we payed $300 a night but we knew that going in and the hotel exceeded our expectations.[SEP]we arrived early, around 11 am, and went into the inn to store our luggage.[SEP]we were told our room was ready so we were able to check in right then, wonderful news![SEP]the room and bathroom were large and the bed was extremely comfortable.[SEP]everything was tastefully appointed.[SEP]service was always immediate and professional.[SEP]this was our first trip to seattle and the location was outstanding![SEP]pike place market was fabulous ; a perfect blend of tourists and locals.[SEP]we used the fifth floor deck every day.[SEP]we really, really enjoyed our stay at inn at the market and would stay again.
1	the hotel is under going a gradual refurbishment and many of the rooms are in a desperate state with dampness and 1970's decor and fittings.[SEP]it took 3 attempts to find a room that matched what we booked, each time the reception staff had no idea what sort of room they were sending me to and didn't really care i was unhappy.[SEP]we avoided doing anything other sleeping & showering in the hotel as the prices were very expensive and the dining room looked awful.[SEP]however the location is excellent and everything is reached by walking if you have the time and energy.[SEP]we walked from battery park back up to mid - manhattan, it took about 90 minutes but its a great way to see the city.
1	i stayed here for the first' tme' in march 2008.[SEP]it's an excellent hotel that really makes an effort on the details.[SEP]i was in a king room which was reasonably sized, had excellent lighting, nice decor.[SEP]housekeepers were extremely nice and good, all the staff i encountered were good in fact.[SEP]location on 49th st/8th ave.[SEP]is terrific... near times sq.[SEP]and theaters, one block from a subway, half a block from an excellent supermarket if you want to buy your own breakfast.[SEP]i've already made a reservation for my next trip to nyc.
1	i stayed here for five nights in a room on the third floor of the " amsterdam wing ", or a separate building with a separate entrance that opens out right into the red light district.[SEP]my traveling companions were severely bitten by bed bugs, and since arriving home we have had to incur tremendous expense cleaning or throwing away every item we brought with us on the trip.[SEP]we have complained to the hotel and heard nothing back in response.[SEP]that we have not heard back is not surprising because when we were there the level of service was so horrendous as to be shocking.[SEP]when a " concierge " was even at the concierge desk (not often) they were completely unhelpful and rude.[SEP]multiple " concierges " were unable to recommend a single restaurant other than the eateries in the hotel, and one reported back that he " doesn't go to restaurants " so he had no available information on any in the area.[SEP]i've seen other reviewers complain about the noise level - this was not an issue for us.[SEP]the location was terrific, but (bed bugs aside) the hotel is not worth the high prices they charge, and on top of the high charges they tried to nickel and dime us on every occasion, including trying to charge us twice an extra person charge we prepaid and the astronomically high 6 euro per hour charge for wireless internet.
1	we decided to stay here based on other reviews on ta and we're so glad we did.[SEP]we booked via the hotel website which offered a good deal.[SEP]this hotel was brilliant![SEP]upon arrival the receptionist was very friendly and helpful.[SEP]the lift was little so we did have to make a couple of trips with our two huge suitcases however, it was a very short ride.[SEP]our room was small which is expected in central paris.[SEP]the decor was very chic / parisian and cosy.[SEP]the bathroom was new and stylish.[SEP]minutes away from luxembourg gardens, st germain blvd and a short walk to the louvre and other attractions.[SEP]location allowed us to walk everywhere with the stroller which was convenient and enjoyable as there was always something to see, do, eat or buy.[SEP]st germain is amazing![SEP]we would definitely return to this hotel on future visits to paris.
1	when we arrived we were booked into a classic room - this was on the ground floor next to the reception and wasn't really what we were expecting.[SEP]we upgraded (at a charge) to a junior suite, which was much more like it.[SEP]four poster bed, tall ceilings, intricate artwork and great views out onto campo santa maria formosa.[SEP]the location is very convenient, with just a 5 minute walk to either rialto or san marco.[SEP]it was very easy to get to, and i'd almost advise getting off at ft.[SEP]nove if you're catching the alilaguna line from the airport, as the waterbus is quite slow and it takes 10 minutes to walk from there at most (minding out if you have lots of luggage however), rather than the 20 or so minutes it will take to get around to san marco.[SEP]the staff were very friendly, both front of house and in the bar / breakfast.[SEP]breakfast was good, the pastries were cooked fresh i believe and were delicious.[SEP]all in all, a very good stay.[SEP]my biggest advice would be to stay in one of the suites as that's when this hotel really does come into its own.
1	stayed here for 4 nights while in vancouver, the hotel is centrally located close to all downtown areas in a landmark location.[SEP]i have to say i was a little disappointed overall though i m finding it hard to justify to myself why this is the case, perhaps i had excessive expectations given the reputation of the fairmont.[SEP]the reception and lobby areas are well maintained and portray the grandeur of the hotel.[SEP]the rooms were a slightly dated but were clean and comfortable and maintained in the overall style of the hotel.[SEP]the staff were friendly and professional, though i found their demeanor very business like as opposed to some hotels where you can feel genuine friendliness in the staff.[SEP]the only real complaint i have is that there was filming going on in the lounge on our second evening and we normally returned for a drink before bed.[SEP]the manager in charge was pleasant but pushy and wasn't keen on letting us in until the director came over and said it was okay that they weren't ready yet.[SEP]the whole issue could have been avoided if we were informed on check in that the filming would be going on and the bar closed on that night and we could have made alternative arrangements.[SEP]overall it's a decent hotel and if you are getting a good deal on the room then it's worth a stay.
1	we had a wonderful experience at the hotel oceania.[SEP]the location is excellent with public transportation, great restaurants and shopping very nearby.[SEP]the rooms were quiet and clean.[SEP]the staff was very gracious and helpful and the serve really delicious coffee![SEP]rick steves (2012) certainly didn't disappoint.
1	we arrived early at the hotel but we were informed that they can keep our luggage safely until the required check in time.[SEP]staffs incl.[SEP]the housekeepers were very courteous and friendly (always had smile on their faces, makes us feel very welcome).[SEP]room for couple is just enough since we only need it for sleeping.[SEP]all day till midnight we were out exploring the city.[SEP]very good location, accessible to nearby stores and walking distance to most tourist spots, 10 - 45 mins walk.[SEP]breakfast was the best we ever had and good choices even for weight watcher.[SEP]will definitely choose this hotel next time we go back to paris.[SEP]we've been recommending this hotel to our friends for cost and accessibilitity
1	my husband and i stayed at hotel valadier for 2 nites.[SEP]the hotel is in a great location, very close to flaminio station, walking distance to the spanish steps and we even walked all the way to the colosseum.[SEP]the hotel rooms are small but this is europe and you can not expect us sized rooms.[SEP]it was plenty big for the two of us.[SEP]it's a charming hotel, in a safe neighborhood, hotel staff was good and the buffet breakfast included in the hotel rate was good.[SEP]great coffee too![SEP]i took the train from the rome airport and then took the metro to flaminio station, total cost was 12 euros and took about an hour.[SEP]my husband took a taxi and it cost 60 euros.[SEP]you have to pay for internet service which was a drag but at least it was available.
1	great location.[SEP]sumptuous beds, linens and towels.[SEP]awesome bath products.[SEP]indoor pool.[SEP]great gym.[SEP]lively bar.[SEP]spacious rooms.[SEP]what would i change?[SEP]the spa / hot tub / steam / sauna closes a bit early (i wish it was open until 11 pm instead of 8 pm or 9 pm).[SEP]tv's don't have sleep timers (i called and asked), missing in - room coffee makers, the room controls are a bit complex.[SEP]the location and other amenities still make it my sf favorite.
1	i too purchased a living social coupon for the allerton.[SEP]i had stayed there before, a number of years ago.[SEP]we did not have to wait for check in, but a paper copy of the coupon was required, necessitating a trip to the business center and a wait for others to finish using the two computers available.[SEP]if restaurants can use the number from my phone, why can't the allerton?[SEP]or at least specify this in advance.[SEP]but our suite was lovely, we got two drinks in the lounge, and the location is unsurpassed., the two young ladies who accompanied us, my granddaughter and a friend, slept on the pull out sofa and complained bitterly about the discomfort.[SEP]the king bed in the bedroom was quite comfortable.[SEP]wonderful views of michigan avenue.[SEP]the staff was very helpful upon check - out, checking our bags and later retrieving them and loading them into our taxi.[SEP]i would recommend it and will be staying again.
1	the courtyard met my needs as a business traveler.[SEP]the room had many nice features ; i especially like the room amenities for getting my work done.[SEP]good wireless internet service (free), great desk space and comfortable chair - just what i need for my travels.[SEP]the hotel pool and jacuzzi pool were comfortable and well taken care of.[SEP]the lounge / bar area was comfortable with a bartender who was very personable and gracious.[SEP]also a very interesting location adjacent to the former naval training center that has been turned over to private enterprise.[SEP]lots of areas to take long walks and enjoy the marina / harbor area.[SEP]really liked having both a trader joe's and vons, and cold stone creamery within walking distance.[SEP]only complaint was that the parking lot got a bit noisy on a couple of nights.[SEP]i prefer to sleep with an open window and it seemed that management could have asked groups of partying people in the parking lot to keep the noise down after 10 pm but they didn't.
1	not one complaint![SEP]my husband, myself and 2 adult children spent 5 nights at the ohana east and the experience could not have been better![SEP]i scoured the internet for weeks looking at travel offers, reading reviews, etc.[SEP]and decided what i could afford was the ohana east even though some of the reviews weren't that great.[SEP]i don't know what some people are expecting but we were very pleased with the ohana.[SEP]i booked through the online ohana family website - great people - for a lower price than any of the trip planning companies (like expedia, orbitz).[SEP]i told them i was a light sleeper and they made sure i had a room on the 15th floor and away from the elevator.[SEP]our rooms had great views, one with a limited ocean view and one with a mountain view (realy nice at night).[SEP]we had a room with a kitchenette(microwave, sink, dishes, frig) which made our bathroom a bit small but not that small.[SEP]some reviews of the ohana east complain about the small bathrooms but they are average - please, if you think you need a huge luxury spa bath suite than have sense enough to book and pay for a luxury hotel![SEP]we were there over 4th of july and never had any problems whatsoever with anything- elevators were fast, everything was clean and in good working order, employees were great, location was awsome.[SEP]we all would stay there again and will recommed it to friends and family.
1	highly recommend this place.[SEP]ca nt fault it in any way.[SEP]huge room packed with facilities and a large bed and wonderful bathroom.[SEP]my only complaint was the weak strength of the wi fi signal in my room which was too weak to be used.[SEP]otherwise i can not fault the hotel and the location is excellent
1	i stayed here for two nights in october for a weekend with 3 girlfriends.[SEP]the hotel was really good for our needs.[SEP]breakfast was included in the price & i'm sure if we got up earlier we'd have benefited from the smoked salmon that had been on offer.[SEP]the staff in the restaurant were young & busy.[SEP]the concierge was superbly professional & helpful with taxi to airport at a good price 40euros.[SEP]it was a good location for us to get to bars & restaurants.[SEP]best thing about the room was the bed, wow it was amazing best hotel bed ever!!
1	we stayed here as part of a package deal.[SEP]the location was perfect - close to everything on lido island and a supermarket directly next door (despite us walking round in circles trying to find one) a 10 min or so walk to the other side of the island where the beach is, but we preferred being on the waterfront side.[SEP]the vapperettos were easy to use and navigate and the cost of the tickets wasn't much.[SEP]we enjoyed not being in the thick of the tourist traps of the main island.[SEP]the room in the hotel was very small, but clean.[SEP]the decor was a bit dated but we were only there a few days and out and about all day anyway- so were not fussed by this.[SEP]a redeeming factor was that there was a fridge which we found useful for storing our gorgeous deli meats and cheeses.[SEP]the breakfast was also a good spread of hot food as well as continental style toast /cereals and fruits.[SEP]over all - for what we paid and the location it was a good place to stay.[SEP]the only downside was the size of the room.[SEP]the service at the hotel was great, they helped us with overweight luggage issues (curse you ryanair:)) and were just generally very accommodating.
1	i read reviews on trip advisor and they were mixed, but as it was a very convenient location and they offered us an apartment which accommodated our two kids and my husand and i we took a gamble.[SEP]but what a surprise....![SEP]it was fantastic.[SEP]the location was the absolute best we could have found and our apartment was amazing.[SEP]very very modern with plasma screens in each bedroom and dvd players, lovely decor, jacuzzzi bath (which the kids loved) two bathrooms a small kitchen and living room with a pull out bed, where our ten year old slept, so it meant we all had our own rooms to sleep in.[SEP]the staff were so helpful and made dinner recommendations and reservations for us each night which were just brilliant, delicious food, not too far away and well priced home cooked cuisine.[SEP]breakfast every morning was brought to the room and the trolley filled with warm, filing pastries, eggs, cheese and rolls, just perfect.[SEP]rome was beauitful but hotel mozart made it even more pleasurable, convenient and a great place to relax at the end of very hectic days walking.[SEP]i highly recommend it......!
1	hidden gem antica dimora was the perfect retreat after a busy day of sight - seeing and the hustle and bustle of the streets of florence.[SEP]we had a wonderful two nights here and wished we could have stayed for longer.[SEP]the rooms are beautifully decorated in a traditional italian style with an abundance of colour and attention to detail.[SEP]our room had a beautiful four poster bed (which i believe they all have) and a small balcony.[SEP]my only complaint was that it was a little noisy in the morning but this was because we had the room closest to the breakfast room.[SEP]this was not a problem though.[SEP]the breakfast was good with a variety of cakes, meats, cheeses and breads etc.[SEP]to choose from.[SEP]it's in a good location, a little out of town, around a ten / fifteen minute walk to il duomo which we always enjoyed.[SEP]especially enjoyed after a long lazy evening of tasting the florentine food and wine.[SEP]i really fell in love with antica dimora, it's so beautifully decorated and really does feel like your home when you are staying there.[SEP]we shall definitely be returning and would recommend it to all who are considering staying there.
1	we stayed there in late january 2012.[SEP]the reservation was made through our company travel bureau.[SEP]when we looked it up on trip advisor we saw that it had good reviews and were very content.[SEP]the inn provided a car service to pick us up from the airport, when we arrived they were very friendly and helpful.[SEP]they gave great suggestions for restaurants.[SEP]omar suggested and made the reservation for a great italian place up the road that we went to, i can't recall name (ugh), anyhoo it was awesome.[SEP]you can't beat the location in the heart of union square.[SEP]rooms are small, bathroom is small but very, very nice.[SEP]housekeeping was great always left water bottle and chocolates (a good thing).[SEP]a small continental breakfast buffet was layed out every morning on 2 separate floors along with wine and cheese for cocktail hour (5 - 7).[SEP]it's a small quaint hotel in a great location, we recommended colleagues to stay and they loved it.[SEP]we would stay again.
1	i am a french teacher and went to paris with my father in june.[SEP]unfortunately, the second day that i was there i hurt my back and had to stay in bed for a large part of the day while my father went out sightseeing by himself.[SEP]he does not speak french and the staff was very helpful to him with their english.[SEP]they were very concerned for my well - being and had people checking on me throughout the day -- they even made me lunch and brought it up![SEP]the room that we had was on the small side, but as we come to paris for sightseeing that isn't really a problem.[SEP]even being in bed half the day was doable.[SEP]the location is great -- right around the corner from the pantheon and notre dame.[SEP]it is extremely safe in this neighborhood.[SEP]breakfast is included in the price of the hotel, which is convenient given how expensive the city can be.[SEP]the staff is a mishmash of ethnicities -- pierre works in the kitchen and is originally from poland, while mamoune and mohammed are from morocco.[SEP]fatima the cleaning lady is from algeria.[SEP]they have all been in france for at least 25 years.[SEP]i suggest that you tip them well, because even though they give excellent service they are still not paid enough to live the lifestyle that we travelers afford while we are on vacation.[SEP]i know they would appreciate it!
1	we visited the crystal beach hotel for 5 days in july.[SEP]service was excellent.... rooms were clean and the staff very friendly.[SEP]very convenient location... private parking garage that connects to the hotel 3rd floor.[SEP]located at the non - crowded end of the boardwalk so it was quiet and the beach area was huge.[SEP]we will return.
1	we combined business (conference) with pleasure in a recent trip to san francisco and this hotel fit our bill perfectly.[SEP]i rode the powell street cable car down to make it to the convention centre and my fiance rode the opposite way to fisherman's wharf, etc.[SEP]we booked the hotel because of the recommendations on trip advisor and were not disappointed.[SEP]our room was spacious and quirky with separate dressing area (with sink and large mirror), washroom (compact but clean) and a bar with fridge in a converted closet.[SEP]gas fireplace added ambiance.[SEP]the decor is very " flowery ", but reminiscent of an old english inn (which is the look i believe they aspired to).[SEP]breakfast was very good and convenient and the wine and cheese receptions in the in the evenings were also very much appreciated.[SEP]tips.... if you get a room on the street, while not noisy, it does have typical traffic sounds that you wouldn't get on the 20th floor of a high - rise hotel.[SEP]location is safe, two blocks from cable car (if you take bart into town as we did), don't walk up to hotel from powell street station... take a cab!, the hill is steep.[SEP]staff were friendly, helpful and knowledgable.[SEP]all in all a highly recommended hotel.
1	nice beds![SEP]this hotel is in a great location for pier 39 and access to other attractions!the hotel was warm and inviting, the staff were friendly and helpful.[SEP]the room was of a good size and the bathroom was clean and spacious.[SEP]the bed was so comfy, i didn't want to get out of it, the best bed i have slept in![SEP]the bar area is ok and the restaurant we didn't see.[SEP]there is so mush to do in san fran that we spent most of our time out of the room![SEP]but definitely a good place to pitch up for the night!
1	this hotel in a fabulous location: close enough to main attractions, but on a fairly quiet yet vibrant street near the latin quarter.[SEP]we were able to walk almost anywhere and especially enjoyed wandering the charming neighborhood at night.[SEP]the rooms were small, but clean.[SEP]what set this hotel apart from others for me was the staff.[SEP]everyone was friendly and helpful and had a big smile on his or her face.[SEP]i must admit i was a little worried about the reported disdain the french have for americans.[SEP]but these folks couldn't have been nicer.[SEP]we paid 1/2 of what we could have for some of the " big name " hotels in paris.[SEP]hopefully one day we will be back!
1	plus: 1.[SEP]great location just steps from restaurants and shopping 2.[SEP]beautiful rooftop bar with spectacular views 3.[SEP]great restaurant in the hotel 4.[SEP]showers are big and modern 5.[SEP]beds are very very compfortable minus: 1.[SEP]rooftop bar staff all have attitudes and rarely smile (no joke) 2.[SEP]there is a two inch gap between your room door and the floor so late afternoon / early evening you can hear all types of noise in the hallways.[SEP]to the hotels credit they keep the housekeeping staff pretty quiet during the morning hours so its not too bad.[SEP]3.[SEP]concierge doesn't have a clue.[SEP]recommends places that were " in " about 3 years ago.[SEP]if you want to get advice on new and fun places to hit just go up to the roof and talk to the locals (many of them have access to the bar with no membership but who cares).[SEP]4.[SEP]the hotel is starting to look warn out.[SEP]this is a cool place and i would stay again (but only in the mid to upper $200s / night.......
1	my husband and i stayed at hotel 47 in mid - may, and really loved the location!![SEP]the hotel is so close to the colosseum, forum, palantine hill, etc (which i've heard referred to as the historical district)... the area has a really nice feel and look about it.[SEP]it's also very close to trastevere on the other side of the tiber, which we loved, and is a wonderful area for dinner / drinks or just wandering around.[SEP]we also found the location of 47 to be a convenient distance from all the other sites of interest... trevi, pantheon... even the vatican... as other posters have noted, the hotel is very clean and modern... rooms are well maintained and well - equipped... with a luxury feel... staff was friendly... only criticism i will make is that we were introduced to the concierge upon arrival, but never saw her again during our stay... however, the staff at the front desk were available and accommodating for any questions we had... so it really wasn't a big deal by any means... also, i have to add that we thought the breakfast was very very good compared to the other 4 hotels we stayed at during our trip to italy, and we didn't notice any road noise at all, as mentioned by other posters.[SEP]we had a great stay at 47, and will definitely return!![SEP]i wouldn't stay anywhere else...
1	this hotel is really amazing the minute you walk into it.[SEP]it is beautifully decorated and the room was spacious which is unusual for italy.[SEP]we enjoyed the location but it was a bit loud at times since our room overlooked the neighboring hard rock cafe.[SEP]i felt for a 5 star hotel we should have recieved better service.[SEP]although there were exceptions, most of the people at the front desk were unfriendly and not helpful.[SEP]also at breakfast, we felt like we were intruding and they did not make us feel welcome at all.[SEP]we were able to overlook these things as we really did enjoy our room and our location.
1	stayed here for new year.[SEP]on arrival it is a fantastic location, very central for everything.[SEP]lobby was very busy for the full duration of stay.[SEP]hallways very dull and grubby.[SEP]bedroom was basic and quite dull, but clean and tidy.[SEP]most of the staff were friendly and courteous apart from a few, which was typical of new york.[SEP]if returning to new york i probably wouldn't book this hotel again, but the location is great.[SEP]banchory scotland
1	i would like to compliment four seasons on the exemplary service we received during our recent stay in sydney.[SEP]it was an excellent location in the heart of city center.[SEP]as this is our first time in sydney, your staff upgraded us to the 16th floor harbour view room where we get to see the illumination of the sails at the opera house.[SEP]the attention to details was impeccable.[SEP]service of this caliber is rare these days and i wanted to be sure that you knew how impressed we were.[SEP]please extend my compliments to your staff.[SEP]you have truly made our holiday truly memorable.
1	when i booked this hotel for a 1 night stay i was not excited about the location (preference was north michigan avenue), but i was pleasantly surprised.[SEP]the rooms, and restaurant were very nice.[SEP]access to grant park was extremely convenient.[SEP]the room was ~$200/night, which was about $70 dollars less than the north michigan avenue.[SEP]$10 cab ride to shopping area was not a big deal at all.[SEP]consider as a great value hotel in downtown chicago.
1	my husband and i stayed at the sheraton for 5 nights in late march / early april for a conference.[SEP]we were checked in promptly and received a room on the 45th floor.[SEP]we had a nice, clean room with views of times square.[SEP]the location is extremely convenient to shopping and broadway.[SEP]we were running late for our flight when checking out.[SEP]we were able to check out at the kiosk and the doorman was very kind.[SEP]he got us a taxi right away and shared we needed to get to laguardia asap.[SEP]overall, we had a great experience in nyc and at the sheraton.
1	perfect location in downtown seattle walking dostance to dining, shopping, pretty much any thing in dt.[SEP]rooms are very dated, reletively small bathrooms and paper thin walls.[SEP]could hear when the room next door using their bathroom![SEP]free coffe in the lobby early in the morning (6 to 8) was a nice touch.[SEP]if you become a kimpton memebr (its free) you can use wifi for free.[SEP]for the price paid, i've stayed in better hotels in seattle.[SEP]a printed list in the washroon tells you what items you can get for free in the hotel, that lst include shower cap, toothbrush,.... you'll find a toothbrush in your room too, but if you use it you must pay for it, the list in the washroom refers to the toothbrush you should have asked for from the house keeping not the one already put in your room![SEP]that one you should pay for!
1	this is a lovely hotel in an excellent location.[SEP]beautifully furnished and very clean.[SEP]good quality toiletries by l'occitane, big towels, fluffy bath robes, very comfortable beds with lovely linens, high quality fittings in the bathroom, free and fast wifi.[SEP]we loved the plate of the parisian speciality macaroons in our room on arrival.[SEP]the staff were friendly and helpful.[SEP]we were upgraded to a deluxe room which was a nice suprise ; but it wasn't huge so i think the regular rooms must be pretty small.[SEP]we like the toilet being separate from the bathroom.[SEP]the over bath shower was excellent.
1	i was very pleased with this hotel.[SEP]i was not familiar with the area nor do i speak german.[SEP]the front desk was friendly and accommodating.[SEP]the rooms were nice and this hotel has a great location.[SEP]i would stay here again.
1	we arrived at this hotel late at night, and i was without a suitcase as it did not arrive with my flight, but none of this phased them- the front desk was helpful considering the time of night.[SEP]the room, however, was a disappointment![SEP]whilst we had only paid for a single room, it was so small that i could place a hand on each wall, the tv was tiny, the decor was dated and the bed was like a camp bed![SEP]breakfast was fair, though nothing special.[SEP]to their credit, they did give both me and my friend a much bigger, double room each after the first 2 nights, they kept me informed on my missing luggage, they were helpful with directions, and the location was very good for both the termini station, and all the sights.
1	two of us stayed at the harbor court for 3 nights fri, sat, sun in october.[SEP]we stayed for the good rate we got and its location close to the ferry building... great food.[SEP]we had a " corner " room 610 queen bed " overlooking " steuart st, but there is only one window overlooking the air conditioning unit of the building.[SEP]the window opens.[SEP]the unit on the roof is not noisy during the day, but i found it a bit irritating at night and slept with the tv on all night to disguise the sound.[SEP]room was clean and housekeeping honored our note for extra towels.[SEP]the desk chair was an impediment to getting to the bathroom, so i moved it between the entry door and the bathroom door.[SEP]there are 2 drawers in the platform bed and a small armoir for hanging clothes with ironing board, iron.[SEP]there are 2 electrical outlets right on the desk.[SEP]lights with dimmer switches at both sides of bed, light on armoir, desk lamp.[SEP]lobby coffee in the morning was fine.[SEP]we bought bread at the ferry building to go with our morning coffee.[SEP]if i stayed here again, i would book a bay view room for the light and nice view.
1	we arrived prior to check - in time, soaking wet and hoping (not expecting) a room might be available.[SEP]we were told we should come back around 1300 when a room might be available.[SEP]when we did return, we were told no room was available and we ’d have to wait until 1400.[SEP]at other holiday inn hotels i have never experienced this - and despite being a priority club member (which i later discovered is worth nothing at this hotel), we felt we were treated with contempt - ie.[SEP]how dare we arrive and expect a room would be available prior to 1400 (advertised check - in time).[SEP]the girl on the front desk when we arrived was one of the rudest person's on a check - in desk we have ever come across.[SEP]the housekeeping was appalling - coffee and milk was not replenished during our 4 night stay.[SEP]our room (611) was small, bathroom was too small - and as others have written, there is nowhere to place toiletries.[SEP]the shower recess is too small, meaning water spray goes all over the floor.[SEP]style over substance?[SEP]view from room was good, view from rooftop terrace even better.[SEP]the best thing about this hotel is the location - so many cafes and restaurants within easy walking distance, and plenty of souvenir shops also.[SEP]it is close to metro and rer.[SEP]to be honest, these things are the hotel's saving grace.
1	the hotel is in a perfect location for your vacation in sd.[SEP]they have a great roof top bar that you can watch the baseball games from.[SEP]you are several blocks from everything and a short ride from the airport.[SEP]the staff worked with my wife to setup a great trip.[SEP]the room was clean and the staff made sure to serivce our every need while on our trip.[SEP]i thought the rooms for a marriott were a bit small but we did nt spend much time in the room.
1	received an offer from travelzoo for hotel and wine tour package.[SEP]was a great deal![SEP]front desk person was so nice and really helpful with lots of ideas of things to do and where to eat.[SEP]great personality![SEP]room was nice and clean.[SEP]stairs outside need some work but all in all, it was reasonable, clean and worth the trip.[SEP]beautiful area as well.[SEP]location is a little out of town but not too much.
1	this was a perfect location for a holiday trip.[SEP]i enjoyed a girls' weekend here.[SEP]the front desk staff were quite friendly and we were able to get all the tourist information [ maps, tours etc ] at a moment's notice.[SEP]the room was clean and comfortable.[SEP]we got it on special as we booked well in advance.[SEP]do not expect a breathtaking view as there are high rise buildings all around but you can not beat it for location.[SEP]it is one street away from a subway also for those who wish to take longer trips.[SEP]i would definitely recommend it again.
1	room booked with quickbook.com, excellent location and value for money.[SEP]spacious room with all amenities including fridge, microwave, kettle and tea![SEP]and much to my partners delight live premier league football![SEP]tip of the day....... service lift buttons above eye level... press them and they arrive much quicker![SEP]all in all can not fault any aspect of our stay at the flatotel!
1	second stay here.[SEP]will be back.[SEP]brilliant location within walking distance of british museum and covent garden.[SEP]room clean and comfortable.[SEP]reception was extremely helpful and courteous.[SEP]called a few minutes after we were in the room to see if we wanted anything else.[SEP]didn't eat in the restaurant or use the bar this time - but the last time we did both were excellent.[SEP]didn't bother with breakfast in hotel so can't comment on that.[SEP]lovely corner room with some slight street noise but nothing too bad.
1	i'll try to keep it short and sweet... the hotel is perfect.[SEP]central to everything from shops, to dam square to coffee shops..[SEP]if you wanna give it a try.[SEP]but be warned..[SEP]its much more potent than that stuff you tried at a party one time![SEP]blows the head clean off you!:) -~ very clean, very central, and is the best hotel i have stayed in for quite a while.[SEP]only small thing i could complain about, is at the time of writing, the hotel bar is still closed for renovations.[SEP]but once that s done, it will be top notch.[SEP]will definately stay here again.[SEP]just a stroll down to dam squre, where you could happily sit for hours with just a couple of drinks, and watch all the people and bikes go by.[SEP]chilled out city.[SEP]i could nt be bothered ever trying to beat this hotel for value, location and cleanliness.[SEP]so stop searching for ages on trip advisor![SEP]this is the place to stay, wether you are a couple, a family or a group of friends.[SEP]and amsterdam has something for everyone.[SEP]enjoy!
1	i visited paris for the weekend to watch the finale of the six nations rugby, the hotel was booked by friends as they had stayed there in the past and liked it.[SEP]i must say i was not disappointed.[SEP]the location is fantastic, a mere 10 euro cab fare from gare du nord and within walking distance of the champs de elysees and arc de triomphe.[SEP]the staff were very friendly and spoke good english.[SEP]i initially spoke to them in french but upon hearing my accent they were more than happy to converse in english with me.[SEP]the boutique nature of the hotel is fantastic, especially if you want a quiet weekend away, there were only four rooms on my floor.[SEP]my room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was very modern and was immaculate with a fantastic shower that was akin to standing under a waterfall.[SEP]i also had an electronic safe which isn't always present in three star hotels.[SEP]the owner of the hotel was brilliant and recommended a great restaurant a friend of his owned around the corner, he also wrote us a note to hand to the maitre'd and as a result we got a very good discount on a great meal.[SEP]the only downside was that the breakfast wasn't worth the money but there are plenty of places to eat within walking distance so this isn't a major issue.[SEP]all in all, a very high quality little three star hotel!
1	chose the hotel for location and pool.[SEP]however, pool was closed for renovation.[SEP]you can use the westin's pool (5 blocks away) or pay money to use a club.[SEP]the beds are nice, but that's about it.[SEP]rooms and hallways are a bit grim and dark, and none of the drains in the bathrooms worked properly.[SEP]needed late checkout, but was told the hotel was too full, which is fine but then they magically made a room available for a few hours for $50.[SEP]but the key stopped working anyway.[SEP]this was my first stay at a sheraton and i won't be doing it again, especially for over $200.
1	this pretiest small hotel is situated in sultanahmet district for a few minute walking from the most historical sites in istanbul.[SEP]it was the best location i have knew ever.[SEP]my room had normal size and very clean and nice decorated.[SEP]ah yes, there are small sweet balconies in the each room.[SEP]my one had two balconies.[SEP]the bed was very comfortable.[SEP]this hotel have close and open terrace on the roof wä±th a wonderful view on marmara sea.[SEP]breakfast was tasteful and after it i could walking untill afternoon without any problem.[SEP]especially i want to notice cheese and olives and also honey.[SEP]staff was extremally helpfull and nice, always with smiles.[SEP]i would wish to stay there again and again.[SEP]i can recommend this hotel for everybody who needs simple, but comfortable rest.[SEP]and i grateful to host mehmet kaya and his assistants very much.[SEP]ã‡ok teåÿekkã¼r ederim, her zaman kutlu olunuz.
1	we needed somewhere to stay for about 3 weeks while we waited to move into a new home.[SEP]location was perfect for us and the price was right![SEP]we ended up leaving after three days.[SEP]the windows didn't shut so we were kept awake with traffic noise all night.[SEP]the hotel is on a very busy road.[SEP]the curtains didn't cover the windows either so we had street lights shining in our window.[SEP]the bed was narrow, uncomfortable and clammy.[SEP]bleh![SEP]the bathroom was unclean.[SEP]the whole room was clearly very old and run down ; in desperate need of a refurb.[SEP]staying there for us while trying to work and live our daily lives was uncomfortable and depressing.[SEP]we've both travelled on a shoestring many times and have never encountered anything so substandard.[SEP]don't ruin your holiday to save a few pounds - stay somewhere else!
1	excellent location within a few blocks of north michigan ave shopping and tourist attractions like the hard rock cafe and rainforest cafe.[SEP]includes full breakfast each morning and happy hour in the afternoon.[SEP]breakfast and happy hour can be busy, so expect a little wait.[SEP]our kids loved the indoor pool too.[SEP]the rooms are a great size for families.[SEP]there is a bedroom on one end and a living area with a pullout sofa and chair on the other separated by a wet bar area with a mini fridge and microwave.[SEP]we felt it was a great value and a great location.[SEP]perfect for our family![SEP]we would definitely stay again.
1	first of all it is in an excellent location.[SEP]the staff were helpful and polite.[SEP]although the room was on the small side it was very clean here.[SEP]the bathroom was nice though and had a great shower.[SEP]we did not try the breakfast so i am unable to comment on that.[SEP]there was a strange semll in the lift at times not that itfollwed us to the inside of our room.[SEP]there is satellite tv but there wereonly two or three english speaking channels amongst the hundreds available.[SEP]they gave us a charming present of apple tea and some glasses along with some turkish delight wehn we departed.
1	my husband booked this hotel as a surprise for my 30th birthday and i have to say that i was very impressed with his choice.[SEP]i work in travel, so am picky about hotels and i have to say i really enjoyed my stay.[SEP]hotel design was stunning and the location was perfect.[SEP]rooms were nice and the different light settings were a nice touch.[SEP]yes, there was a bit of noise from the street outside, but i expected that due to location.[SEP]there is no noise from anything within the hotel.[SEP]staff were really helpful and did what they could when we were stranded in barcelona due to heathrow being closed.[SEP]my favourite bit was the rooftop pool and the indoor pool with jets.[SEP]it was so nice to relax and get away from all the chaos on the ramblas.[SEP]all in all fantastic!
1	my partner and i stayed at the bellagio the week before christmas.[SEP]we had visited vegas some 3 years ago and always said that we would stay at the bellagio if we returned so we did.[SEP]check - in was speedy and all our questions were answered.[SEP]we had booked a lakeside room and we were not disappointed, we had a wonderful view and a lovely room.[SEP]we enjoyed meals at the cafe bellagio, the bellagio buffet and prime.[SEP]the only comment i would make is that the staff at prime were very much full of their own self - importance, even more so than those at quality restaurants in the uk![SEP]we saw' o', our first cirque de soleil show, and were really impressed with the acrobatics.[SEP]the only disappointment we had in our entire week was around a helicopter trip to the grand canyon.[SEP]we booked this through the bellagio concierge with maverick.[SEP]our helicopter developed a " technical problem " on the way to the grand canyon and we had to return to base.[SEP]the intenton was to put us on another helicopter but that one turned out to have a flat battery - we took this as a sign that we were not meant to go!![SEP]however, maverick provided a full refund without question.[SEP]we would certainly return to the bellagio - the quality is superb and its in an ideal location to explore the rest of the strip hotels.
1	we just returned from a lovely stay at the hotel commonwealth.[SEP]the location is terrific.[SEP]having never stayed in boston i was delighted to be located within walking distance to many poplular destinations but not so close to be bothered by traffic noises, etc.[SEP]the hotel is steps away from the t for further venturing.[SEP]the staff was wonderful, quite accommodating.[SEP]the rooms are classic and stylish, request one with a view.[SEP]we were there for the marathon which runs right in front of the hotel... perfect!
1	location is fantastic - in the arty, museum district of dosoduro.[SEP]even if not an art buff, the gallery displays make for an interestingly and delightful walk to the hotel from the vapouretta stop, which is only a few minutes walk away.[SEP]we stayed in the new dinesen apartments which were modern, new and very comfortable and stylish.[SEP]so in terms of the things that matter in a hotel, room and location, couldn't reccomend more highly.[SEP]just a few annoying things, which the hotel could improve on: - there was no lift, so we had to lug our bags up 2 floors.[SEP]- breakfast is cold continental only.[SEP]choice was limited, coffe was bad and fruit salad not refilled.[SEP]go to a local cafe instead.[SEP]- they have this silly system where they don't give you the key.[SEP]have to go to reception, everytime we want to go to our room.[SEP]sounds fine in theory, but many times we had to wait for more than 5 minutes for someone at reception - we closed thw windows and house keeping always opened them back up - letting in mozzies
1	we stayed here for 4 nights in sep’10.[SEP]all reviews in tripadvisor is true![SEP]we love this hotel & their roof top terrace!![SEP]we had a comfortable room with balcony on the top floor.[SEP]algergo del senator – a beautiful hotel, great location near to all the major attractions (within walking distance), friendly staff.[SEP]received complimentary champagne as birthday gift from the hotel during the stay.[SEP]will back for the same hotel in my next trip to rome.
1	my husband and i stayed at the bellagio in june.[SEP]this hotel is absolutely beautiful.[SEP]the pools were my favorite i could have spent a week there alone.[SEP]the only downside was the buffet.[SEP]the food and service were both horrible.[SEP]i would stay at bellagio again since the location and hotel itself is beautiful, but i would go somewhere else to eat.
1	this hotel was a no frills hotel, however ; was a great location![SEP]the wellington was a basic hotel, great value, and was right next to a subway station, which would take you anywhere![SEP]if you walked out of your hotel one way you were a few blocks from the middle of times square, the other way a few blocks from central park.[SEP]the location was perfect![SEP]we walked and/or took the subway wherever.[SEP]the employees in the gift shop were pretty knowledgable on tourist attractions (i.e statue of liberty, etc) the hotel employees, conceirge, etc were all pretty friendly![SEP]the only downfall was the staff at their diner.[SEP]they were not friendly or observant![SEP]i would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great location, great value, no frills hotel.[SEP]the beds were comfy and we were upgraded to a suite for free at check in!
1	after reading these reviews i was cautious about booking this hotel.[SEP]but we needed lots of space for our family trip to nyc for thanksgiving weekend.[SEP]this hotel was the best choice.[SEP]it seems to be an apt complex converted to a hotel which means you will have lots of space compared to manhattan hotels.[SEP]the rooms were dated.[SEP]for example the tile in the bathroom seemed to be from the sixties.[SEP]and the furniture seemed to be appropriate for a house and not a hotel.[SEP]however the room was clean.[SEP]the service was excellent.[SEP]the location was great (about 5 blks from the subway).[SEP]and the value unbeatable.[SEP]i suggest those who need turn down service and modern furnishings--- this is not the hotel for you.[SEP]but if you want to save money, have a comfortable place for 4+++ adults to sleep and don't mind a basic hotel, book it![SEP]ps.[SEP]if you pay in a advance for a discounted rate, you will not be charged until you actually check in ;-)
1	i was very leery of this hotel after reading the reviews, but my swiss friend booked it for us, so i plugged my nose and jumped in.[SEP]glad i did![SEP]we had a very quiet room that had pleasant views.[SEP]the breakfast was great.[SEP]it was a few minutes' walk to the trevi fountain, and it wasn't that tiny, especially for a european hotel.[SEP]i would definitely stay here again.[SEP]yes the tv is small but we never turned it on so that was not an issue.[SEP]also the bathroom was nice with fresh looking blue tile.[SEP]there was some mildew (very tiny bit) but who the heck cares you're in rome!!![SEP]and the service was better than the ‘ 4 star’ hotel i got stuck in when my flight got delayed – they carried our bags up to our room and were pleasant throughout the stay.[SEP]i'm giving this an above average rating because for the money, we had a great location, a comfortable, quiet room, friendly service, and a hearty breakfast.
1	we had a two night stay on our way home from australia to switzerland.[SEP]after a long flight with two small children the welcoming porters opening the car doors at the pan pacific were a nice sight to see.[SEP]we were made welcome from the 1st second we arrived.[SEP]i changed our room type at the front desk which the receptionist organised with no problems in a matter of seconds.[SEP]our room was clean, modern and comfortable with a great view to the harbour.[SEP]room service was excellent, the breakfast buffet was plentiful, although the resturant felt closed in to me as there was no windows or terrace.[SEP]it is very much the city hotel and geared to business travellers.[SEP]but it suited us just fine and we were well catered for.[SEP]the baby cot was delivered to the room with the turn down service and placed in the location i requested.[SEP]the children were given lovely tolietry sets with toys which i am now using at home as the quality is excellent.[SEP]the pool area was well set out and large.[SEP]our transfer back to the airport went like clockwork.[SEP]we were also able to stay in our room until the evening.[SEP]all in all it was an excellent property managed professionally.
1	we have stayed in this hotel many times and have always been very pleased with everything.[SEP]the location is perfect, right in the middle of marais, close to rue rivoli (but not so close that the traffic is disturbing).[SEP]the staff is great, always helpful, giving directions, making restaurant reservations, etc.[SEP]rooms are small but very nicely decorated with old furniture, a small pot with flowers and bathrobes.[SEP]internet is excellent and free.[SEP]be sure to have breakfast in the hotel.[SEP]it ’s delicious with yoghurt, a kiwi, three types of jam, baguette, croissant, pain au chocolate and a big pot of really nice coffee.[SEP]this is without doubt our favorite hotel in paris!
1	we stayed at the fairmont heritage place for six nights during our girls spring break.[SEP]the place is awesome.[SEP]we stayed on the mustard terrace in a two bedroom with views of the bay and alcatraz..[SEP]there was a fire pit right outside our door that we enjoyed every night.[SEP]the staff here was wonderful.[SEP]we loved the convenience of the location.[SEP]we walked everywhere![SEP]the continental breakfast was great.[SEP]my girls thought this was the neatest place they had ever stayed.[SEP]we will go back to this hotel anytime we are in san francisco.
1	we really enjoyed the mayflower park hotel.[SEP]from our check - in to our check - out the staff was outstanding the hotel beautifully maintained.[SEP]our original room had only one hight stand and reading light and we asked for a different room.[SEP]robert the desk clerk, was very acomodating and cheked around until he found a room that would work.[SEP]the hotel is a historic hotel of america and is truly a gem.[SEP]the location is fantastic.[SEP]it is connected to a shopping center, however, the entrance is so hidden that yo would not know it was there.[SEP]the monorail station is in the center so it is very convenient to get to the space needle.[SEP]you can walk to restaurants and shopping.[SEP]we actually stayed here 2 times on our trip.[SEP]one night on our way to the jan juans, and 2 nights after we returned.[SEP]we had 2 different rooms and both were beautifully appointed with all the amenities.[SEP]the staff is very friendly and helpful.[SEP]we truly enjoyed our stay at the mayflower park hotel.
1	really enjoyed the hotel![SEP]it is in a quiet residential side street perfectly located.[SEP]it was less than a 10 min walk from arc de triomphe and 5 min from rer & metro.[SEP]hotel also located less than 2 min from velib bicycle stand - took 2 min with a bicycle to get to arc de triomphe and another 5 to grand palace.[SEP]staff was very helpful and always smiling.[SEP]chambermaids were also very helpful adn friendly.[SEP]breakfast was wonderful - much more than expected for a european hotel.[SEP]wifi worked very well and always available.[SEP]the bar was very reasonable - also had nice restaurants and bistros in a very close location.
1	great location next to the gardens.[SEP]room was not big, but well furnished and tastefully decorated.[SEP]the glass shower was neat.[SEP]we could hear the elevator from our room, so you might want to ask to be away from them if this might bother you.[SEP]valet parking only and it's a steep 48$/day.[SEP]good service overall, maids were especially courteous.
1	i spent a long time on tripadvisor researching hotels in paris and settled on this one.[SEP]it was a great choice.[SEP]the staff were lovely (they actually replied to me in french so that i got to practice, but speak english too of course), the location was great.[SEP]sure, the room is small, but not the smallest i've stayed in.[SEP]it's totally functional and who is wasting their time in paris hanging out in their hotel room anyway?[SEP]we did not have breakfast at the hotel, but highly recommend salon flirt - the a block away.
1	we were in this hotel for 2 nights and absolutely loved it![SEP]the location is great with the water buses near by (which we came in from airport and the street was straight across from the stop) the staff were very friendly and helpful, the breakfast was also lovely.[SEP]our room was the perfect size for what we were looking for, only small downside was the size / layout of bathroom - in particular the shower cubicle which is very very small (i am 5 ft 10 and partner 6 ft 4!!) but the actual shower and water pressure was great![SEP]our room for us in particular was great due to having some steps that folded down from the window which then led up to a small private decked terrace with table and chairs - we loved this - especially enjoying a bottle of wine at night after having dinner and stroll along along the water front![SEP](it is in amongst the other buildings so no view but lovely, peaceful and romantic!) we loved venice, probably our favorite out of the cities we visited on this trip (which included florence and rome) and are definately planning to go back for a longer stay and will definately book this hotel and hopefully the same room!!
1	spent a delightful 5 days here.[SEP]had 2 days of biz in downtown la and decided to add some time on either side of that.[SEP]love the location in little tokyo.[SEP]staff very helpful and friendly.[SEP]housekeeping was lovely and on top of all details.[SEP]had excellent experience at hair salon in hotel, and i can not give high enough reviews for the shiatsu massage.[SEP]truly exceptional massage at the health spa facility which is on the hotel property, but a separate entity from hotel.[SEP]superlative sushi close by too.
1	this is my fourth trip to barcelona.[SEP]the hotel i used to stay with did not allow booking 7 months out, so i checked out my alternatives.[SEP]after searching tripadvisor, i decided to try hotel jazz.[SEP]i am glad i did, as this one is more central, easier to get to from airport, and cheaper![SEP]the aerobus from airport is conveniently located one floor below arrival level of terminal 1 (or a?) and runs every 5 - 10 minutes, depending on whether it fills up quickly.[SEP]fare is only 5.1 euros.[SEP]the bus stops just above the metro station universidad, which is less than half a block from hotel jazz.[SEP]we asked for a quiet room and was assigned 7th floor.[SEP]i can understand a lower floor being bothered by the rumbling noise from a passing metro, as i can even feel (hear) it on occasion in my room.[SEP]front desk service is superior, check in process swift.[SEP]room cleaniness and amenties fitting for a four star.[SEP]bed very comfortable.[SEP]location is what we wanted, as it is just two blocks west of la rambla and near many attractions.[SEP]the very large department store el cortes, just north of la ramblas, has a large grocery section in the lower floor, ideal for making a light meal to eat in the hotel.
1	we stayed here for 9 nights on our honeymoon in a standard room with a queen bed.[SEP]the room was on the small side but was very clean and comfortable and had everything we needed.[SEP]the best thing about the hotel is the union square location.[SEP]if you haven't been to san fran before then i would recommend it as somewhere to stay as you are near to everything![SEP]lots of shops, restaurants and sights are only a short walk away.[SEP]despite the central location we found the hotel to be very quiet (we were on the 20th floor) which was a pleasant surprise.[SEP]the staff and service we encountered were good although if the concierge is busy then don't bother asking the reception staff instead - although friendly they weren't particularly knowledgable about local services and transport![SEP]the pool area is a bonus although be aware there is a charge for this (think it was 20 dollar per room per stay which was nt bad really).[SEP]we did nt eat in the hotel but had drinks in the hotel bar which is lovely (but pricey).[SEP]overall i think this hotel is a great place to stay if you are looking for a central location from which to explore the city.
1	the holiday inn express, not to be confused with the nearby holiday inn is a good, basic, clean hotel in a great location only about 4 minutes walk to fisherman's wharf and great places to eat, as well as the f muni line.[SEP]in particular: 1.[SEP]friendly service at check - in.[SEP]2.[SEP]rooms are clean.[SEP]3.[SEP]bed is comfortable.[SEP]i suffer from a sore back so i should know.[SEP]4.[SEP]breakfast is provided for free.[SEP]it is basic, consisting of various cereals, fruit, coffee and tea, juices, pastries, eggs and bacon and other meats, bread, toast and spreads.[SEP]served between 6.30 and 8.30, get there early or you'll find it hard to get a table.[SEP]5.[SEP]free wifi is provided in the lobby.[SEP]this had download and upload speeds of about 7mb / s.[SEP]it dropped out sometimes on my ipad.[SEP]rooms also have cable internet.[SEP]6.[SEP]my room didn't have a fridge, but you are provided with an ice bucket and there is a free ice - vending machine.[SEP]7.[SEP]shower pressure is not high but it heats up quickly.[SEP]all in all, a nice experience.[SEP]i was there from 21 - 25 september, 2011.
1	i am a frequent traveler.[SEP]mostly for work.[SEP]as stated by other reviewers, yes this is a large hotel.[SEP]running down to the front desk will take you a good 10 mins.[SEP]but man is it a gorgeous & scenic walk.[SEP]everything is very high tech & the decor is amazing.[SEP]the location itself is off the beaten path a bit but if you don't mind a little walking then you won't need a car.[SEP]10 - 15 mins by foot to canal and bourbon street.[SEP]30ish to the french market area (which was our fav) part of town.[SEP]the rooms were spacious & beautifully decorated.[SEP]the bed is very comfortable.[SEP]the highlight for me though was the service.[SEP]everyone was incredibly friendly and really made us feel 5 star.[SEP]special shout out to our bellman johnathan.[SEP]this guy deserves a promotion![SEP]he took at least 20 mins to explain the city to us, making recommendations on places to go, where to eat & much more.[SEP]he was just amazing.[SEP]my company will be holding the same conference again next june and i'm already looking forward to it.[SEP]this was my 1st trip to nola and this might very well be the only hotel i ever stay at.[SEP]the bar was raised just that high....
1	how nice to find such a gem in a city of tourist hotels, some good, some bad and most of them just plain overpriced.[SEP]we found this hotel to be an ideal tourist base.[SEP]well staffed, multi - lingual reception and well prepared rooms together with an excellent breakfast all combined to make our three day stay very enjoyable.[SEP]a great location 20 minutes (but you will take longer) walk through piazza del popolo to the trevi fountain via spanish steps and on the edge of the borghese villa & gardens.[SEP]100 metres from the metro for vatican etc.[SEP]we were four in party and found local taxis inexpensive and very easy for dining or just escaping the crowds and going back to the hotel.[SEP]the hotel has an unprepossessing exterior and small rooms but, as another correspondent commented, you are in rome so why spend time in your room, for heavens sake!
1	we stayed here over the christmas period and found it was in an excellent location for the christmas markets and was really central for pretty much everything.[SEP]this was really important for us when choosing the location of the hotel due to my mum's limited ability to walk any distance.[SEP]so location alone was first class for us.[SEP]the rooms are of a superior five star standard, very clean and modern and bedding and towels were changed every day with a turn down service at night.[SEP]the bathroom was excellent offering a seperate shower and large bath with quality fixtures and fittings, again spotessly clean.[SEP]we found the beds very comfortable complete with featherbed toppers and high thread count sheets and we were able to sleep really well each night of our stay.[SEP]even though the hotel is centrally located we never heard anything going on outside or within the hotel itself.[SEP]the staff were extremely helpful and friendly and nothing was too much bother for them.[SEP]they were so helpful arranging transfers, making reservations etc for us, and the fact that neither of us spoke any german did not pose a problem due to the multilingual staff.[SEP]everyone was lovely, the bellboy, doorman, concierge, reception staff.[SEP]i can not fault any of them.[SEP]we ate in the pasta place downstairs a couple of evenings which i would highly recommend, and when we return to berlin i would definitely stay here again.[SEP]the only downside for us was the lack of swimming pool, which we would have definitely used had it been there.
1	initially had difficulty making a reservation as i was using a certificate i had previously purchased.[SEP]however the reservation agent, think her name was lorraine, made some calls and with amanda's help was able to get us a room.[SEP]when we arrived we we given a king room on the 21st floor with a great view of the empire state building.[SEP]room was tastefully decorated with ample room to move around for the two of us.[SEP]loved the location, close to penn station, which made it easy to use the subway for transprotation.[SEP]we had wanted to stay in the chelsea neighborhood, away from times square on this trip and we were happy with the location.[SEP]only negative of the trip was the bar basque restaurant, located in the hotel.[SEP]we went there for tapas and drinks.[SEP]the drinks were tasty, but the tapas were a disappointment.[SEP]we tried some of the croquettes, the wild mushroom and the suckling pig.[SEP]each plate had 4 bite size pieces, expected a little more for the price, even if it is new york.[SEP]couldn't find the pork in the suckling pigs ones and the mushroom ones tatsed like they had cream of mushroom soup in the center, not very appetizing.[SEP]the atmosphere was nice however and staff friendly.[SEP]looking forward to a return trip to further explore the neighborhood.
1	i stayed at the hotel palomar san francisco mainly because i love the hotel palomar washington dc so much.[SEP]unfortunately the san francisco hotel didn't quite live up to my expectations.[SEP]my room was large but just didn't have the ambience to make it a really exceptional stay.[SEP]in terms of location it is great, very close to union square and the large westfield shopping mall on market st.[SEP]the location is also great if you are using public transport to get around.[SEP]i didn't find anything wrong with the hotel per se, it just didn't do enough to entice me back again.[SEP]with so many hotel options in sf, i will keep on looking until i find a favourite.
1	this hotel was extremely great value for money.[SEP]the standart of cleanliness was impeccable and the shower was amazing.[SEP]we had booked an apartment and it fell well below the standard we expected and we really thought that we would have difficulty getting a hotel room.[SEP]however, the man on reception was extremely helpful and gave us an absolutely brilliant deal because we took a " queen " size bed, which would normally be for one, but its the size of a standard british double.[SEP]he was like a breath of fresh air.[SEP]this hotel made, what could have been a dreadful experience on our first trip to rome, into a wonderful experience.[SEP]the location is also very good for metro and termini railway station.[SEP]the breakfast was really good we would stay here again, if we come back to rome.[SEP]thank you to staff at hotel raffaello
1	room: very basic, but clean room.[SEP]had everything you ’d expect but a safe.[SEP]standard basic, no frills room.[SEP]rating: (3.5/5) staff: the staff was hit or miss.[SEP]some were great and very knowledgeable, whilst others had no idea about the simplest things (like what time the shuttle departed for the airport, and did n’t know how to find out) rating: (3.5/5) location: only minutes from the airport, with the free shuttle.[SEP]literally across the street from the city centre mall (landmarks come in handy if you have a taxi driver that ’s only been on the job for a day) only about a 15-minute taxi ride anywhere.[SEP]downside, if you want to lounge by the pool there is n’t one, but you can pay a small fee (never inquired about the price) and go over to the novotel, which is in the same complex only a minute away.[SEP]rating (4/5)
1	my husband and i just returned from a trip to paris for christmas and our anniversary.[SEP]my husband had been to paris before and gave me a list of hotels to choose from.[SEP]we ultimately decided on this hotel.[SEP]as texans, we loved that the hotel was the texas embassy when we were a country and we loved the location.[SEP]when we arrived we were given excellent service.[SEP]we are pretty low maintence guests so there was not much that we asked of the staff but they were always kind and wonderfully helpful when we did need something.[SEP]we had a junior sweet on the first floor, and it was amazing.[SEP]the bed was harder than most but we couldn't stop talking about how comfortable it was and how well we slept.[SEP]we walked nearly everywhere from the place vendome and it was beautifully lit up for christmas time.[SEP]we each had our own bathroom (one in the sitting room and one by our bedroom) there was a room for bathing and getting ready and a closet room for our bags and clothes.[SEP]the furnature was beautiful and the automated lights, sound and curtain system made it feel modern even though we were surrounded by a beautiful older feel.[SEP]unless we hopped over to the ritz, i wouldn't want to stay anywhere else in paris.[SEP]it was like a dream.
1	i don't normally write reviews re hotels but this one deserved it.[SEP]having heard beforehand and perhaps expecting a bit less than a regular w hotel, i was very suprised and pleased.[SEP]the room was small, but just the right size for me - large windows, with a great view and plenty of sunlight.[SEP]ipod dock with an incredible sound system![SEP]great, spacious bathroom with a fantastic showerhead.[SEP]the service was amazing - i forgot my toothbrush and had one delivered within 15 mins at no charge.[SEP]everyone was curteous and friendly, superior to almost every other hotel i have stayed in.[SEP]the food was very expensive but worth not leaving the room for dinner after a tiring day walking around the city.[SEP]very big tv screen.[SEP]the room decorations were a bit hokey but kinda nice:).[SEP]location was great.[SEP]all in all, a great experience.[SEP]one more thing, it was impossible to find a cab anywhere in sf when i was there - the bellboy spent a good 10 mins trying to hail one down for me.[SEP]kudos![SEP]congrats to everyone associated with it.
1	we stayed for four nights - venice itself is a wonderful place to spend a long weekend especially in september when the weather is cooler.[SEP]we booked a suite expecting for the price euro 2800 per night to have accommodation overlooking the canal.[SEP]the first room that we were shown had no view whatsoever apart from the roof of the hotel and surrounding buildings - the second room was marginally better but again with no canal view.[SEP]the decor in the room was ornate and best described as faded elegance - the bed however was clean and extremely comfortable.[SEP]a bag of laundry sat uncollected in the corridor outside our room for the duration of our stay.[SEP]the fruit provided in the room on day one was not replaced.[SEP]the restaurant and adjoining bar are small and unappealing - the staff were offhand and the service was slow and unenthusiastic.[SEP]one of the two lifts was out of order.[SEP]the terrace area to the front of the hotel bordering the canal is a pleasant spot for lunch if ridiculously overpriced the location of the hotel however is excellent and within comfortable walking distance of all the main attactions and shops.[SEP]would i go back to venice - yes would i stay again at the gritti - no.
1	location was great, just a short walk to canal and bourbon street, as well as superdome and casinos.[SEP]hotel staff was friendly and accomodating.[SEP]remodeling interior, which wasn't important to our group of mid 20's party'ers.[SEP]rooms varied in size, all had nice flat screen.[SEP]good bang for your buck.[SEP]i'd stay again.
1	the original hotel (which will remain nameless) was the hotel from _ _ _ it had not been renovated in the past 20years or more.[SEP]it was the kind of place you would not sit down, least of all sleep in.[SEP]in addition, the weather forecast stated snow of 12 " or more.[SEP]image trying to get a hotel in manhattan at the last minute during xmas.[SEP]the hotels were too expensive or sold out.[SEP]we quickly contacted expedia to book a hotel and was fortunate enough to book the sheraton ny hotel & tower in manhattan.[SEP]upon our arrival at the sheraton ny hotel & tower, expedia had not forwarded our confirmation.[SEP]although the hotel was extremely busy, debbie rodriquez, at the front desk saw my frustration and inquired as to how she could help.[SEP]also, she took the initiative to contact the manager, zoe cohen to inquire if she could hold a room for us while awaiting the confirmation from expedia.[SEP]due to the professionalism of debbie, zoe and the location of the sheraton ny hotel and tower (not to mention the cleanliness and comfortable beds) we were able to salvage our getaway and have a wonderful short trip.[SEP]thanks debbie and zoe for a wonderful experience!!![SEP]would i recommend this hotel???[SEP]i already have!!!
1	i am writing this review while a guest at this hotel.[SEP]i was a guest here one week earlier and got no sleep because of a college group convention that was up at all hours of the night.[SEP]now i am here again after being assured at checkout that i would get a quieter room.[SEP]last night i heard loud band music at 11 pm and called down and was told it was a restaurant across the street.[SEP]they offered me a room change and told me there would only be music again on the upcoming saturday night.[SEP]and here i am at 11:49 pm with music blaring in my room from across the street.[SEP]and it's only friday.... had i known this would be a nightly occurrence i would have switched rooms but now here i am again wide awake listening to some bad bad music.[SEP]this is really not a place to stay if you want to sleep.[SEP]it's an old hotel with nothing going for it except location - and with the music across the way that plus is even gone.[SEP]i am in this area frequently but will not make this my home base when i am here.[SEP]old noisy hotel with bad towels.[SEP]leaky faucets and lousy tvs.[SEP]no free wireless even in the lobby.[SEP]overpriced parking and internet access.[SEP]not worth the $$$.
1	my husband i went to visit our daughter who is studying abroad.[SEP]we couldn't have picked a more perfect place to stay.[SEP]it was close to the dorm for international students so the location was perfect for our situation.[SEP]beyond that though this hotel was everything i had read about on tripadvisor.[SEP]it was clean, had a very french feeling, all you would envision of a boutique hotel and the service was wonderful.[SEP]we felt very welcome from the moment we checked in and as we would come and go each member of the staff was friendly and helpful.[SEP]i mentioned to the woman at the desk as i checked out that my daughter was having trouble with her french bank card and she said they would gladly help her work it out - certainly beyond the call of duty as we were leaving.[SEP]our room was spacious, the beds, bedding, towels, robes, etc were very cozy and luxurious.[SEP]our room was cleaned or tidied up several times a day.[SEP]the bar area had a very intimate feeling and the breakfast staff was all you ask for.[SEP]the neighborhood feels very safe and at night we never heard a sound as we slept.[SEP]all in all, our stay was perfect!
1	this hotel is so fabolus, i loved it![SEP]the hotel itself is very beautiful, the service is great, the rooms were big, the hotel has 6 retstaurants, spa, boutiques, large pools, casino and everything you can ask for.[SEP]our room had to large queenbeds, gardenview and a jacuzzi:) if you go to las vegas, you should defentely stay at this hotel.[SEP]ok, it's expensive but its worth it![SEP]and the location is grest as well, 5 - 10 min from downtown.
1	was very pleasantly surpirsed.[SEP]this was a great place to stay.[SEP]huge room![SEP]the breakfast was good, but not great.[SEP]the location was also good.[SEP]staff very helpful with ideas for eating out
1	this was our first visit to new orleans and this hotel really represented its city well.[SEP]the hotel was so pretty and charming.[SEP]the staff was so hospitable and helpful.[SEP]the location is perfect!![SEP]we had the time of our lives.[SEP]we plan to return to new orleans again and again, and as far as i am concerned the maison st.[SEP]charles inn and suites is the only hotel i will stay with.
1	i had shopped around a lot in looking for a hotel in san francisco and been surprised at the lack of bargains to be had, so due to its low rate was a little wary as i approached hotel diva.[SEP]however, in my opinion the hotel is truly fantastic value (we paid just over $100 inc.[SEP]tax a night for 3 nights).[SEP]firstly, it has a great location, only 5 minutes walk from union square & market street and their good transport links.[SEP]also within a few minutes walk of many restaurants and bars.[SEP]secondly, i had read negative comments about the small rooms but would consider ours quite spacious and well equipped.[SEP]although i did look at a floor plan though and saw there were some much smaller rooms so i think we hit lucky.[SEP]something to bear in mind.[SEP]thirdly, although certainly not fancy or luxurious, the décor is neat and modern with some stylish touches.[SEP]quite basic but all that we required given the minimal time we spent in the room.[SEP]and finally, the extra touches, such as tea and coffee making facilities in the mornings and free internet access were also appreciated and absent from all other hotels on our trip.[SEP]we also had a bag of goodies – yes, free samples supplied by manufacturers but a nice touch nonetheless.
1	this was my second stay at the elan hotel and i will definitely book here again the next time i am in la.[SEP]the location is perfect for any sort of trip.[SEP]the staff is amazing ; very accommodating.[SEP]a special thank you to michael who made our experience at the hotel even better.[SEP]the breakfast in the morning is wonderful with plenty of choice.[SEP]the wine and cheese in the evening is a nice touch.[SEP]the rooms are clean and the room we had was spacious for two.[SEP]my only complaint was hearing the people in the next room but that was probably due to the fact we had an adjoining room (i don't recommend that).
1	it's ironic.[SEP]i stayed here before in may 2008 and after that i wrote on this website that i would not return to the park79.[SEP]however, two years later the vert same park79 is the only hotel i ever stayed in twice.[SEP]budget constraints and my wish to book a room on the upper west side made it unavoidable.[SEP]i must say though, it was better than expected, mostly because i got a better deal on the price.[SEP]the rooms are still small and the wifi is still far from perfect, the elevator is still very slow, but hey: it's new york, the rooms are clean, nice although shared bathroom / shower and there is free coffee in the morning.[SEP]it was very hot in new york (100f / 40c) so i was very glad the airco worked great.[SEP]just like last time i hardly needed the staff, but when i did they were friendly and helpful.[SEP]the location is great if you prefer avoiding midtown.[SEP]a 5 minute walk to the subway on broadway or central park west, cabs everywhere, shops nearby.[SEP]would i come back here?[SEP]probably not, but who knows:)
1	stayed at this hotel for two days while in singapore.[SEP]we paid australian $140 for this dump!!!![SEP]i wish we had paid a little bit extra and stayed at a better hotel.[SEP]the pics of this hotel and rooms are quite deceiving.[SEP]we arrived at the hotel at 6:00pm local time and our room was still not ready.[SEP]we were asked to return in 1 hour.[SEP]we had paid for a deluxe non - smoking room.[SEP]when we finally got to the room i was shocked at how poorly it was maintained.[SEP]my first thoughts when booking this room was " how bad can a three star be in singapore " a country known for it's cleanliness.[SEP]however, golden landmark was worse than most two starts found in north america.[SEP]the room smelled of cigarettes and the odour got worse when you turned the airconditioning on.[SEP]the bed was equivalent to sleeping on a concrete floor, and the pillows were even worse.[SEP]although, the hotel is in a great location it is not worth the stay at golden landmark.[SEP]what i did not know about singapore was the fact that the hotels are cheaper closer to the airport and the train system in singapor is quite efficient and always on time.[SEP]the price to commute from the airport to the city is only $2 singapore dollars.[SEP]therefore, it is better to stay closer to the airport at a better hotel if you can not afford anything in the city.
1	my daughter and i stayed at the hotel d'albe over easter break.[SEP]the hotel lived up to all the fastastic reviews.[SEP]you can't beat the location (right outside of the st.[SEP]michel metro stop).[SEP]we were able to walk to most attractions.[SEP]we were also able to take the rer directly to charles de gaulle with our luggage right from st.[SEP]michel.[SEP]the rooms were extremely clean and the staff was helpful, but not always accurate when giving local information.[SEP]the hotel is located on a busy pedestrian street with musicians and singers right outside.[SEP]we were surprised how quiet our room was when we closed the window.[SEP]great soundproofing![SEP]i would not hestitate to stay here again.
1	based on other ta reviews, we stayed a week at this hotel over spring break while visiting numerous attractions in and around san diego.[SEP]the experience was very positive.[SEP]the hotel is very central to numerous destinations and in a great location off i-5 - we did legoland, wild animal park, belmont park, etc, all a short drive away.[SEP]room (1br suite) was great if a bit crowded for four, breakfast was consistently good, all staff were excellent to work with (i second another guest's comment about norma who ran the breakfast / dinner staff - very friendly and helpful).[SEP]to have dinner included was a real treat, although somewhat restrictive for those who are not carnivores.[SEP]more veggie options would be good.[SEP]overall, in spite of a full facility, we had a great time and would come back here again in a heartbeat.
1	found a great mix of ages whilst we were there.[SEP]was one of the quieter casinos in town.[SEP]the room we had on the 31st floor was spacious and clean.[SEP]our room attendants were very hard working and courteous at all times.[SEP]had the champagne buffet brunch and what great value for money.[SEP]had 2 glasses of champagne and could have had more if we had wanted to.[SEP]the casino was a bit mixed.[SEP]the drink attendants were very unattentive at times and one was especially rude.[SEP]the pool was good although very shaded at times and could be on the cold side.[SEP]pity it did nt open until 0900am.[SEP]would come back to this hotel.[SEP]great hotel for price, location and comfy beds do nt expect the nightlife to be great.[SEP]go elsewhere but nice to come back to a quiet spot after a hectic day / night out.
1	with a quick business trip in nj, was thinking of spending the night in manhattan.[SEP]the grand reopening rates at the hotel lola made me decide yes![SEP]formerly the hotel 30 30, this refurbishment significantly upgraded this property.[SEP]i had a single room, and the website states the rooms are small (approx 125 sq ft), however, plenty spacious for one person.[SEP]room was clean, bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was stocked with all of the required amenities.[SEP]my reservation request of an upper floor was honored, and the front desk staff was friendly and accommodating.[SEP]the rooms have a european feel.[SEP]the location of the hotel lola is close to several subway lines.
1	staying at the stoneleigh was a great experience from start to finish, and i have only very minor complaints.[SEP]the hotel is in a great location and my room was clean and spacious (though i was upgraded from a standard to a deluxe king room when i arrived).[SEP]my only complaints: there's no coffee maker in the room (is this a new trend?[SEP]why?), so if you're a business traveler, that means ordering it via room service or going without coffee before your morning meeting.[SEP]it's annoying, but not fatal.[SEP]also, i ended up ordering breakfast in my room both days (it was pretty good) because i was afraid that the sit - down breakfast service would take too long.[SEP]my only other complaint is that the equipment in the fitness center was pretty inadequate and outdated.[SEP]it certainly wasn't up to the standards of the rest of the hotel.[SEP]overall, this hotel was a great value (i think i paid a $199/night rack rate) for its price class.
1	i picked hotel de la motte picquet for our 6-day stay in paris, based entirely on tripadvisor.com reviews and am so glad i did.[SEP]we loved this hotel![SEP]tina welcomed us on a tuesday morning and got us right into our room on the 3rd floor, a welcome relief for two jet - lagged tourists as this allowed us to take a nap before hitting the streets of paris.[SEP]our room, although smallish, was spotlessly clean and delightfully decorated, and the large bed was very comfortable.[SEP]the doublepane windows blocked out the street noises and we slept very well.[SEP]rue cler is right around the corner and we enjoyed sitting in the outdoor sections of the cafes, having a croissant and a cup of coffee.[SEP]ecole militaire metro stop is one block away, giving easy access to all of paris.[SEP]the eiffel tower, d'orsay museum, invalides, and trocadero are all within easy walking distance.[SEP]but by far the best thing about this hotel is their service.[SEP]i can't say enough about mo and tina.[SEP]they are always available, have suggestions for everything, including transportation, restaurants, sightseeing, etc.[SEP]they are the most outstanding hotel personnel i have ever met.[SEP]their free wireless internet service allowed me to us my itouch to update our trip on facebook for all our friends and family, plus allowed us to keep current with the news.[SEP]i highly recommend this hotel for location, service, and price, but most of all: service, service, service![SEP]stay in paris at hotel de la motte picquet.[SEP]you won't be disappointed.
1	we were traveling to orcas island for a wedding and wanted to stay in seattle for my birthday.[SEP]after much research we decided to book the inn at the market... wow![SEP]the postiive feelings began with an enthusiastic greeting from the bell captain, then the warm reception from the reception desk![SEP]they had upgraded us due to my birthday![SEP](i wanted to show them my license that it really was my birthday!!!) the room was spacious, clean, and had an extrordinary view.[SEP]the bathroom was also large and had wonderful soaps![SEP]when we walked into the room there were four mini cupcakes for my birthday!!!!![SEP]what a special touch![SEP](i do love my birthday!!) we used the roof top deck that afternoon to enjoy a bottle of champagne ; we met several peopel who also were loving the hotel![SEP]it was a glorious afternoon![SEP]we went back that night after dinner to enjoy the view once again![SEP]what can i say... service, view, rooms, location... all superior![SEP]thank you inn at the market for a wonderufl birthday!
1	it was easy to see why this hotel is the top rated one as it has everything you'd want (unless you're incredibly indulgent and need excessive luxury or space).[SEP]the lobby is fine, they have newspapers for the guests, a terrific location right on the ramblas yet the rooms are quiet.[SEP]i'd requested they make dinner reservations and they could not have been more helpful and accommodating as we kept changing nights.[SEP]the room and bathroom was large enough, nicely done and totally comfortable.[SEP]we could not have been happier on all counts and were a few minutes away from the market, where we went each morning for breakfast.[SEP]staff was pleasant.[SEP]everything is well maintained and spotless.
1	the hotel has excellent location- close to train station (only few stops by tram or 10 min by taxi), close to all museums and all attractions you should visit in amsterdam.[SEP]if you like walking everything is within walking distance.[SEP]the museums and art galleries are app 40 min walk (or 10 min tram if you do nt want to walk that far), heineken museum is just around the corner, anne's frank museum is 15 min by walk- honestly i could nt imagine better location.[SEP]the hotel itself is lovely- its off the main roads so its nice and quiet (we had really good sleep, not disturbed by any noise) and the rooms are simply charming.[SEP]after stays in hotels that look the same, regardless where you are, its such a nice change as the room was lovely with more of personal touch.[SEP]it was nt very spacious, but its amsterdam, you would nt expect lots of space, and the design of the room made up for lack of space.[SEP]we had breakfast only one morning, and although its a bit pricey as other reviews mention, we were absolutely spoiled with choice.[SEP]the selection was very impressive, much better in other mercures.[SEP]all members of staff vere excellent, very helpful and always there for you.[SEP]there is simply nothing bad i could say about this hotel and our stay, everything was lovely, some things eg location, better than expected.[SEP]definately will book this hotel for next trip to amsterdam:)
1	we stayed 6 nights at the point orlando resort in a 1 bedroom executive suite.[SEP]location is very close to international drive but far enough away not to be bothered with traffic.[SEP]given the time of our stay and the pool not being utilised, i do think it could be noisy during peake times.[SEP]parking at the resort is free.[SEP]the suite itself was comfortable with small balcony overlooking the pool.[SEP]1 bathroom with bath and seperate shower.[SEP]a king sized bed in the bedroom, sofabed in the lounge and small kitchen which included a washer and dryer.[SEP]the reasonable resort fee included free wireless internet access, bed making and changes of towels.[SEP]i did wonder what it was going to take for them to change the tea towel though.[SEP]i booked this accomodation through the hotel itself and as i had signed up to receive their e - mails, got a free breakfast offer in the form of vouchers for two people for the length of our stay.[SEP]even thouugh we did not use all the vouchers, i found this stay to be exceptional value.[SEP]check -in was ok but not outstanding.[SEP]check - out was the same.
1	stayed here 19/3 - 22/3.[SEP]location, location, location!!![SEP]perfect for short trip with not to much time to spend in room.[SEP]as said many times before rooms not huge, but bathroom very impressive.[SEP](shower only).[SEP]only real gripe no tea / coffee making facilities.[SEP]staff friendly, housekeeping very impressive.[SEP]would definately go and eat on 9th ave between 51st and 54th street, especially the road with the chinese on 1 corner, lunch special $6 and the grill on the opposite corner(best value breakfasts).
1	union square is a really nice and convenient area, and this hotel is perfectly situated in the middle.[SEP]a few blocks from the powell st.[SEP]bart station and blocks from chinatown, this is a great hotel in an amazing location.[SEP]the king - size bed was just divine, and the shower was so good.[SEP]i'd definitely stay here again if i find myself in san fran in the future.
1	i was able to get a room for six nights with two double beds with my rewards points for our family trip.[SEP]we found the location to be great.[SEP]we have stayed at holiday inn express hotels in quite a few states so we were used to the wonderful breakfast that they serve.[SEP]at this hotel the space is a bit small but we never had trouble getting a table.[SEP]our room was very clean.[SEP]the people at the front desk went out of there way to be helpful as did the gentleman at the concerige desk.[SEP]the only thing i would probably do different if i was to go back is get two rooms.[SEP]i had been warned by many friends that the rooms in new york were a good bit smaller than what we were accustomed to.[SEP]it was true![SEP]however a family of four managed to make it for six days with a little organization.[SEP]a helpful tip i have used for travel would be to take a clear over the door shoe holder for the bathroom for your tolietries, curling irons and such.[SEP]it helps with the clutter and gives you a little more counter space.
1	location a bit further from the centre of attractions, but only 2mins walk to nearest metro station that will take you directly to plaza de catalunya in abt 10mins.[SEP]the hotel is modern and one of the best feature is the rooftop pool and patio, which affords a gorgeous view of the agbar tower and the sea.[SEP]the rooms are well equipped and modern.[SEP]staff are very helpful and friendly.[SEP]and they've got colourful furniture in the lobby area... in line with the vibrancy of barcelona
1	location excellent.[SEP]hotel is badly in need of renovation.[SEP]room small and cramped.[SEP]bathroom emitted an odor.[SEP]no amenties.[SEP]hair drier gave out cool air only.[SEP]reception personnel not very helpful.[SEP]breakfast expensive.[SEP]many shops nearby where you could pick up an inexpensive meal.
1	i have really mixed feelings about this hotel in barcelona.[SEP]we stayed here for 6 nights in late june 2011.[SEP]the location of the hotel is close to two metro lines, near many good restaurants and shopping but in a quiet neighborhood.[SEP]or it should have been quiet, but/ for the street construction that meant less traffic noise but more construction noise and much more sidewalk debris.[SEP]the hotel's lobby was comfortable but catered to the bar crowd rather than the hotel patrons.[SEP]we got the same feeling at the rooftop bar - if you aren't young and hip, you did not belong.[SEP]we did get excellent service and restaurant recommendations from the front desk - which was really unusual for this trip in spain.[SEP]this hotel's front desk staff has the right idea about service and attitude.[SEP]our room was adequate in size (a corner room) and clean.[SEP]the bathroom was also roomy, clean and modern.[SEP]the rooms could use some sound - proofing ; it seemed like we could hear every noise in the halls.[SEP]all in all, i would stay here again because the price was right, i could sleep despite the noise, and i felt like i received good service.
1	i can't say enough about the location of the hotel.[SEP]right near washington square park, great restaurants / bars & shopping.[SEP]what more could you ask for?[SEP]it has a neighborhood feel instead of a touristy feel which i enjoy.[SEP]otto (one of mario batali's restaurants) is right around the corner.[SEP]it's not only delicious but very reasonably priced.[SEP]bars like the four faced liar & slaughtered lamb on 6th & fat black p****cat on 3rd are all great neighborhood bars.[SEP]shopping is only a handful of blocks away on broadway![SEP]the hotel is clean with decent size rooms & bathrooms.[SEP]i have nothing negative to say about this hotel.[SEP]i loved it and will definitely return.
1	if you want location and service stay at this hotel.[SEP]my husband and i just spent a week in boston and stayed 7 wonderful nights at the lenox hotel.[SEP]first the service is wonderful.[SEP]from the moment we arrived we were greeted warmly and felt they were happy we came.[SEP]every employee we encountered from the doormen to the maids was helpful and friendly and this lasted a whole week.[SEP]the concierge helped with our of our needs -- trolley tickets, tour information, red sox tickets, restaurant reservations, in a friendly way.[SEP]he also gave great advice about buying city passes which saved us a lot of money.[SEP]our room was wonderful, large and comfortable -- but it was a corner executive room -- which i highly recommend.[SEP]the location of this hotel is superb.[SEP]boston is a walking city and we were able to walk to boston common, the freedom trail, fenway park, the museum of fine arts, the convention center, the prudential center and copley square.[SEP]having never been to boston before, i took tripadvisor's recommendation that this was the no.[SEP]1 hotel in boston.[SEP]i absolutely agree with that.[SEP]we would stay here again in a heartbeat and i highly recommend this hotel to anyone.[SEP]location, service, amenities -- it has it all.
1	i stayed at this hotel in april 2011 during the easter break.[SEP]it was also my 35th birthday which my husband and i wanted to celebrate in rome.[SEP]the location is very good ; close to many major attractions.[SEP]however, it operates more as a business type hotel rather than a luxury one.[SEP]it is big, the staff is not very attentive (not rude but just don't pay much attention to guests - something i often see in big hotels while on business trips).[SEP]we asked for a little nicer room (within the same price category) given my birthday but were given a room with the view to the internal yard which was not nice at all.[SEP]also, the room was quite small.[SEP]their swimming pool is good and there were hardly any people there but, for some reason, during 2 out of 3 of our visits to the poole there were some construction people trying to fix something there which didn't make us wanting to use the poole for longer than 10 minutes (probably that is why the poole was constantly empty!).[SEP]so all in all i would not recommend this hotel for any special occasion, particularly in busy seasons like easter etc.
1	don't hesitate to stay here - it's a lovely hotel, well deserving of its trip advisor awards.[SEP]we stayed in 501 - 2 huge rooms, (i massive double bed, 2 double sofa beds) 2 bathrooms, kitchen and dining area.[SEP]beautifully decorated and quiet location ; pretty views of canal.[SEP]very helpful front desk staff, helped with great restaurant recommendations and airport travel logistics.[SEP]ample breakfasts, plenty of variety, served in room (no restaurant in the hotel).[SEP]central - short walk from st marks.[SEP]free 15 mins internet use via lobby pc - useful for flight check - in etc.[SEP]our teenager complained that the sofa bed matress was a bit hard![SEP]great shopping nearby (above armani) and numerous reastaurants in the vicinity.
1	i am not very demanding of my lodging, but in my opinion this is not a 3.5 star hotel.[SEP]we had no bath mat, 1 set of towels each, poor amenities, and the sheets on the bed were so short that they didn't even cover the mattress, which is just plain gross.[SEP]fortunately the other bed had longer sheets.[SEP]unfortunately, that raises other questions.[SEP]we also didn't have the extra blanket that was supposed to be in the room.[SEP]there were 2 beds, but only one table between them, with the lighting all on it, fortunately i carry a headlamp so i could still read in bed.[SEP]really, it was not a good hotel, i would not pay much.[SEP]the location was good, blue dog cafe around the corner for bfst and lunch take away was great.[SEP]i do not usually make reviews, but i just had to say something about this place.
1	great central location - we could walk everywhere we needed to go.[SEP]the rooms we were given (3 single travellers) were dreadful.[SEP]they stank of smoke and one was uninhabitable due to being above the kitchen and the smell of food was overpowering.[SEP]the rooms themselves were like something time forgot.[SEP]i seem to remember sticking to the carpet.[SEP]extremely depressing.[SEP]we asked to be changed and the staff could not have been more helpful.[SEP]admittedly we would have liked to have moved that day but they told us to pack out bags in the morning and they would move everything for us.[SEP]they obviously get asked this a lot as they didn't question it.[SEP]they did move us the next day into the refurbished rooms and they were fine.[SEP]not outstanding but not bad at all.[SEP]breakfast was poor by business hotel standards but quite edible.[SEP]would stay there again if the price was right and i could guarantee a refurbished room.
1	booked this trip through " hotwire " which i never had done before.[SEP]once i got my confirmation i emailed the hotel ref room info.[SEP]tom quickly replied stating he was able to place us on an upper floor and upgrade our room.[SEP]upon check - in very nice and accommodating front desk personnel met us.[SEP]when we arrived at our room it was everything tom had said.[SEP]nice size, clean and comfortable.[SEP]bathroom was an â€œokâ€ � size, functional.[SEP]hotel itself was very clean.[SEP]great location easy in and out ; would definitely sty here on our next trip.[SEP]thanks to the entire staff for a great trip.
1	my friends and i stayed at st.[SEP]marks hotel during the last weekend in august and encountered no problems at all with the hotel.[SEP]the location was excellent as it was very close to the subway station (astor place) about a 2mins walk and is a short subway ride from all you need to see in the city.[SEP]the hotel is also within walking distance to soho, china town, canal st, etc... our room had 2 double beds, air conditioning that worked well and wasn't loud as others have said and also had a flat panel tv with a bunch of channels.[SEP]washroom was clean and tidy although it was quite small.[SEP]i would recommend this hotel for students or young singles as the area has a vibrant nightlife and is located close to nyu.[SEP]overall this hotel exceeded our expectation for the price we paid ($170/night) when compared to other accommodations in one of the most expensive cities in the world.[SEP]the staff was very helpful and friendly and assisted you with any needs you might have.[SEP]i would definitely go back again and will recommend this hotel to people visiting nyc.
1	i was concerned when booking this hotel due to the negative reviews on noise and club - like feel.[SEP]i must say i enjoyed staying at the hotel.[SEP]the location can't be beaten: in the meat packing district and close to chelsea and the village.[SEP]yes, it's a bit noisy with all the hooting and sirens but this is nyc after all.[SEP]the double glazing does a good job at keeping most noise out.[SEP]there are clubbers outside the hotel on fri / sat but it didn't bother me.[SEP]althought it would be nice if there was a dedicated door and lift for hotel guests.[SEP]the rooms were large by ny standards and fast free wi - fi provided which is a big plus in my books.[SEP]i had dinner at the japanses restaurant downstairs and the food was delicious, highly recommended.[SEP]i expected more from the breakfast though as the hotel is pretty expensive.
1	we stayed in the annex to the main hotel.[SEP]now mind you this is a 3 star annex to a 4 star hotel, so it was very nice.[SEP]the room was a nice size with beautiful furnishings, but a little dark due to its location in the building and the low level room lighting.[SEP]the bathroom had a full tub with a hand - held shower spray.[SEP]the bidet was a little in the way (why do people still use those things?), but the bathroom was a workable size.[SEP]breakfast consisted of cereals, breads, yogurt, meats, fruit, and coffee and tea to order.[SEP]the hotel is about a 2 minute walk to st.[SEP]mark's square, and about 10 minutes to the realto bridge.[SEP]the hotel website accurately says you can see the bridge of sighs, but the bridge is currently being renovated so it's covered.[SEP]upon checkin they offered us the chance to join a group gondola tour at roughly 1/2 price (we passed) and a free trip to the glass museum on murano (which we did).[SEP]the water taxi picked us up right at the hotel, which has it's own " dock ".[SEP]the staff was what you'd expect at a 4 star hotel - a little stuffy, but very nice - and they spoke english quite well.[SEP]we ordered tea one afternoon, and it was 9 euros.[SEP]quite pricey.[SEP]overall, a very nice hotel in a great location in the most beautiful city in the world.
1	i was a little apprehensive having read many of the reviews about the hudson hotel but could not fault the hudson.[SEP]yes the rooms are small and the bathroom even smaller, but the room was clean and after all i was only there to sleep so personally the size of the room was not an issue.[SEP]great location for shopping, central park etc.[SEP]staff very helpful, and great breakfast at route 66' just a few blocks away.[SEP]good price compared to other hotels near by.[SEP]i hope to return again in the future.
1	the staff is extremely friendly ; we never entered the hotel without being greeted with a smile & a pleasant hello.[SEP]the location is excellent.[SEP]we only moved our car once while we were in town.[SEP]we were able to walk to the riverfront, the french market & even the wwii museum.[SEP](we also walked to mardi gras world, but that one was a bit of a haul!) only criticisms i have are minor: there was a rubber piece at the bottom of our air conditioning unit that was hanging down & didn't look that appealing, our door was very loose in its jamb & let a lot of light in at night (although it did lock securely), it would be nice if there was more than one trashcan in the room (king deluxe, which is kind of a mini - suite), & for the price we paid per night, i think breakfast should have been included.[SEP]the bright side of that is that we ate at cafe du monde two mornings, & i bought a box of pop tarts at the walgreens on the corner for the rest!
1	we arrived at the hotel and were allocated the vip suite (room 501) at no extra cost![SEP]the hotel staff were unbelievable, so friendly and helpful, they just could nt do enough for us.[SEP]the bell boy took our bags up to the room and showed us the safety deposit box and free mini bar.[SEP]the staff on reception helped with directions, sight seeing advice and restaurant reccommendations.[SEP]the room itself was immaculate and very spacious.[SEP]the breakfast room was very pleasant and the offering was good - cereal, fruit, yoghurts, bread and croissants, ham / cheeses, scrambled eggs, bacon, toast and preserves etc the location of the hotel was perfect - a two minute walk from piazza di republicca and via nazionale, where there are many bars and small cafes / restaurants.[SEP]the trevi fountain, spanish steps and colloseum are all within half hour walking distance (or 5 mins on the metro).[SEP]we would reccomend trattoria berzitello on via delle quattro fontane off via nazionale to eat.[SEP]it is a small traditional italian eaterie and the vast menu and extensive wine list is very reasonably priced.
1	i didn't stay at this hotel for free using points unlike a lot of the reviewers here and bear in mind that this place isn't cheap.[SEP]480 euro a night without taxes or other charges for me.[SEP]i don't know where the average price on tripadvisor comes from.[SEP]having said that, the room was nicely appointed but the bathroom was a bit on the small side.[SEP]the hotel is in a fantastic location and as you expect from most hilton hotels around the world, very well maintained.[SEP]the massage was excellent and the food at the ground floor restaurant was pretty good (the only place where everything felt inexpensive).[SEP]but it was the courteous staff who really made this place shine and i look forward to seeing them again in a couple of months..
1	i spent with my family in swissotel the stamford 4 nights in august.[SEP]we were upgraded to harbour view room due to early booking.[SEP]the view from 44.[SEP]floor - amazing![SEP]skyscrapers (this hotel is not situated about 500 m from the cbd, so you can see them all from perspective), harbour, bay etc.[SEP]the staff very friendly and helpful.[SEP]breakfast - one of the best i have ever met - wide choice of everything from cereals through cheeses and meat to fruits.[SEP]hot and cold, delicious.[SEP]location of the hotel - also great, just above the metro station with direct access (what's good in singapore's climate).[SEP]just a few walking minutes from the rafles, theatre, cbd and the merlion.[SEP]i fully recommend!
1	i stayed at the tropicana years ago - in the 80's.[SEP]it has changed in a good way.[SEP]vegas hotels have become too over the top with everyone trying to keep up with the jones.[SEP]if you want a very reasonable hotel with a touch of old vegas, this is the place for you.[SEP]the good things - location.[SEP]closest to airport.[SEP]price.[SEP]hotel upgrade.[SEP]good location on the strip.[SEP]the staff bends over backwards for you and really cares.[SEP]i like businesses that appreciate their customers and try to make you happy.[SEP]give it a try!
1	we had some friends that were staying nearby, so we booked this hotel.[SEP]we did get an ocean room with a balcony, which was nice.[SEP]the room was just average, but it was clean.[SEP]the pool area looked nice as well.[SEP]the location is everything here - you can walk straight out to the beach and to a lot of restaurants, bars, etc., in the area.[SEP]they do charge separately for parking and there isn't a breakfast.[SEP]i think this is the first best western i have stayed at that didn't include breakfast!
1	my husband and 6 yo daughter and i stayed at the starhotel metropole rome for 9 nights in july - august 09.[SEP]we got an excellent rate booking online through the hotel site, and were fantastically pleased with everything about this hotel.[SEP]the location was perfect - a 5 minute walk from roma termini station so the train to and from the airport was the best option.[SEP]similarly, most tour buses and local buses leave from here, so a perfect hotel to base yourself.[SEP]termini station also has a zillion shops, and a very cheap supermarket so you can get your necessities.[SEP]if you are staying in rome for a while, this hotel is also a great choice with an ondablu laundromat just a 5 minute walk up the street (viaprincipe amedeo).[SEP]the room was great, the hotel is in a quiet street, the staff were lovely and the free buffet breakfast was delicious.[SEP]many restaurants within a short walk juo.[SEP]and a little shop selling gelato just a few doors down.[SEP](good when you are travelling will little ones).[SEP]if we are ever back in rome, we will definitely stay here again.[SEP]thanks to all the staff for an excellent stay.[SEP]cheers from australia.
1	i was on a bit of an adventure when i booked a spontaneous trip to ca for the weekend to catch some live music.[SEP]this was my first trip to san diego (and my first trip to ca since i was 6 yrs old!).[SEP]a friend of mine recommended the ocean park inn to me, and i am so glad she did.[SEP]from the time i called to book my reservation until the time i left the hotel (24 hrs after arrival), i felt comfortable and happy with my decision to stay there.[SEP]the front desk staff were incredibly friendly and helpful.[SEP]the location of the hotel could not have been any more convenient to the beach and local shopping areas.[SEP]there is even a grocery store a block away.[SEP]i felt like i was right at home (if only my home were right next to the beach!).[SEP]the pb shore club (right next door) has the most amazing fish tacos i have ever had, and there were super cool and friendly people hanging out there.[SEP]in less than 30 minutes, you can walk up the boardwalk to mission beach / la jolla.[SEP]hopefully the weather will be a bit more conducive to some " fun in the sun " next time i go.[SEP]i am definitely going back!!![SEP]oh, the complimentary breakfast rocked too.... belgian waffles![SEP]yum![SEP]thanks for making this texan feel so comfortable and welcomed.[SEP]it meant a lot to me!
1	this hotel is great value for money and the location is perfect.[SEP]located in an upmarket area of rome with restaurants and shops within 100 meters.[SEP]also 10 minute walk from spanish steps and 15 minute walk from trevi fountain.[SEP]in fact all major attractions are walkable.[SEP]bus stops and taxi rank also witnin 100 meters.[SEP]the sun terrace on the 6th floor provides panoramic views over the city where you can relax with a drink and have dinner.[SEP]breakfast is good quality (especially the coffee) only down side is that breakfast is not served on the roof terrace but in the basement.
1	we stayed in october for 12 nights in a 1 bed suite and enjoyed every minute.[SEP]the location is excellent at the south end of international drive bit no more than 30 minutes from anywhere including orlando international airport.[SEP]i agree with all the previous comments and would add that everything is spotlessly clean and well organised.[SEP]the small pool is quiet and easy for access.[SEP]my only warnings would be the price of a glass of wine in a plastic cup at $9 without tax and tip![SEP]also the big pool can be very noisy in the evening but becomes silent at about 10 pm.[SEP]outback steakhouse in a 10 minute walk and publix is very convenient at 5 minutes.[SEP]i had no problem with wireless and the outlet mall next door always has fast food available.[SEP]we stayed in building 6 which is need the bridge and the secure gate to the mall.[SEP]we would stay here again without any worries.
1	our trip to seattle was magical for the christmas spirit.[SEP]the hotel is intimate and super clean.[SEP]the staff were very helpful and attentive (what we've come to expect from kimpton).[SEP]the lobby is very small for the evening wine tasting but certainly gives you the opportunity to meet other travellers.[SEP]the room was luxurious and very comfortable.[SEP]the beds were a treat![SEP]the location is in walking distance to all the downtown stores, pike's market and benroya hall.[SEP]it is far enough away to offer quiet though.[SEP]the cost was a little on the pricey side for the stay however.[SEP]seattle is a great city to visit and the people are very friendly.
1	what a beautiful westin![SEP]this westin is modern, clean and in a perfect location.[SEP]we stayed there for one night in mid december and wished we could have stayed longer.[SEP]we had 2 rooms.[SEP]one for my mother - in - law and one for us.[SEP]we were there to celebrate our son ’s 5th birthday.[SEP]he mentioned that he was almost 5 to one of the staff and happened to mention that he likes building lego and when we returned back from dinner there was a gift bag in our suite for him with a new lego in it.[SEP]the lobby is really nice to relax and enjoy a nice glass of wine.[SEP]we walked to the newer oxbow marketplace for dinner.[SEP]later that evening grandma offered to babysit and my husband and i went out on the town.[SEP]we were able to walk to some really great spots for some food, drink and fun in the older downtown napa.[SEP]downtown napa is really nice![SEP]i have to put a good word in for downtown joe's and their clam chowder![SEP]good bar atmosphere and great clam chowder.[SEP]in the morning, we went for a lovely swim in the hotel pool and hot tub, which are both outside and very clean and nice and warm on a rainy day.[SEP]we often go on adventures and stay at many nice hotels and this one ranks at the very top of my favorites list![SEP]i think we will be back very soon.
1	great location, good service and good sized room.[SEP]everything in good working order.[SEP]staff could not be more friendly.[SEP]breakfast choice excellent.[SEP]but please venice get your act together.[SEP]we want tea making facilities in our rooms.[SEP]if you want an international clientel then cater for them.[SEP]an half board option would also go down well.[SEP]you should not have to drag a kettle half way round the world in this day and age.
1	my usual paris hotel was fully booked and a friend recommended la fouquet's.[SEP]i must say that i was glad that my usual hotel was full, as we had a superb experience at la fouquet's.[SEP]the staff and hotel manager nicely greeted us and showed us to our room.[SEP]the quality of the rooms, furniture and amenities far exceeded our expectations.[SEP]the hotels is seconds away from the champs and boutiques.[SEP]an amazing location.[SEP]i will definitely be visiting this hotel again in the future.
1	this little hotel is a gem.[SEP]its location is fantastic for all of paris and the bits tourists want to see.[SEP]arrive in the evening at metro stop varenne and see the eiffel tower sparkle.[SEP]walk around the corner, past the rodin museum and you are there.[SEP]great little bistro just up the road as well.[SEP]visit the local flower and speciality shops in the morning.[SEP]the hotel staff are really friendly and speak 100% perfect english.[SEP]good quality rooms with tv / sat / dvd, piping hot water, nice and quiet.[SEP]immaculately clean and just undergoing an outside repaint to spruce up ready for the summer season.[SEP]the little courtyard is a great place for breakfast, and they are not mean with the croissants and coffee:-) but don't tell everyone, as it is too good a secret to share!
1	terrific midtown location.[SEP]we stayed 3 nights and had a great time.[SEP]the hotel is a block from grand central, and an easy walk to the theater district, times square, the shops on 5th avenue and rockefeller center.[SEP]lots of restaurants nearby.[SEP]the room was small but nice.[SEP]staff was friendly and helpful.[SEP]very impressive old time lobby with lots going on all the time.
1	enjoyed our stay here very much.[SEP]the postion of this complex is wonderful.[SEP]it is close to all the attractions but its position is at the quiet end of international drive so the traffic is not heavy.[SEP]the grounds and surroundings are lovely although the apartment itself could do with being updated.[SEP]we stayed in the one bedroom apartment and although the bed in the main bedroom was very comfortable the mattress on the bed settee could have been better.[SEP]the service at the marriott was excellent - there was a problem with our cistern and maintenance arrived only 15 minutes after i had contacted the desk - i was very impressed![SEP]if going to orlando again i would probably consider staying here again, based mainly on its excellent location and excellent facilities within the grounds.
1	i was nearly put off staying at this hotel, after reading some of the reviews.[SEP]but i'm glad i gave it a go.[SEP]the rooms are on the small side, but you would find the same in any big city.[SEP]the room was clean, modern and functional and the bed was very comfy.[SEP]the bathroom on the other hand was small, but very clean, although it was everything you needed.[SEP]for an 80 singapore dollars per room per night, you get access to the traders club lounge.[SEP]this give you and your partner buffet breakfast, unlimited cocktails / alcoholic drinks and nibbles in the evening, hot beverages / soft drinks throughout the day, late checkout at 6 pm, and unlimited internet access.[SEP]the hotel is in a great location for the orchard road area, which is about 5 minutes walk.[SEP]the underground is about 10 minutes walk if you don't get stuck in a crowd of people.[SEP]the bus stop for the hop on - hop off bus is just across the road.
1	a friend of mine and i stayed here from 28.07.[SEP]- 01.08.2011.[SEP]the location is excellent, and service is outstanding.[SEP]location in middle of town, very close to chinatown.[SEP]highly recommended!
1	this was our second stay at the columbus motor inn.[SEP]it is in a good location, just a block from the more expensive fisherman's wharf hotels.[SEP]we walked to the coit tower, chinatown, fisherman's wharf (5 min.) and even back from union square one nice day.[SEP]the rooms are nicely furnished, including a table and flat screen tv, and the bathrooms are large and clean.[SEP]staff is friendly and helpful, parking is included in the room rate.[SEP]breakfast is not included, but the front desk recommended pat's cafe around the corner and it was great.
1	traveled with a group of friends and booked the quad room which was very spacey.[SEP]the location couldn't of been better.[SEP]spent hours exploring the city on foot and this was the perfect spot to stay right near trevi!![SEP]the manager was very helpful and nice.[SEP]definitely way better than the hotel near the train station that i stayed at on my first trip to rome.[SEP]would absolutely stay here again!
1	my girlfriend and i stayed in this great hotel / resort while we were touring the us.[SEP]the location, the middle of bel air, was very nice although you could only get around by car or taxi.[SEP]the overall feel of the hotel is definitely 5 star, without being overly pretentious or snobbish.[SEP]the moment we arrived in our room complementary wine, fruit and tea arrived.[SEP]the gym was fine and quite private, the food and wine was great, the dark bar featured an excellent piano player who took all kinds of requests.[SEP]the service was impeccable, any problems (our tv stopped working) were fixed very quickly.[SEP]just before leaving we found out that the wireless internet connection was complementary as well, a surprise as it didnâ€ ™ t seem to work for us the first few days.
1	i stayed here for a week for a conference that was being held at the westin.[SEP]i have no complaints ; the view was very nice, room was spacious, good maid service, comfortable bed, and very clean.[SEP]i did not have a problem with the staff but then again i did not really need anything from them.[SEP]the hotel is in a central location, too.[SEP]i would recommend it for sightseeing as it's right on market street and super close to lots of food and shopping.[SEP]about a 20 minute straight shot walk takes you to the embarcadero.
1	we booked a family suite.[SEP]it had 2 connecting rooms and 2 bathrooms.[SEP]it was much more space than we needed but very welcome when you have 2 little kids.[SEP]the hotel was clean and functional.[SEP]not luxurious but we did not expect that at the price we paid.[SEP]the location is fantastic.[SEP]quiet street but very close to arc de triomphe.[SEP]the staff was friendly and spoke english.[SEP]we had no view and some construction noise from the top floors in the morning but it was not really intrusive.[SEP]overall we had a very positive experience.
1	we stayed here for 21 nights.[SEP]we were mean't to be in the comfort suites opposite but due to rebooking cos of the volcano we were placed here.[SEP]it was by no means perfect but there as very little bad to say about it.[SEP]our midnight checkin was easy, the rooms fine for what we needed (bathroom a bit small), cleaned every day with new towels, comfy bed, pool adequate, location good.[SEP]next to mcdonalds which is handy for brekkie and opposite old town which is great to walk over to.[SEP]we would stay again.
1	we stayed here last new years eve.[SEP]we found the hotel to be wonderful ; a rare find in that this is a historic hotel that has not had the charm remodeled out of it.[SEP]the location is great, downtown in the middle of much of phoenix's best night spots.[SEP]the area was a good place to be for new years eve (for phoenix).[SEP]hanny's is a lovely bar/ restaurant in walking distance to the hotel... it's a renovated mid - century department store.[SEP]this would be a convenient hotel for a downtown pub crawl as well.[SEP]the rooms are indeed small, and the bathrooms are tiny, with period fixtures.[SEP]i found these facts charming ; if you want a giant bathroom counter, this isn't your hotel.[SEP]we found the restaurant downstairs to be inadequately equipped for the huge crowd that showed up wanting breakfast new years day.... but that is probably just due to the holiday.[SEP]we had to walk to breakfast elsewhere.[SEP]this place was also loud at night... but it was new years, so that is understandable.[SEP]we would absolutely go back if we have the chance.[SEP]this was a rather glamorous spot to spend new years, a very " old hollywood " feeling.[SEP]recommended!
1	this hotel was nothing short of luxury![SEP]all of the staff was extremely helpful, the spa was amazing, the pool as gorgeous and it has an incredible location.[SEP]easy to walk to other hotels on the strip although there is plenty to do and see here, i don't know why anyone would want to leave![SEP]rooms were very spacious and the soaking tub is the perfect way to end a vegas night.[SEP]i'd highly recommend this hotel.
1	we loved the waldorf.[SEP]this was a girls getaway to nyc for some shows, dinner and just relaxation.[SEP]we enjoyed ourselves so much.[SEP]the location was good but not the best but the atmosphere is wonderful, the service outstanding, the beds divine.[SEP]would we stay there again??[SEP]maybe not.[SEP]although we enjoyed it very much we went with a budget and it's difficult to enjoy all of the waldorf on a budget, but we didn't expect anything different, we were at the waldorf.
1	the hotel is perfectly located in the center of the city.[SEP]rooms are clean and have been reformed recently.[SEP]even though it's central location, at night it was quite in our room (with terrace and access to the rooftop pool).[SEP]friendly and helpful staff.[SEP]wireless connection is very good and it's free.[SEP]spacious shower (overhead).[SEP]we had no meals in the hotel.[SEP]from the rooftop pool you have a glimpse at the catedral.
1	my boyfriend and i loved this hotel.[SEP]it's extremely clean and comfortable, in a wonderful location close to the metro.[SEP]the staff were helpful and gracious and spoke fairly good english.[SEP]though not big, our room was a decent size for paris.[SEP]everything was well maintained & worked.[SEP]lots of electrical outlets.[SEP]comfortable mattress.[SEP]quiet, no noise from street or other rooms.[SEP]good free wifi, and 2 pc's in the lobby.[SEP]breakfast was basic, but fine.[SEP]our whole stay (8 nights) was a pleasure, and for the price, this was much nicer than many other places i've stayed in paris.[SEP]to quote my boyfriend " i'd go back to that hotel 100 times again " - and we plan to!
1	i stayed here for 5 nights in november 2006 and couldn't fault the hotel.[SEP]staff were friendly and helpful and the room and spacious, nicely decorated, quiet and very clean.[SEP]we didn't eat here but i did order room service which was delicious and beautifully served.[SEP]there is also a good hotel bar.[SEP]the location was perfect for us.[SEP]i'd recommend this hotel to anyone looking for somewhere central to stay in manhattan as i was absolutely delighted with it.
1	- very good location, 5 min walk from paddington station and everyone around the area helped us with directions to hotel.[SEP]- rooms very basic, we did nt have a window but litrally only used the hotel to sleep so was not bothered.[SEP]they were clean though and that's all that really mattered![SEP]tv did nt work but probably could have been sorted out with reception but we did nt bother asking as it did not matter.[SEP]- reception were helpful, we were able to leave our bags behind there all day which was very good.[SEP]- small bar, did nt use but looked average.[SEP]pubs across the road and shops nearby.[SEP]- overall a very good stay for a very cheap price.[SEP]only bad thing was that people turned up at the hotel early hours of the morning and woke us up.[SEP]we are only 18 so i can see where they are coming from but the walls in the hotel are really thin so it wasn't good.[SEP]they also set off the fire alarm twice which was very annoying.[SEP]it just depends what type of people are in the hotel when you stay i suppose.
1	the location is very good.[SEP]a few steps from old montreal and modern montreal.[SEP]the rooms were comfortable and exceed our expectations.[SEP]good breakfast and manager reception.[SEP]very clean.
1	the property is nice and our rooms were spacious and clean.[SEP]we used the kitchen and the washer / dryer really came in handy.[SEP]we also had a lovely view of the golf course.[SEP]what i did not like about this property is the location of our rooms to all the pools and exercise room.[SEP]our building was at the very end.[SEP]the property is pretty spread out and you have to walk quite a ways to get to the pools.[SEP]we shortened our stay because of this and decided to go to jw marriotts for a much lower price and included breakfast too.[SEP]overall, the property and service is not bad.[SEP]our stay would have been perfect if we were closer to the pools and exercise room.
1	the room wasn't that bad.[SEP]if you go, don't expect a flat screen, heavenly beds, or glass shower doors.[SEP]this would basically be a last resort type of place for the price.[SEP]the view is amazing from the balcony, the beds are just good enough to sleep in, and the kitchenette plays it role for any cooking you may want to do.[SEP]the carpet is indeed a bit outdated and either needs to be replaced or deep cleaned.[SEP]the door locks (thank goodness) although it isn't the most safe looking and the air conditioning works.[SEP]when you see the building online it looks magnificent in the light but it's really not lol.[SEP]paint is chipped and the hallway may or may not smell funny.[SEP]in conclusion: great place to stay at a great location for the somewhat decent price.[SEP]just know what you re getting yourself into:)
1	we stayed here when we came to see the musical " mary poppins " at the paramount theatre.[SEP]the location was very convenient - only a couple blocks away and several restaurants to choose from located between the hotel and theatre.[SEP]we spent such little time in our hotel room or the hotel - i can't even comment on the tv or other amenities of the hotel.[SEP]hotel and hotel room was clean.[SEP]the beds were comfortable.[SEP]the price for parking was steep - but i understand that is the going rate for seattle downtown hotels.[SEP]when we returned to our hotel room at 11:30 to go to bed - one of the rooms was quite loud and keeping us up.[SEP]i phoned the front desk and they promptly took care of it.[SEP]as i could here the staff talking to the guests i must add they handled it in a most professional manner.[SEP]check - in for us was smooth and quick.[SEP]but i did notice a line had formed behind me when i was done checkin in and there was only 1 staff member doing " regular " check - ins - so those guest may have had to wait.[SEP]no wait at check - out as i had no reason to visit the front desk at check out.
1	i've been going to nyc for over 20 years every thanksgiving and stayed in a lot of hotels... this is by far the best hotel i've stayed in.[SEP]the value for the money was outstanding.[SEP]to start with, the front desk staff was so helpful - especially one of the front desk staff named willie - he always had a smile and hello for us coming or going.[SEP]the breakfast was excellent and a great way to start the day - muffins, pastries, cereals, fruit, hard boiled eggs, fresh made waffles, juices, coffee, and more.[SEP]breakfast room was a little small, but you could take food back to rooms.[SEP]the rooms had the most modern and up - to - date decor i have seen in nyc, even the bathrooms were modern.[SEP]location was great - very close to times square.[SEP]i'm telling you - you will not find better hotel for the money in nyc.[SEP]yes - rooms are small, but in nyc all hotel rooms are small.[SEP]i've already booked this hotel for next thanksgiving.
1	we stayed at this hotel from april 10 to april 21 and i could not have been happier with our choice.[SEP]we got caught up iin the ash cloud chaos and the hotel let us stay for a few extra nights.[SEP]we though we would be charged alot more but they gave us a special rate.[SEP]the staff there is amazing!![SEP]they are so helpful.[SEP]if you need any advice where to go or directions alway ask at the front desk.[SEP]our room was always clean and surprisingly spacious for a paris hotel.[SEP]the location couldn't have been better, you are close to everything.[SEP]they provided breakfast and it was great.[SEP]we opted to have ours in our room because their breafst room is pretty smal.[SEP]so they would bring it to us every morning, no problem.[SEP]you can prchase a internet card for relatively cheap and it lasted us all week.[SEP]i highly recomment this hotel to anyone going to paris, you won't be dissapointed.[SEP]we will stay there again when we go back.
1	we have just returned from an 11 night stay at the hampton inn and would definitely recommend it.[SEP]the location is great - although the address is universal boulevard, if you go out of the back entrance you are on international drive within a few minutes.[SEP]the rooms are large and the beds are great![SEP]the only slight downside to the room is that the aircon is on the noisy side.[SEP]the breakfast is ample and as a lot of people going to conferences use the hotel, breakfast wasn't busy at all after 8.30am.[SEP]similarly we could always get a spot by the pool although, due to the extremely wet weather whilst we were there, we didn't lay out much![SEP]i have stayed in a number of hotels in the i drive area and this would definitely rate within my top 2.[SEP]oh, and they also serve complimentary freshly baked cookies on some evenings!
1	my wife and here stayed here for 2 nights, and for our needs it was ideal.[SEP]- location: it is roughly equidistant between notre dame and the eiffel tower (around 2 miles to each), so perfectly walkable if you have a decent pair of shoes.[SEP]however, there is a metro stop a 2 minute walk away, which takes you to concorde if you prefer.[SEP]the local area also seems to be more typically parisian - i.e. small, independent shops rather than chains.[SEP]- hotel: the exterior and reception are beautiful, and seem much better than you have any right to expect from a 3 * hotel.[SEP]- staff: this won't matter to everyone, but our french isn't great so to have a staff that speak great english is a great help.[SEP]for example, i wanted some moules et frites while i was there, and i was directed to somewhere that was great.[SEP]they also offered a shuttle service to the airport upon check - in, which when you're on limited time is a great help.[SEP]- rooms: the rooms aren't cavernous, but should suit your needs perfectly.[SEP]very well kept too.[SEP]all in all, considering how expensive paris can be, this hotel offers good value in a great location.
1	we (my girlfriend and i) spent four nights at the hotel in room 13.[SEP]the room was clean, with a tv, ipod dock and wifi, two small balconies, a big comfortable bed and a view of boulevard voltaire.[SEP]the room was small but then they all are in paris.[SEP]it was stylishly decorated and very quiet considering the location.[SEP]the bathroom was really nice, with a rainforest style shower head and unlimited hot water.[SEP]the location is excellent, the hotel is across the road from rue de boulets metro station and within walking distance of two others, nation and charonne.[SEP]as you'd expect there are lots of nice cafes and boulangeries nearby and a couple of convenience shops also.[SEP]the best thing about this hotel was the staff.[SEP]the reception is manned 24/7.[SEP]whilst we stayed there we mainly saw ian and nicolas.[SEP]both were extremely helpful, funny and made you feel at home.[SEP]they speak several languages each and were conversing with guests in portuguese, german, english, arabic and french.[SEP]they recommended good restaurants and also checked my choices to see if they were in good areas.[SEP]they also booked the restaurants on our behalf to avoid any mishaps with my poor french.[SEP]they recommended les galopins, which is nearby and was excellent.[SEP]they arranged free laundry service and on checkout were happy to hold our considerable luggage while we enjoyed out last afternoon in paris.[SEP]we plan to return to paris and would choose grand hotel francais again.[SEP](the professional photos are accurate, our room was the one that comes up first)
1	ok, let's start with the negatives.[SEP]the rooms are small, the bathrooms are smaller and the stairs are steep and narrow.[SEP]however the location is great - right on the singel canal close to spui.[SEP]when you make your reservation ask for a room facing the canal.[SEP]you can walk to any of the major tourist areas in 15 minutes at the most.[SEP]the koninkijk palaeis is 5 minutes away or less and the flower market no more than 10.[SEP]we loved the location.[SEP]the staff was friendly and were great with restaurant recommendations and suggestions as to what to do.[SEP]boris and the boys will take good care of you.[SEP]they will willingly carry your bags up and down the stairs.[SEP]flying in from the us we got there well before our rooms were ready so we were allowed to keep our bags in the back room which was relatively secure.[SEP]when we go back to amsterdam - and we will - we will go back to hotel hoksbergen or one very close to it.[SEP]this was the first stop on our honeymoon.
1	very nice boutique hotel in an excellent location.[SEP]the rooms were clean, good - sized, and well appointed.[SEP]my husband and i were both surprised at how comfy the beds were![SEP]the front desk and concierge staff were very helpful and welcoming.[SEP]we didn't try the restaurant during our stay b / c san fran has so many other awesome ones to choose from.[SEP]the only negative for us was our proximity to the cable car line.[SEP]the bells were ringing constantly![SEP]it might be helpful to take that factor into account when requesting a room.
1	we stayed 3 nights in may 2010 and i have to say that the boardwalk is the best choice for me.[SEP]the rooms are very large and sleep up to 5 people.[SEP]what i liked most was the location as the hotel is situated between epcot and disney's hollywood studios, which means that you can easily enjoy the pool in the afternoon and hop back to the parks afterwards (i always bothers me at walt disney world, that you can not walk from your hotel to the parks).[SEP]it takes 5 minutes to walk to epcot and 15 to disney's hollywood studios.[SEP]i also loved the pool which features a great toboggan run.[SEP]+ newly refurbished and beautiful rooms with iphone charger, in walking distance to epcot and disney's hollywood studios, 1 great family pool with huge toboggan run and 2 quite pools - no free wireless internet access (10,-$for wired 24 hours access), no real restaurant in the hotel as they are all located on the boardwalk
1	my friend and i stayed here for 5 nights in feb 2010.[SEP]it was my 2nd trip to new york and i was impressed with the huge size of the room - for a new york hotel.[SEP]we had a double bed each and a great bathroom - again with plenty of room.[SEP]the location of the hotel is fantastic - you can walk to most places or catch a taxi from directly outside.[SEP]we usually ate out and about but did eat in the restaurant and the bar on a few occasions as it is just so easy.[SEP]it is not cheap but the food is lovely and perfect if you just want to relax after a hard day's sightseeing![SEP]i would stay at this hotel again as it didn't feel like a dated, tiny city hotel - the only down side is how busy it gets and sometimes it is hard to find somewhere to sit in the bar / public areas.[SEP]there are a lot of conferences being held here.[SEP]however, once in your room, you do not hear a thing and we slept really well every night in the comfy beds.[SEP]would definitely recommend to stay here.
1	we chose this hotel for the pool and we were not disappointed: it is absolutely fantastic with amazing views.[SEP]the pool is heated and not deep which was perfect for the children.[SEP]the location is also great.[SEP]the big disappointment was the service: staff just does not seem to care.[SEP]we ordered food in the terrasse and it took them more than one hour to bring us the food.[SEP]the manager came to apologise and offered us some wine to make up.[SEP]some people were served very quickly and some (like us) seemed to be less lucky, not sure why.[SEP]in the evening we ordered some chocolate ice cream and after waiting for more than 30mn we gave up and cancelled... in the bathroom there is no conditioner, i called concierge to ask where i could find some and i was told " the hotel has many things but not conditioner " in a very condescending tone.... so be warned the service is not good, but the pool is well worth it!
1	this hotel is blocks from the colosseum, but still relatively quiet.[SEP]it was a great location to take breaks and then go back and sight see some more.[SEP]rome has a lot of traffic during the day, and cars did cut through, but the hotel is soundproofed quite well.[SEP]it has a nice upstairs terrace where breakfast is served and from which you can see the colosseum clearly.[SEP]the rooms each had a separate bath.[SEP]one had a shower and the other a tub shower.[SEP]the rooms are adequate size.[SEP]we were able to shut off a hallway door to create a suite of sorts for our 2 rooms, which was nice.[SEP]we spent 3 nights there and found the staff to be accomodating.[SEP]we do not recommend the crab restaurant down the street, however.[SEP]it was recommended to us by the hotel, but we found it to be overpriced for adequate food.[SEP]there is a restaurant several blocks away near the sign for " tratoria " which was excellent.[SEP]it is on the corner, same side of the street before the tratoria.[SEP]the biggest disappointment we had was the spanish steps -- just a bunch of steps.[SEP]unless you are planning on shopping there, skip it.
1	i stayed in this beautiful historic hotel for 3 nights while visiting la.[SEP]the gorgeous lobby and bar area gives you a feeling of nostalgia.[SEP]the home of the oscars in the 30's and beyond, this hotel has a special air about it.[SEP]the gallery bar was a busy but fun place to end our evenings.[SEP]we arrived early in the am fully prepared to leave our luggage and check in later in the afternoon.[SEP]we were pleasantly surprised when they checked us in immediately and we were in our room by 10 am.[SEP]our room was very large with plenty of space for the 4 of us to spread out.[SEP]the beds were comfortable and our room location was very quiet.[SEP]the concierge was extremely helpful in hiring a driver to take us around la for the day as well as recommending restaurants in the area thatt were outstanding.[SEP]i would not hesitate to recommend staying at this hotel and can't wait to stay there again.
1	we stayed at the world quest resort for three nights with our 9 year old grand daughter.[SEP]this is a condo property and our two bedroom unit was very roomy and clean.[SEP]our unit had a large screened in balcony and full kitchen.[SEP]we were on the fourth floor and overlooked the lake.[SEP]the large pool was in a great location and was gated as was the front entrance of the property.[SEP]we did know there were neighbors upstairs but nothing bothersome.[SEP]we did have to ask for house cleaning after our 2nd day there.[SEP]this property is located within a couple miles of the disney parks and there are many restaurants within a couple miles of this property as well.[SEP]to sum it up the condo is in good shape, nicely appointed, has great views of the lake, roomy bedrooms, baths, kitchen and living space and is in a great location.
1	what an amazing trip.[SEP]the garden view room was wonderful.[SEP]so clean, newly refurbished and was huge.[SEP]it even had a kitchenette that i wasn't expecting.[SEP]staff was so helpful.[SEP]and the location was perfect, close to everything we wanted to see.[SEP]the gardens were lavish, the restaurant wonderful it and the beach was perfect.[SEP]i highly recommend this hotel
1	great service, great rooms, great location.[SEP]worth the money.[SEP]we thought all deserved a big' wow'.[SEP]indeed, not the average basic hotel furniture.[SEP]the rooms were really nicely set up, and the view that we paid for, was well worth it: right on the beach, looking at the palms and the ocean and listening to the gentle waves.... absolutely, beautiful and romantic..[SEP]the hotel is some half hour drive from the san diego city, in the famous la jolla area.[SEP]while the area has few main streets, it is big enough for interesting walks and even better shopping.[SEP]believe me you don't have to go to the city for that, plenty around in the proximity of the hotel.[SEP]staff were really nice and eager to assist with any enquires that we had (it's just that our postcards that we gave them to post on our behalf, arrived 3 weeks later...).[SEP]we had continental breakfast included in our price, but it was very, very basic.[SEP]you really had to pay to get decent breakfast.[SEP]plenty of restaurants around though, including ihop![SEP]the hotel has their own underground secure parking (for a fee of course), but we parked on the street as there was plenty of room and it was for free.[SEP]the area seemed trouble free and safe enough, so no problems encountered.[SEP]overall, good hotel, well maintained, great service and nice location.[SEP]highly recommended.
1	as a couple who loves modern style and design, this place was great for us.[SEP]if you're not then i wouldn't recommend it.[SEP]rooftop pool and bar are fantastic and we utilised them both.[SEP]a morning swim on the top of the standard truly was an experience.[SEP]they upgraded our room as we were on our honeymoon.[SEP]room was well - designed and felt luxurious.[SEP]the wifi didn't work in our room which was hugely frustrating.[SEP]receptionist didn't seem to care when we reported it so we spent a lot of time at the rooftop bar where the wifi did work.[SEP]maybe that's what they want you to do.[SEP]we found parking a few blocks from the hotel for $15 per night which is better than $30 at the standard.[SEP]the location's not great for going out.[SEP]downtown more - or - less shuts down at night so we ended up paying a lot for parking as we were taking the car in and out of parking to go out in other parts of la.
1	stayed at the hyatt regency on business for 3 nights.[SEP]can't comment much on the location and nearby amenities -- there's certainly food, shopping and parks nearby.[SEP]however, much of this seems to be concentrated in miami beach.[SEP]it is on the river and this provides a nice place to take a timeout.[SEP]as for the hotel, it was one of my best stays.[SEP]first and foremost, the staff are incredibly nice and it's obvious that they pride themselves on this.[SEP]you won't be disappointed when you need assistance or have questions.[SEP]secondly, the room was exceptionally clean.[SEP]finally, the overall ambiance and decor of the entire hotel was comforting and calm.[SEP]since i usually travel for pleasure and pay out of pocket, i'm more concerned about location and nearby amenities.[SEP]however, since this was a business trip and i spent most of my time indoors for a conference, i found this hotel to exceed my expectations in every way.
1	on arrival we requested a room with a view and this was arranged with little fuss.[SEP]the hotel is in a great location (walking distance of the forum / palatino / colosseum) and the views are stunning.[SEP]exceptionally clean in all areas.[SEP]welcoming and pleasant staff at all levels.[SEP]particular thanks to maria, anna, ariel and dante.
1	we were here only for 2 nights.[SEP]their website implies that this is a more upscale hotel than it really is (... recently renovated... bath robes... microwaves... free internet access).[SEP]may have been recently renovated, but the carpeting in our room was stained, there were no bath robes, no microwave and the internet access was not usable - we kept losing the connection.[SEP]the shower was extremely slow draining.[SEP]we told the front desk about this problem on our way out the first day and were told they would take care of it.[SEP]that night when my daughter showered the tub was half full by the time she was done.[SEP]it did not appear that they did anything about it.[SEP]when we checked out we mentioned it again (just to let them know) and they appologized and gave us a $50 gift card good for our next visit.[SEP]they seem to have a ready supply of these for those who are not pleased with the hotel.[SEP]now on the plus side - the location is great.[SEP]the hotel is located right on the boardwalk in pacific beach.[SEP]parking is included with the room and there are many good restaurants within walking distance.[SEP]so i guess it all depends what you are looking for luxury or a great location at an affordable price.
1	very nice hotel, good location.[SEP]very friendly staff.[SEP]nice breakfast.[SEP]all main tourist actractions are within walking distance.[SEP]many nice restaurants in neigborhood, e.g. klos (great ribs!).[SEP]easy to take a bus from airport to leidseplein (cost 4 â‚¬).[SEP]the room was small but big enough for 2 persons for sleeping.[SEP]the room was clean, and luckily we got a room from the backside since the street was very noisy during the weekend.[SEP]definitely recommend!
1	stayed here for 4 nights with my girlfriend.[SEP]hk was the final leg of our 6 week trip around south east asia.[SEP]this was undoubtedly one of our favourite hotels.[SEP]we booked thru agoda and got a reasonable rate.[SEP]the rooms were very nice and clean.[SEP]sleek and modern with a nice flat screen tv and great shower.[SEP]also a great view from our room on the 21st floor.[SEP]air conditioning worked great.[SEP]hotel location was amazing.[SEP]5 minute walk from causeway bay mtr.[SEP]it was so easy to get around everywhere![SEP]and if you need a taxi, you can grab one anywhere on lockhart road.[SEP]another major plus was the free wifi.[SEP]it worked very well at all times![SEP]and a complimentary desktop pc in the reception area as well.[SEP]the staff were not particularly amazing, but they were nice enough.[SEP]simply put, i feel like we got what we paid for.[SEP]and maybe a bit more.[SEP]i would definitely stay here again!
1	i traveled with a few colleagues for 2 days then my wife caught up with me over the weekend.[SEP]we had a blast.[SEP]very nice city and the hard rock was in a perfect location to tour the gas lamp.[SEP]if we didn't want to look around the city, we would have been very content hanging out in the hotel the whole time.[SEP]the hard rock meshes a hotel and entertainment very well.
1	we just returned from a two night stay during the year - end holiday.[SEP]the location is very convenient next to the old quarter and the nightly " action " on the ramblas avenue.[SEP]the action here unfortunately has double meaning: the first night as i was returning to the hotel two north african men tried to mug me right at the entrance to the hotel.[SEP]i managed to escape inside and asked the hotel personnel to alert the police which they did.[SEP]nobody seemed to care much, however, and the hotel staff actually seemed used to these thugs hovering around the hotel prying for victims.[SEP]aside of this, the room we got was thoroughly dirty with what seemed like dust from construction.[SEP]the staff was only able to clean it the next day.[SEP]given the high price and all this trouble and risk, next time we will go to a different hotel in this wonderful city.
1	i needed some r & r for a couple days and i found quiet, deep sleeps at l'hermitage.[SEP]the staff was' over and above' helpful.[SEP]every person that i saw (concierge, maids, etc.) smiled and engaged me in conversation.[SEP]they looked happy... and you can't really fake' happy'.[SEP]the room decor was modern and simple.[SEP]comfortable bed.[SEP]although i used the workout room, i did not use the pool or hot tub this time around.[SEP]the location was a perfect jumping point to all the exploring i wanted to do.[SEP]the transit system in vancouver is so easy to understand... and affordable.[SEP]however, i mostly walked... because it was sunny... and i had the time ;)
1	the staff at the hotel were very welcoming and helpful throughout my stay.[SEP]the room was clean and the bed very comfortable (king size with great duvet and lots of pillows).[SEP]bathroom is small (no bath), but clean and has hairdriers etc.[SEP]hotel decor is slightly dated, but doesn't impact on the stay.[SEP]the hotel was quiet.[SEP]the location is great for shopping on 5th ave etc and near enough to the subway to get up and downtown.
1	this was my third time in orlando and this was by far the best hotel yet.[SEP]good location on the quiet bit of international drive, near to premium outlets.[SEP]15 mins to disney and universal, 5 mins to seaworld.[SEP]rooms where a good size, 6 adults staying in a 3 bedroom apartment, and it still felt spacious.[SEP]plus our balcony looked out towards disney which meant we saw the fireworks almost every night.[SEP]the pool area was well maintained but was sightly small for the size of the complex.[SEP]staff where friendly and always happy to help.[SEP]overall a great hotel and for the price very hard to beat.
1	we stayed one night in the paris hotel.[SEP]a lost stop on our way home to ca.[SEP]my daughter loves paris and thought it would be nice and fun for her.[SEP]she loved the decor of lobby, shops and obviously the tower.[SEP]i wasn't a big fan of the rooms and halls leading you to them.[SEP]its outdated and although clean but needs a touch up may be a lil paint.[SEP]our was eh, the tv was missing a button and furniture again outdated.[SEP]get the frenchy decour kept that but get new sheets and furniture.[SEP]bathrooms are nice in size.[SEP]beds were ok comfortable.[SEP]our view was the best but i did pay extra for it.[SEP]the location was great.
1	acceptable size room and bathroom (also for two persons).[SEP]good location close to a major station (roma tiburtina).[SEP]acceptable continental breakfast with a moderate selection of food.[SEP]free wireless internet.[SEP]only little traffic noise.
1	to put it bluntly the excelsior is a dump and needs a major renovation.[SEP]i am really surprised that the oriental hotel group doesn't have a problem attaching its name to the property.[SEP]the one exception is that the service from the staff was up to mandarin oriental par.[SEP]the rooms were really quite small, run down and not the most comfortable.[SEP]i ate in the hotel once at the buffet for lunch and was not thrilled.[SEP]decent location, good business services, good car service although it is prohibitively expensive.[SEP]i would only stay there again simply because the rates tend to be much better than most other hong kong hotels.
1	location is perfect.[SEP]near the main attractions but off the beaten path.[SEP]staff are a joy.[SEP]the ambiance is top drawer.[SEP]we stayed for a week in the " corner suite " and were very pleased.[SEP]although the hotel is situated near the tourist sites the feeling of the area is very " local ".[SEP]check out the small bazaar nearby.[SEP]expensive but some top quality items.[SEP]for example, a french - canadian woman runs a textile shop that keeps traditional techniques going in the hinterland which she then sells through this shop.[SEP]superb.[SEP]wifi could be improved.[SEP]somewhat spotty coverage.
1	overall our stay at the time was good.[SEP]it was in a fantastic location, just off times sqaure and we were there for new years so we just walked straight out into all of the action![SEP]it was in midtown so we could get everywhere really easily.[SEP]the bar was very nice and so was breakfast although it was a tad overpriced.[SEP]the room service food was not so great and we got charged after we left for some room service we had paid for in cash.[SEP]it seems as though the room service man must have pocketed the money and said we hadn't paid for it so that was a bit annoying.[SEP]apart from that the staff were very nice and there were always two people standing outside ready to help with bags or call a taxi.[SEP]the bed were very comfy (very important!) and the bathroom was nice (moltan brown toiletries!) and the room was always cleaned very well every day.[SEP]overall, nice hotel, great location, i am still annoyed about the bloke pocketing our money though!
1	rooms were clean and supplied with everything we needed.[SEP]perfect place for a very laid back vacation.[SEP]great location to shopping and grocery stores.[SEP]beach view was great and am planning on being back next year with the kids.[SEP]mom promised a trip to florida for a graduation present but after he seen the pictures this is the place he wants to come to.[SEP]ca nt wait to come back.[SEP]dawn
1	after studying trip advisor in depth, my wife and i chose hotel residence foch for our stay in paris march 14 - 19.[SEP]i can not over - emphasize how pleased we were with the hotel (and with trip advisor for cluing us to it).[SEP]we travel extensively and i can honestly say that we have never met a friendlier or more helpful staff than the one nelly has assembled.[SEP]from the moment isobel welcomed us to the hotel to the moment bao waved goodbye to our taxi from the sidewalk, the experience was a real joy.[SEP]everything is as advertised and as others have described -- a great bargain, a lovely little breakfast arrangement, quiet location in a residential neighborhood.[SEP]this last may seem a negative to some -- but get a metro pass (the hotel's a five minute walk from both metro and rer) and take the # 1 train to the heart of paris, minutes away.[SEP]we thought staying in the 16th had its own pleasures anyway, and the hotel staff will direct you to local restaurants if you want to stay in the area for dinner.[SEP]our room (# 14) was small but immaculate, and perfectly quiet except for some brief vendor noise (the linen delivery truck) one night.[SEP]we will think of this small hotel as our home - away - from - home in paris from now on -- such was the degree to which we were made to feel welcome and at ease, setting the stage for a delightful stay overall.[SEP]congrats to nelly and company, and thanks again to trip advisor and previous reviewers.
1	i am in this neighborhood for work often.[SEP]i have tried the four points (eh), the doubletree (not bad), and the affinia (steer clear) - but i am going to be staying at the eventi going forward - no question.[SEP]pros: great location (near penn station) 630am (free!) morning pilates class - sign up the night before, they give you a wake up / reminder call free internet - if you sign up for kimpton rewards program, no big deal quiet - i had a room on the 21st floor, no street noise great view wonderful, clean, brand new gym big and beautiful bathroom security - they check to make sure you are a guest before letting you go up the elevator in the evening cons: bedroom was small - but it's nyc, so what can you do?[SEP](there is a full service spa on site, i did not try.[SEP]nor did i try the restaurant or room service.) there is a very fun outdoor seating area connected with their " food court " - aka foodparc - which is a perfect place for a quick snack, or night time frozen yogurt.
1	stayed here 3 nights, july 16 - july 18.[SEP]since this was our visit to new york, we stayed in on of their rooms on the top 5 floors, facing empire state building.[SEP]the view was okay, but i could have honestly skipped it and saved the money.[SEP]however, the big advantage about being that high was you couldn't here any of the sirens or street noise, so that was a plus![SEP]the room size was smaller than usual (in terms of room size in other cities) but it was adequate for our stay in manhattan.[SEP]it was clean and the service staff was great.[SEP]the two elevators are quite slow at times.[SEP]luckily we didn't go in and out a lot so the wait wasn't all that bad.[SEP]the air condionning in our room worked great, which was key because it was over 100 degrees during the day with the humidity.[SEP]we slept great![SEP]the best part was the location.[SEP]we walked to time square a couple of times (there and back) without any problems.[SEP]i'd consider staying here again if we're ever in nyc.
1	we booked here purely for the location.[SEP]the check in was poor, long queues and disinterested staff.[SEP]there is no facility to leave luggage if you arrive early and want to hit the sites.[SEP]the whole place is tired and lacks professionalism.[SEP]the rooms were adequate but again, need love and care.[SEP]the best thing is that check out is 12 noon so you don't have to head off too eary.[SEP]the cafe doesn't open until 5 pm which is bizarre.[SEP]overall, a great location but a second rate hotel which needs a refurb and management who care.
1	myself & wife stayed at this hotel last weekend (20~23 jan) and we were very happy with the overall service we received.[SEP]we stayed there from friday ~ monday and have absolutely no complaints at all and would absolutely recommend it.[SEP]the location of the hotel is perfect for all of the major tourist locations around rome and it is only a few minutes walk from the local tube station.[SEP]the staff were extremely friendly and the hotel was clean and everything we needed for a long weekend break.[SEP]as you would expect the staff were extremely knowledgeable of the local area and spoke really good english and were more than happy to help us out.[SEP]there was an additional charge of 7 euros for internet access in the room for the trip, which i think is reasonable.[SEP]when we go back to rome we would stay here again.[SEP]wayne & sadie (swindon - uk)
1	we are just back from staying at this hotel for three nights.[SEP]we really enjoyed our stay at the hotel elysees regencia.[SEP]the hotel is tastefully decorated and has very modern decor.[SEP]the rooms are small but have everything you need and are impecably decorated.[SEP]the rooms are very clean and well stocked with towels, toiletries, slippers and bathrobes.[SEP]upon arrival the staff were very welcoming and spoke very good english.[SEP]they were very helpful throughout our stay offering advice and even providing print out maps with directions.[SEP]the breakfast was lovely- however we felt perhaps a bit pricey at € 18 per head.[SEP]having said that- we would highly recommend staying at this hotel- clean, modern, great location and wonderful staff.
1	we spent 3 days at this hotel and loved the location - nice walks along the water and as we had a car it was an easy drive to shopping centres and other areas of this lovely city.[SEP]free parking, a very nice complimentary breakfast (including hot and cold choices - make your own waffles is fun) and a basic but filling dinner each night - also complimentary and very good value.[SEP]we had a two bedroom suite and it was spacious with bathrooms in each room and a full kitchen, which came in very useful.[SEP]it was very modern and the maid service was wonderful and it was lovely to get back after a long day out to a room that was comfortable and clean.[SEP]laundry facilities were great and very user friendly.[SEP]check in and check out was a breeze.[SEP]we would highly recommend this hotel to others and would definitely stay again if we visited san diego in the future.
1	we always like to stay here when we go to nyc.[SEP]it is right in the heart of times square.[SEP]all the rooms we have stayed at have been the same nice decor and size typical of hotels in its class in nyc.[SEP]wish they still ahd their free breakfast pre renovation, but having free internet and a great location more than make up for that.[SEP]staff appear to be well trained to give personlized service to each guest and we enjoy this service.
1	i took my daughter to nyc for her 13th birthday.[SEP]she had never been to nyc.[SEP]we had a wonderful experience.[SEP]this hotel is luxury.[SEP]my daughter felt like a " movie star ".[SEP]the staff here is unbelieveably helpful and friendly.[SEP]they remembered that it was my daughter's birthday trip and from check - in things were amazing.[SEP]special presents in the room for my daugher, a great view of the city, birthday cake and cards!![SEP]they answer every question promptly and professionally.[SEP]i can not say enough about how wonderful our experience was and how great the staff was.[SEP]hotel is quiet and a great location.[SEP]walked to wicked, basically walked everywhere!![SEP]felt extremely safe here too.
1	the royal in playa is the best![SEP]great vacation and sooo relaxing.[SEP]resort is very clean.[SEP]there are always workers cleaning.[SEP]food was great.[SEP]service was excellent.[SEP]beds are super comfortable.[SEP]we love the location, easy to walk around 5th ave and shop / sight see.[SEP]can't wait to go back!
1	we stayed at the erboy for four nights end of september 2010.[SEP]the hotel is in a perfection location for most of the sights in instanbul - grand bazaar, spice market, palace, mosques and bosphorus river.[SEP]it is also very close to the tram line.[SEP]we were upgraded and our room was very spacious, had a good size bathroom and shower, and very comfortable bed.[SEP]tea and coffee facilities are there for you in the room.[SEP]breakfast was good with cereals, scrambled eggs, cold meats, and fruit and yoghart, though busy around 8.00a.m. but nothing to worry about.[SEP]we had a free one way transfer from the airport to the hotel, and it only cost 20 turish lira for a transfer to the airport when we left.[SEP]we received a free dinner on our first night and was very impressed with the meal and service.[SEP]there are other restaurants around the corner also with good meals.[SEP]there is also free internet service.[SEP]we would definitely recommend this hotel and would definitely stay at the erboy hotel again.[SEP]thanks erboy hotel for a lovely stay.[SEP]- sid and lesley welsh - brisbane, australia.
1	spacious rooms we stayed here the first of october for a week.[SEP]since we were celebrating a special anniversary we were upgraded to a jr.[SEP]suite.[SEP]what a lovely, spacious room it was too.[SEP]plus, shortly after we arrived in our room a complimentary bottle of champagne and a bowl of gourmet olives was delivered to us.[SEP]it was absolutely perfect.[SEP]the hotel is in a great location also.[SEP]really close to shopping on oxford street and close enough to walk to covent gardens.[SEP]we weren't crazy about the restaurant after a breakfast there but did have snacks from room service, which was fine.[SEP]i only have 2 complaints and they are minimal.[SEP]we didn't like any of the restaurants that the concierge recommended.[SEP]in fact, we walked out of several places be cause we we the only people there and they didn't look very clean either.[SEP]we got the feeling they (concierge   restaurant) were working together.[SEP]usually at night we would stop at the honor bar for 2 glasses of ice to take to our room- quicker than room service and there was usually some employee(same one always) who would watch us like we were stealing something.[SEP]like you don't mind paying their high room rates but not a couple of bucks for a coke if you wanted.[SEP]he just made us feel uncomfortable every night.[SEP]but, all in all, we would stay there again because it really is a gorgeous hotel in a great location.
1	after booking this hotel on lastminute.com and getting a great deal as it was one of their' secret hotels' i had grave concerns due to some of the ridiculous reviews that it had been given.[SEP]the hotel itself is in an excellent location, the metro is located virtually on the doorstep.[SEP]the metro system is great for travelling around town and should you choose to walk la rambla is a few minutes away.[SEP]we were upgraded to a suite, there are only 3 in the hotel, unsure why seems we had paid such a low price - guess we just got lucky![SEP]the hotel has a small pool which is great for taking a dip, and the views are spectacular, although can get a bit windy up there![SEP]the buffet breakfast was great value for money.[SEP]the overall appearence of the hotel was clean and the staff friendly.[SEP]do nt believe the hype!, we travelled around barcelona and took the usual safety precuations, just use your head its a city after all with all the usual pickpockets, beggars etc.[SEP]we were on our guard due to all the reports back home about pickpocketing, mugging etc!![SEP]you just have to be cautious at all times.[SEP]sure parts of the town are probably undesirable at night but just use your noddle and do nt let this ruin a great city break - hope you enjoy the universal as much as we did!!
1	cute hotel in a awesome location!!![SEP]our room was very clean and the staff is very nice.[SEP]whatever we needed, they got it.[SEP]the price was also very good.[SEP]i would recommend staying here if you want a clean room in a great location!
1	this hotel gave us a friendly welcome and were always on hand to answer any questions, even when we attempted them in french.[SEP]everything was of good but not excessive quality and bathroom and room were very clean.[SEP]the owners obviously choose their staff carefully because everyone from breakfast to night porter were great.[SEP]we had a room by the lift and were concerned about noise but there was none.[SEP]our room was neither too small or too spaced out and had a surprise balcony through the bathroom (rm 50).[SEP]so we enjoyed a cosy three night stay in a well to do location in paris, with breakfast on the balcony and dinner in some superb local restaurants.[SEP]from the residence foch you can walk to the arc d'triomphe, the eiffel tower and the local metro took us to the centre and to versailles (via rer) no problems.[SEP]would recommend & would go back.
1	this is an outstanding hotel with an excellent staff.[SEP]the rooms have everything you need with very comfortable beds.[SEP]the bar is quite pricey downstairs and their breakfast and room service prices are absolutely ridiculously expensive.[SEP]they would sell a lot more of each of those categories if they didn't charge so much.[SEP]the location is unbeatable (unless you have the scratch to stay in the ritz.). highly recommended.
1	stayed at the bellagio 12/1 - 12/4 2010.[SEP]we loved the hotel, the location, casino ambiance, restaurants, the crowd all very excellent.[SEP]the spa was a great value for 3 days/$70.[SEP]i have stayed at palazzzo too before, i must say the rooms are way smaller and less modern than what you find in palazzo, for example, the tv was still an old tube tv (~y2 k model) which was unexpected in a 5-star hotel nowadays.[SEP]the bathroom was roomy and clean.[SEP]overall, i recommend the bellagio if you enjoy finer things in life.
1	we traded our time share to stay at summer bay.[SEP]we liked the location, easy access from koval lane, no need to drive down the busy strip.[SEP]the grounds are well kept.[SEP]we used the public barbecues several times and they were clean.[SEP]however, we had trouble getting utensils from housekeeping as they do not give them out due to people stealing them.[SEP]if you plan to barbecue, bring your own utensils, or buy them when you get to las vegas.[SEP]our condo was small, but functional.[SEP]it sleeps four but i would not recommend more than 2 people in it.[SEP]comfortable king sized bed, two flat screen tv's.[SEP]the walk in closet was great for storage of our clothing and shoes as well as our suitcases.[SEP]there was a safe in the closet as well.[SEP]the bathtub was huge but the vanity was small so no space to put your toiletries.[SEP]we had quite a time getting service though.[SEP]first of all we couldn't get barbecue utensils, then we needed maintenance to come as our toilet wouldn't stop flushing.[SEP]we had to call three times to get the maids to come to do our weekly cleaning.[SEP]one finally showed up at the end of the day while i was in the middle of making supper.[SEP]because the maids wouldn't come, we asked for clean tea towels and a dish cloth and they brought us bath towels.[SEP]we have never stayed anywhere where the maid service is so poor![SEP]there is plenty of parking and the shuttle service is reliable and friendly.
1	i stayed here for six nights with my one year old and my mother.[SEP]it was absolutely fantastic - central but quiet and you could watch the gondolas right outside the window floating down the canal.[SEP]the hotel supplied a high chair and cot and it was very easy to cater due to the excellent kitchen facilities within the apartment.[SEP]i slept in the lounge diner, my baby slept in a walk in wardrobe area and i let grandma have the main bedroom.[SEP]there were two bathrooms.[SEP]it was all spotless, loads of space and very tasteful with lovely wooden beamed ceilings.[SEP]it is certainly a bargain considering the standard and location.[SEP]you felt totally part of the action even whilst eating your breakfast, as you watched the gondolas float by.[SEP]st marks square is less than five mins walk and the rialto about 7 mins.[SEP]one recommendation if you are travelling with a baby - take a backpack type thing as carrying prams over all the bridges which have stairs cut into them and which are everywhere is not great for the back![SEP]the water taxi took us too and from the airport and went right to the front door - don't let them tell you the water is too high - they said that to us but then when they realised we had a baby they magically managed to get us right to the hotel by canal!
1	we hosted our son and daughter - in - law's destination wedding in san diego last weekend.[SEP]the wedding was in balboa park and we needed a local hotel that could accommodate our many out - of - town guests.[SEP]our family and friends ended up reserving 113 room nights.[SEP]the hotel staff could not have been more accommodating.[SEP]special kudos to our contact, spencer priest and the front desk manager, kirk.[SEP]our price included breakfast so they provided a special room (with a private buffet) for us the morning after the wedding for around 100 guests, for no extra charge.[SEP]we were able to share another meal with our departing guests in a private room.[SEP]the hotel has and indoor / outdoor pool and a fitness center with up - to - date machines.[SEP]the lobby had plenty of space for us to meet and chat with our guests.[SEP]the location was excellent, right off the 163, close to everything.[SEP]an upscale strip mall is attached which had a great sports bar where many of our guests had some meals.[SEP]the mall also had nail and hair salons for our bridal party.[SEP]the hotel has been redone, so you feel like you're in an upscale 4 or 5-star hotel, but at 3-star prices.[SEP]the rooms are decorated in warm, contemporary decor and the beds are very comfortable.[SEP]there are pictures on their website.[SEP]of course, don't forget about the unlimited warm chocolate chip cookies!
1	we recently stayed at this property the night before checking in to a disney property.[SEP]the location was very good and breakfast was nice also.[SEP]we typically stay at hampton inns / homewood suites so i know what to expect.[SEP]this to me was an average hotel.[SEP]you could see some of the wear -- hallway carpets were somewhat stained and the rooms also had some staining on the carpets and spots on walls.[SEP]they were overall clean but by no means what i have come to expect when staying in a homewood suites.[SEP]our sheets had some rips in them.[SEP]the pull out sofa bed was atrocious.[SEP]my daughter said she felt springs in her back all night long.[SEP]breakfast area was nice but the attendant was somewhat pushy and constantly " helping.[SEP]" yes i know how to cook a waffle and don't need help.[SEP]if i had asked that would be different.[SEP]she was just too helpful.[SEP]not meaning to be rude but this is offputting to some people, myself included.[SEP]would i stay here for an overnight trip again?[SEP]probably if the price was right.[SEP]would i stay for longer?[SEP]nope
1	my initial response was negative.[SEP]i checked into my room and found a pamphlet discussing the sleep expert crowne had on staff whose tips and herbal / aromatherapy remedies were going to provide the greatest night of sleep ever... as i listened to a jackhammer break up concrete on the front steps of the hotel.[SEP]fortunately, that was a fairly isolated incident.[SEP]during my five day stay at the crowne plaza, i came to enjoy the comforts of my room.[SEP]though my window faced an interior courtyard / passageway, the trade - off was that there was no outside noise.[SEP]i did sleep very well.[SEP]the location is excellent.[SEP]you can walk, take public transportation, or bike anywhere from the crowne.[SEP]the hotel is a little sterile, and had the ambiance of a hospital (albeit modern).[SEP]because of my ability to sleep there, and its great location, i would stay there again for the right price.[SEP]broadband internet runs about $30 a day.
1	great location, 15min walking oxford st., opposite to the most beautiful park in london: regents.[SEP]classic dã © cor, luxury in the old sense, huge room and bathroom, comfy king - size bed, professional, helpful staff.[SEP]spanish tourist london favourite is always packed with couples and families in a shopping spree to the city.[SEP]to be honest, the kind of place your parents would be happily stayed over.[SEP]recommended for whoever is looking for a quite, elegant place, spanish friendly (all the staff is either spanish or speaks the language) and those who rank location in the first place in their preferences.[SEP]it features an elegant spanish restaurant and a modern - eclectic one
1	we found hotel hoksbergen by searching tripadvisor and were very pleased.[SEP]the hotel was very cute and in the best location ever![SEP]there are plenty of nice shops and restaurants in the area.[SEP]we had one of the best chocolate tortes that we have ever eaten just around the corner from the hotel.[SEP]there is an italian restaurant down the street (along the single canal) called casa di david that was wonderful.[SEP]also along the canal was orange bike rentals.[SEP]the owner was so nice.[SEP]my husband and i wanted to rent bikes after he was already closed, and unfortunately were leaving for our flight in the morning before the bike shop would reopen.[SEP]the owner allowed us to keep the bikes overnight and chain them in front of hotel hokesbergen, the front desk attendent kept the key.[SEP]he allowed us to do this without keeping our id for colladeral which is typical.[SEP]the hotel was in such a beautiful area that one night we decided not to venture far and walked, ate dinner, sat in cafes, all within a few blocks of the hotel.[SEP]the rooms are typical for europe (small), but very clean.[SEP]should we return to amsterdam, we will certainly stay in hotel hokesbergen.
1	very friendly welcome, small triple room (two singles and a double sofa bed) but you don't go to amsterdam to party in your room.[SEP]a bit of a mountain to 3rd floor, but room was clean and beds very nice.[SEP]great location and lovely breakfast.[SEP]nice welcoming feel, would stay again.[SEP]for the money i was very pleased.
1	a quiet retreat in a busy city being country folk ourselves we were pretty overwhelmed by the busy - ness of florence.[SEP]god forbid you step off the narrow sidewalk.[SEP]you'll get hit by a bus / car / vespa.[SEP]but the monna lisa is set off on a very quiet street and, although our room had windows right over the street itself, we slept perfectly.[SEP]the help was helpful, the breakfasts wonderful and the location perfect - just steps away from fabulous restaurants and all the sites you'd want to see.[SEP]don't miss taking bus.[SEP]no.[SEP]7 to fiesole.[SEP]and top notch restaurants are: cibreo (sp?,) italiano and the one right across the street that was voted, top ten in tuscany.[SEP]the name escapes me but the concierge will know - it means place where they store the carousel in winter?[SEP]great side trip - sienna and sangerminano (sp?).[SEP]we did all the usual sights but wish we had time for the bargello museum - the old town hall and the archaeology museum
1	staff was friendly and very helpful.[SEP]the location was excellent as it was a short walk to grand central station.[SEP]the lobby is beautiful, the room was very comfortable, but the bathroom was pretty small.[SEP]the only complaint would be an odor on all the floors when you step out of the elevator but the room was perfect, no odor.[SEP]i will definitely stay there again!!
1	this was my 2nd stay at the intercontinental san juan.[SEP]once again, it was very clean and very nice.[SEP]we reserved a suite, which has a separate living room, tv and fridge.[SEP]there was another fridge and tv in the bedroom.[SEP]the staff was nice and helpful.[SEP]i liked the location.[SEP]isla verde is a public beach, and very clean for a public beach.[SEP]great diner across the street, very convenient.[SEP]love the fact that it was literally 5 mins from the airport.[SEP]great for a quick get away.[SEP]just a very easy, convenient trip and the beach is beautiful.[SEP]one silly thing that disappointed me was the fact that complimentary bottles of water were available at the towel desk during our last visit but not during this visit.[SEP]the pool is nice but a bit small.[SEP]the pool area is beautiful.[SEP]very lush, and nice landscaping - makes you feel like you are in your vey own oasis, which is how one should feel while on vacation.
1	stayed at this hotel, feb 2009 on an spg cash and points stay.[SEP]was impressed by the size of this hotel.[SEP]valet parking was fine, check in was a little slow as there was only one check - in agent manning the desk during our check - in.[SEP]but total wait time could not have been more than 5 mins.[SEP]had access to the club floor and lounge which is great value for the extra money.[SEP]continental bfast was more that i expected and very healthy.[SEP]one suggestion for management if they read this is for the 2nd floor free weight workout area.[SEP]i suggest they install mirrors on the wall behind the free weight rack.[SEP]these mirrors are pretty standard in gyms and i am surprised that the are not installed in a workout room of this caliber.[SEP]all in all a trouble free stay and i would return because of the excellent location.
1	i had a business trip to korea, and took a couple of night stopover in hk on the way back home to sydney.[SEP]this rate was cheap and i was sceptical about booking.[SEP]yes, my single room was small, but sparkling clean and fresh.[SEP]unless you want to work or spend all day in the room it should not be a problem.[SEP]there was the usual outside noise, as you will get anywhere in hk, but closing the window soon fixed this.[SEP]while some reviewers mentioned about the mis - alignment of the bathroom mirror and shadows caused by lighting, i did not notice this as a problem.[SEP]i don't think you would get a bathroom, minibar, or dvd player in your room at this price elsewhere in this central location.[SEP]i was satisfied with this hotel.[SEP]in fact i was checking reviews again because i am suprised again by the low price available for my next visit to hk![SEP]and will be staying again.
1	first trip to orlando and this hotel definitely was the best choice.[SEP]large comfy rooms, great beds (two doubles in room), nice bathroom with shower, plasma tv and all amenities.[SEP]hotel staff extremely friendly and helpful.[SEP]hotel is in good location, close to all the parks.[SEP]a definite place to go is discovery cove, bit expensive but well worth the price!![SEP]only warning, watch out for the time share vultures - they offer you great deals on tickets in return for viewing a time share property - then refuse to let you leave, very hard sellers and prob the only complaint about the whole holiday!
1	well located, gold crown resort.[SEP]contains about 8 condo buildings that appears to take up all their available real estate.[SEP]our 1 bedroom was comfortable but smaller that the typical gold crown 1 bdrm.[SEP]televisions had smaller screens than usual.[SEP]check in was very easy and pleasant.[SEP]no timeshare pressure at all.[SEP]there was a timeshare 2 hour tour offer available on site for $125 in tickets for a different condo company / location.[SEP]show tickets sold on site appear well discounted.[SEP]almost all show tickets in the $30 + area.[SEP]location here a big plus since 1) close to major intersection (entertainment / food) of " shepherd of the hills " and route 76, 2) across the road from cracker barrel, 3) can easily use east / west " green mountain road " or " shepherd of the hills " to avoid hwy 76 traffic hangups.[SEP]don't forget silver dollar city ticket option to enter at 3:00pm for free (closes at 6:00 followed by evening show) on day before your full day ticket.[SEP]if getting showboat general admission tickets, ask for level 2, section bb on left or right side.[SEP]the best level 1 seats are taken by bus groups.[SEP]food was so - so but 4 or 8:00pm show very good.
1	me & my husband stayed for 4 days at this hotel, we had a wonderful time, staff were very helpful and the hotel is clean and tidy.[SEP]great location all major attractions within easy walking distance.[SEP]cafe ruc across from the hotel was really nice, but on the expensive side, but food was fantastic.[SEP]if you want something a little cheaper there was a small traditional french restaurant approx 5 mins walk - can't remember the name but turn right out of the hotel and keep walk it's on the left hand side.[SEP]food was great real home made grub.
1	we have just come back from a 3 day/2 night stay in paris at hotel odeon saint - germain, which is in a lovely old paris town house full of character.[SEP]the staff couldn't have been more helpful or charming, from the management to the waitress.[SEP]the room was tastefully decorated, cosy, clean and well thought out, i especially liked the individual reading lights by the bed.[SEP]the bathroom (shower only) was compact but had everything we needed, our room (standard) overlooked the courtyard and so was lovely and quiet and the comfy beds added up to a good nights sleep.[SEP]we ordered breakfast and it was very good, with a wide choice of fresh food.[SEP]it was good value at 14e, especially if you ate as much as my husband![SEP]we didn't need lunch.[SEP]the location is excellent, close to odeon metro and a variety of good shops and restaurants.[SEP]the only problem a visitor might have is if they are very over weight.[SEP]the lift is tiny (we had great fun with our friends trying to fit in the three people it says that it holds) and the staircase steep and narrow, but from my experience this is typical in small paris boutique hotels.[SEP]i would definitely recommend the hotel and hope to stay there again when next we visit paris.
1	great location.[SEP]i stayed three nights with my husband and sister visiting us from london.[SEP]the hotel was walking distance from the mag mile, millenium park & art institute, john hancock tower, sears tower and the pier.[SEP]how can you go wrong if it literally takes 5 - 10 mins walk to the city's landmark and a good breakfast inclusive of your stay?[SEP]highly recommend everyone to stay here.
1	celebrated our 40th anniversary with a very fun trip to nyc.[SEP]the location was perfect for walking all midtown..[SEP](check out charming bryant park and the nyc library),and subway was right there for farther trips... including to and from lga![SEP]our room was large and clean, bed very comfy and staff regularly asked us if everything was ok......[SEP]a very generous continental bkfst started us every am.[SEP]we walked to del frisco's for a great steak dinner with an awesome view![SEP]it is obvious this hotel tries to please... thank you for a great visit to this wonderful city!!!
1	this is a small elegant hotel that is just around the corner from the metro and just behind the eiffel tower.[SEP]a perfect location.....[SEP]it is perfect for a getaway to paris.[SEP]the interior is fabulously decorated in a mix of italian design and french charm.[SEP]the reception is staffed with friendly knowledgeable people who can help with anything from finding a sushi place that delivers to a babysitter.[SEP]this is a jewel in the heart of one the world's most beautiful cities.[SEP]highly recommended!
1	stayed there in october.[SEP]great hotel.[SEP]very clean, nice and new furniture, very good breakfast.[SEP]of coures excellent location - you don't need any bus!![SEP]best hotel we stayed in italy.[SEP]if yoy are not used to hilton standards (it's not fancy), you will enjoy it a lot.[SEP]our room was quite big, so i guess there are different types of rooms.[SEP]the staff is friendly and nice.
1	we chose jj hotel for its price and location.[SEP]from the airport we took bus a-11 and got off at steward road opposite the caltex petrol pump.[SEP]the hotel is 7 - 8 min walk from the bus stop.[SEP]ask for wan chai road and it is right there.[SEP]we have two small children and had two suitcases but found the walk etc very comfortable.[SEP]the hotel is lcoated on 9 - 11 floor of lucky plaza and is on a busy street.[SEP]it is very close to causeway bay.....[SEP]10 min walk.[SEP]the times sqaure in causeway bay was very beautifully done up cos of christmas.[SEP]we also walked to the ferry station, took ferry to kowloon and then took bus to science museum which the kids loved as it is very interactive.[SEP]on our way back we saw " symphony of lights " which is a light and sound show where 44 buildings are lit up and there is music.[SEP]it happens every night at 8 pm.[SEP]there are several eating places around the jj hotel.[SEP]there is kfc, mc donald, and a pakistani food place just behind it.[SEP]the downside of the hotel is that though they are ok with two adults and two kids checking in but they refused to give the 4th pillow, sheet or towel.[SEP]they have a rule around giving only upto three items which was very strange.[SEP]the bathroom as described by others is glass but that did not bother us as one of us would take the kids out while the parent would take a bath.[SEP]overall a goog hotel in a great location.
1	this is a wonderful small hotel perfectly situated at pacific beach.[SEP]location - wise you are close to everything - in particular, the beach.[SEP]we stayed in a premium ocean view room - and, it was worth it.[SEP]the hotel itself is very nice, rooms are clean and very tasteful.[SEP]staff is friendly and helpful.[SEP]i was in town for a business meeting, and my wife came along for a mini - vacation.[SEP]rather than stay at the big box hotel where the conference was held, we stayed at pt and it definitely made the whole trip that much more enjoyable.
1	what a fantastic hotel.[SEP]brilliant location, just off orchard road and only a few minutes walk.[SEP]the room was a tower wing delux which was excellent, lots of room and really well presented.[SEP]the breakfast was to die for - i have never experience a range of food like it.[SEP]we also ate in the hotel one night which was also very good.[SEP]would def recomment this hotel.
1	as a regular solo traveller, i often feel invisible and that was the case at this hotel.[SEP]it's location is great.[SEP]it's rooms are old style but perfectly adequate.[SEP]it celebrates its connection to hawaiian culture and offers night time music and day time activities - all of which is great.[SEP]but it was the small things that made me feel unconnected.[SEP]arriving after midnight, there was no information about breakfast ; no help to get to the room ; no capacity to change the hawaiian greeting breakfast to another day as i had early starts for the first 2 days.[SEP]it was fine but felt lonely.
1	could use alot of improvement many years ago i used to stay here on fairly regular basis.[SEP]some things never change... like a great location.[SEP]otherwise, since the place was taken over by a new owner, who doesn't seem the least bit interested in puting any money into the place it has deteriorated noticably.[SEP]i just completed by most recent stay today.[SEP]first when you check in the smell of curry from the resident manager / owners kitchen is overwhelming.[SEP]the room is self was ok, but simply that.[SEP]it was in many respects kinda rundown and shabby.[SEP]the exterior is awfull and has not been painted in at least 20 years.[SEP]the walls are paper thin and you can hear ever detail of what is being said, or done the the rooms next to you.[SEP]now i read one of the reviews hear that talked about hookers hanging around the place.[SEP]well roberts is kinda dumby i've never seen a hooker around this hotel and this area and i know it very well.[SEP]if possible you money could be better spent elsewhere.[SEP]if you can't find anything else, as was the case with me, you can stay here for a night in acceptable comfort.
1	stayed for 3 nights in a city harbour view room.[SEP]donâ€ ™ t be expecting the view shown on the website with this category of room.[SEP]i had to lean over the railing and look to the left to see the opera house.[SEP]loved the balcony and would of loved to sit out there but the seat cushions were soiled and the table was less than clean.[SEP]the room itself was ok.[SEP]loved all the shelves.[SEP]the lights in them do make the top surface warm so watch what you place on them.[SEP]the automatic curtains would not close all the way.[SEP]the light wood is pleasant but it shows every mar and scuff.[SEP]the bed was one of the most uncomfortable i have experienced.[SEP]i think the pillow topper was missing as it was very firm.[SEP]even our friends that came to our room made mention of it so i knew it was not just us.[SEP]the bedside clock did not have a light so you could not tell the time after dark.[SEP]huge bathroom with great amenities.[SEP]slight mildew issue at the base of one of the glass walls in the shower.[SEP]toilet seat opening is quite large so beware.[SEP]some of the tv channels came in less than focused.[SEP]wonderful closet.[SEP]common areas were good with the exception of the area near the bar that smelled of stale smoke.[SEP]the staff are beyond wonderful![SEP]they are some of the best i have ever encountered.[SEP]they along with the location are what make this hotel.[SEP]if you put the building anywhere else it would not command such a price.
1	what a fantastic hotel.[SEP]the rooms are spacious for paris standards, very comfortable beds, luxurious roomy marble bathroom with hermes products.[SEP]the staff is courteous and very helpful and attentive.[SEP](provided guest umbrellas at the front door while raining).[SEP]the location is unbeatable: steps from famous rue saint honore close to all the high end shops and hip bars (buddha bar across the street).steps to place de la concorde and the famous hotel crillon and walking distance to madeleine, champs elysees etc.[SEP]also as the american embassy in on the corner and the street is closed to traffic which makes it very quiet and secure.[SEP]if you want to stay in paris and make the most of it, this is you hotel.
1	this hotel (not a spa) will be fantastic when finished, but that seems a long way off.[SEP]the facilities were not as advertised in our travel brochure and left our party of 10 quite disappointed.[SEP]no spa for the mums, no games room for the teenagers and the pool and it's surrounding area is quite small for the size of the resort.[SEP]the reception staff are very business like and in short supply.[SEP]however, the rooms were perfect.[SEP]plenty of room and, even though the even numbered rooms face the building work, we had a great view of the fireworks every evening.[SEP]the odd numbered rooms get the sunshine on their balconies all afternoon.[SEP]in a great location for the lake buena vista outlet, you just walk across the car park, and the walmart is only over the 535.[SEP]once completed i think this would be the perfect place to stay, but that appears to be some time off yet.
1	our group had three separate rooms and all were clean and spacious with en suite baths.[SEP]the location was great.[SEP]we were able to wonder around the trevi fountain each evening, take public transport from piazza barberini, which was a block away, and grab something to eat from the many resturants within the area of the hotel and the trevi.[SEP]the staff was amazing, able to converse in english with us, answering our many questions and offering great suggestions for activitities.[SEP]will stay here again on our next visit to rome!
1	our stay for four days at this lovely property was really a surprise package.[SEP]a fine location at the arc and easy access to the champs elysess gave us a perfect opportunity to experience french architecture as well as culture thru their wide boulevards.[SEP]the hotel was comfortable and our room was spacious with a large bathroom which was perfect for our family of four.[SEP]the staff was extremely courteous and helpful especially mr.[SEP]farooq at the concierge.[SEP]the breakfast buffet was generous with all kinds of cheese cereals cold cuts, breads eggs, fruits etc etc.... name it, it was there.... infact, the hotel took care of all our needs, including booking the lido show for us at the nth hour.[SEP]right outside the hotel was the rer subway station which was a bonus all kinds of travel tours moved outside our hotel including the air france airport bus which stopped at our doorstep.[SEP]great location with loads of restaurants, bars and cafes.[SEP]spoilt for choice.[SEP]to sum it all, we had a memorable stay and will return for sure.
1	great place, quiet room, very clean, great service.[SEP]we came early morning with 22 months daughter after 27 hrs flight from europe.[SEP]we got room shortly after 8 am, with no worries.[SEP]thank you very much for that!!!.[SEP]very good location, close to all major stations, walking distance to the quay, opera house and all major ferries.[SEP]surely if we come back one day to sydney we'll stay again at rydges ws.[SEP]mateo
1	after having read reviews here (mostly the negative ones) i must say that we were in for a really pleasant surprise![SEP]we felt very welcome at once - the staff ; doorman - receptionists - concierges all were polite and welcoming at our arrival and during our whole stay (stayed for one week.) we had a prepaid " deluxe queen room with city view ".[SEP]a very nice room, clean, and stayed clean every day during our stay.[SEP]we asked for a room higt up, ad got one on floor 23.[SEP]ok wiew, no traffic noise.[SEP]lovely breakfast restaurant.[SEP]- breakfast being served from 07.00 - 1130.[SEP]continental buffet was included in the prepaid price - (consisted of sliced fruits, bagels, croissants and assorted cakes (!!) cream cheese an jam / jelly.[SEP](a bit different an scarce compared to european hotel buffets, but any way..[SEP]it was ok) new york is a very expensive city.[SEP]so was the breakfast menu in our hotel (tried it once - 20 dollars for one portion of pancakes..). best location ever.
1	an absolute oasis of a hotel this was my second visit to the big apple, and we booked this hotel after reading reviews on the trip advisor.[SEP]we were not disappointed.[SEP]the hotel is small, extremely friendly, quiet and in the most wonderful location.[SEP]you are literally just steps from times square, but would never believe it as once you are in the hotel it is so quiet.[SEP]the rooms were spacious enough, the beds were extremely comfortable and everything was spotlessly clean.[SEP]the complimentary breakfast is more than adequate and the wine and cheese in the evenings is just unbelieveable.[SEP]there is even an internet connected computer complete with printer and paper in the lounge for free use.[SEP]an added bonus is the italian restaurant next door called tony's.[SEP]amazing food, amazing atmosphere and a great bar.[SEP]just up the road a bit is a lovely irish bar and a few yards after that a belgian bar which became our local.[SEP]when i go back, i will definitely be heading for the casablanca again.
1	smart little business hotel in an incredibly convenient location, minutes away from most of downtown boston.[SEP]friendly service, lots of nice touches (nice lounge with computers, wifi throughout, bottled water for free).[SEP]the room was tastefully designed and impecably clean.[SEP]wonderful place, and great value for central boston.[SEP]well done club quarters!
1	we lived in number one tower suites in dubai for 6 nights.[SEP]the hotel is clean in general, the lobby is small, the room was ok regarding space (that ’s the standard suite) there are bigger suites with 2 rooms and a small living rooms, there is a small kitchen with all the basic stuff that you might need but they are not very clean.[SEP]the breakfast was nice with reasonable varieties, and although there is no egg corner you can ask for any type of egg cooking you like.[SEP]it has a good location in shik zaid road, with so many near by restaurants, the rooms do not have good sound isolation i mean you can sometimes hear the people when they talk out side your room or even if they move stuff in the flour abouve you, its not that annoying but it worth mentioning.[SEP]the staff were friendly and the room service will provide you with any thing like suing kit or slippers which i found very convenient because there is no carpet on the floor and its so cold to walk on with out a slipper.[SEP]there is a nice swimming pool and a gym.[SEP]so in general this hotel was ok.
1	we had no idea what location to choose in dallas however the meridien located just across the street from the galleria shopping centre was a great choice.[SEP]it was easily accessible on the i635 (the northern ring road), about 25 minutes ($40) in a cab from dfw airport and with easy routes by car into the centre of town and other attractions including the roads to fort worth.[SEP]rooms were excellent, very contemporary, roomy with nice big tv and sofa.[SEP]our only complaint was that we were located near the elevators and could here them whirring but with such bad jet lag i slept through it most of the time![SEP]you can pay a bit more to be further away from the lifts but they were not too much of a porblem, particularly as we paid only $80 per night including breakfast and use of the pool, gym and jacuzzi.[SEP]the breakfast selection was not huge, but was of great quality and very fresh.[SEP]all of the staff were so friendly we would highly recommend this hotel for excellent value contemporary hotel, business or pleasure.[SEP]you need a car to get around dallas, hertz has an office in the westin hotel just over the road and were cheap at $120 for 4 days.[SEP]the only issue is that the meridien has valet only parking at $20 a day, so park your car over the road in the galleria shopping centre for free![SEP]would highly recommend the oceanaire restaurant adjacent to the westin hotel.
1	newly refurbished about 6 months ago - beds are extremely comfy.[SEP]room is a litle small but served its purpose.[SEP]staff is extemely friendly and went overboard to make sure my 2 year old was comfortable.[SEP]called for towels at 2 am and got them in 3 minutes![SEP]location is great 2 blocks off fisherman's wharf - close enough to the action without being in the middle of it.[SEP]trader joe's and safeway are a block away for any necessities.[SEP]get the buffet breakfast included in your stay - great deal and delicious food.[SEP]knucles sports bar was perfect for lunch or late night snacks.[SEP]cable car pickup only about a block away.[SEP]would recommend to all.
1	the location is great.[SEP]the rooms & beds were good.[SEP]we enjoyed the two bath rooms, but the room and decor are a little tired.[SEP]general view was just okay, but sitting on one of the beds, we had a beautiful sliver view of the space needle.[SEP]the rate for our package was absolutely fantastic, which included tickets to the gauguin exhibit.[SEP]the staff was fine, but didn't seem especially happy to help us.[SEP]i would only choose this hotel again over one of the many great ones in seattle if the rate was right.
1	we were not disappointed![SEP]this is a clean and cosy hotel in a central and convenient location with staff who were at hand to assist in every possible way.[SEP]we stayed for three nights and enjoyed the continental breakfast every morning.[SEP]on the second morning, the demand for breakfast exhausted the fruit supply and on the next day, the attendant made certain that there was copious amounts available, particularly for my parents who find this an essential part of their diet.[SEP]the only downside is the noisy street at the front of the hotel, which is located opposite " chez george ", a lively pub from which the clientele spills into the tiny street in the wee hours of the morning.[SEP]much later, either a street sweeper or garbage truck rattles up the street with annoying reliability, from which we were fortunately able to return to sleep.[SEP]these did not spoil our stay nor our opinion of the hotel nor it's location.[SEP]as other writers have suggested, a courtyard room would probably be more secluded.[SEP]regardless, we would have no hesitation in recommending the hotel la perle as value for money, in a great location and with fabulous staff!
1	renaissance 57 is positioned as a boutique hotel choice in mid town new york.[SEP]the location is great, a few blocks away from the shops on 5th avenue.[SEP]the boutique concept though has not been executed that well.[SEP]the lobby is too dark and having 2 separate lifts (first one goes to the restaurant on the 2nd floor and then you change over to another lift to take you to the hotel floors).[SEP]the lifts are a mighty pain especially if you have lots of luggage.[SEP]the restaurant looked nice and seemed to be frequented by a hep clientele though i did not eat there.[SEP]the rooms are quite small (well it is new york after all) and i had a room without a view so nothing to great there.[SEP]being a renaissance the beds were very comfy and i had a good nights sleep without any disturbance from the street noise.[SEP]i would recommend this hotel for those visiting new york for leisure esp if you get it for less than $200/night
1	another overpriced, tightwad hotel, but ok minuses:1.[SEP]no microwave2.[SEP]no fridge (you need to ask for it)3.[SEP]no complementary breakfast4.[SEP]no free internet, wireless or otherwise![SEP]($15 a day for cable connection)5.[SEP]considering the above, hotel is way overpriced.[SEP]another typical pricey hotel that offers as little as possible.[SEP]meanwhile, your $70 motels offer all of these things.... 6.[SEP]$30 a day valet parking![SEP]if you don't know how / where to park in the city (it is not free anywhere), you have no choice!plusses:1.[SEP]great location, right at the french quarter, walking distance to many attractions and the convention center.[SEP]this is probably the main reason for the price.2. chances are, you'll get a nice view from your room3.[SEP]small rooms, but very clean, beds are nice, and shower is good4.[SEP]friendly and helpful staff -- very rare in a downtown hotel, probably a secondary reason for the price.[SEP]overall: travellers accustomed to typical motel amenities, especially breakfast and internet, need to brace themselves.[SEP]but the hotel is good for a comfortable stay within walking distance of many attractions in this beautiful city.
1	i love the w hotels, very expensive, never less than $500 a night but really wonderful.[SEP]i went to the location on union square in new york city and at first i was not too happy that i had a room on a low floor.[SEP]i know new york city very well, when you go there you want a room on the highest floor possible otherwise you ca nt sleep.[SEP]but this location has a small balcony facing union square on the fifth floor, i opened the huge window and had a great party with my friends.[SEP]sometime lower is better.
1	i hate chemical smells in hotels, and they all have them.[SEP]at least, i thought they did, until i stayed at the orchard garden hotel.[SEP]lots of hotels are lovely.[SEP]this one made me feel good too![SEP]the service was great, the amenities above average, and the bed was one of the most comfortable i've ever slept in.[SEP]no question, i'd stay here again in a heartbeat.[SEP]great location too.
1	we recently stayed at the hotel commonwealth with our 3 kids and had a terrific experience.[SEP]we had a large, beautiful room big enough for all of us: 2 boys on a pull out couch and baby in a pack n play they provided.[SEP]the heavy pull across curtain dividing the space was key so that we were able to enjoy our time in the room as our kids slept.[SEP]the king bed was gorgeous, really nice.[SEP]we have stayed here before and will be back because there just aren't that many hotels that make your stay with kids as easy as this.[SEP]we love the location as it's close to the city and perfect for running on or taking the kids to the esplanad.[SEP]the service was exceptional.[SEP]the restaurants in the hotel are great too: island creek is one of the best in boston, eastern standard is my favorite spot for a drink with my husband at the bar and the hawthorne is my new favorite loungey bar.[SEP]this place is a must try.[SEP]just go check it out.[SEP]this hotel does it right.[SEP]5 stars!
1	this is our second stay at this hilton resort and we were not dissappointed.[SEP]we exchanged our local timeshare points to obtain a full week here, and the accommodation is far superior to anything we could have obtained in south africa.[SEP]the location is great, as it is located adjacent to premium outlets at the end of international drive.[SEP]one can simply exit at the back gate to go to the shops.[SEP]we stayed for a full week in a 2 room condo with all amenities, and a view of the lake - the block had recently been refurbished, and was in tip - top shape.[SEP]staff were friendly etc.[SEP]also to note is that there is a large publix supermarket across the road, which is useful for self - catering, if required.[SEP]it helps to have a car, but one can also use the i - ride which stops right outside highly recommended!
1	my husband and i stayed here for an anniversary and enjoyed it immensely.[SEP]the location is a little far north, but there are plenty of wineries in calistoga to visit, and everything else was a car - ride away -- and worth it![SEP]our room was quiet and had nice modern amenities, the spa was well - done, and the fitness activities offered were above and beyond -- there were reformer classes and hikes.[SEP]the pool, bocce courts, and bicycles also added to the fun, and the bar area around solbar had a nice, modern laid - back vibe.[SEP]every single person working there was super friendly and easy to talk to, which was appreciated.[SEP]although, unfortunately, we did not eat dinner at solbar, we did eat breakfast there every morning and it was delicious, especially the lemon ricotta pancakes and the sol - pe.[SEP]we loved our visit and would love to come back!
1	my wife and stayed at the hotel de crillon for the second time from 9/13 - 9/17/2010.[SEP]we last stayed there in 2000 and were thoroughly impressed.[SEP]ten years later, many of the same hotel staff were still there, and still performing their duties with the utmost professionalism and, as the french might say, savoir faire.[SEP]our room wasn't ready at the hotel's check in time, but the clerk remedied that by sending us to the bar for complimentary champagne (whatever we wanted) and snacks.[SEP]when he returned an hour later, he took us to our room which he promised we would love and we did as it had a great view of the eiffel tower and the other sites.[SEP]the rest of our stay was great, and the concierge helped us out by figuring out how to ship some excess luggage back to the us as we stayed in france for almost a month.[SEP]and kevin the bar tender (he is the guy who receives the white rose from the actress in the crillon's lead - in on the website) should have been a stand - up comedian.[SEP]he kept the bar hopping every night.[SEP]bottom line: the location is great, the hotel is quiet and the staff very helpful and friendly.[SEP]it is expensive however, but so are other comparable hotels in other great cities.
1	when i saw the heading of dirtiest hotels in america, immediately the carter hotel came to mind, and i laughed when it was the first on the list.[SEP]we booked a bus tour through a montreal tour company, for a weekend trip to ny city.[SEP]the hotel's location was great, a few steps away from times square.[SEP]but that is all the hotel has to offer.[SEP]when we got there, we checked in, and as we were walking up to our room, we saw fellow travellers opening our door... we got a new room we brought our own sheets, and i showered with my flip flops on, as well, as never taking them off in the room.[SEP]there wasn't any shampoo, and the soap we were left, was that of the previous guest -- used.[SEP]sitting in the lobby, i felt like i was on a bad acid trip.[SEP]honestly for the price, i'm not sure you can't find much better in manhattan, but then again i havn't tried.[SEP]i'm sure the hotel was nice, the year it was built.
1	stayed in the chancellor at the start of a self booked fly drive on the west coast.[SEP]staff were friendly and very helpful.[SEP]room had a great shower, large walk - in wardrobe space and a comfy bed - just what was required.[SEP]we looked out over union square and powell / hyde cable car line.[SEP]location for shopping and chinatown was great - you could walk to both and for fishermans wharf / telegraph hill etc you could just jump on the cable car.[SEP]hotel had hot coffee / tea making facilities in reception area with cookies all day and muffins in the morning.[SEP]would stay again and have recommended to my parents who are doing a similar trip next year.
1	we had a super time at the tropicana during our 17 night stay to celebrate our wedding anniversary.[SEP]secured a good deal on the city view room in paradise tower by dealing directly with nicole marshall.[SEP]check in was super fast which was greatly appreciated after a long flight.[SEP]each and every day housekeeping was carried out with any complaints from us.[SEP]we both loved the size of the casino as it meant you got used to different slots and were able to find them again with ease.[SEP]this helped me manage a win of over $800 on a 1cent machine, a great start to our holiday.[SEP]the pool area was fantastic other than having to spend too much time seeking out a sun lounger that wasn't broken, i would guess that over 50% of them fall into that category.[SEP]one of our holiday highlights was seeing the gladys knight show which was truly memorable.[SEP]i was not impressed with the car rental company as the staff were quite ignorant and the prices were very poor value.[SEP]to make a car rental reservation i used the internet in my room and booked with avis who have a desk and collection point in excalibur saving over $200 on a 4 day rental.[SEP]to all the reviewers who complain about the location may i suggest they look at a location map prior to booking and if you don't want to be so far south on the strip go elsewhere.[SEP]our holiday finished with check out by probably the most helpful desk operator, gwen, we have encountered.[SEP]we will be back one day.
1	was a bit worried about what we were going to find for the price we paid but shouldn't have been.[SEP]great location good sized rooms right on the strip.[SEP]we used the flamingo pool a couple of days with no problems.[SEP]also parked right next to reception for free.[SEP]point about the noise is appropriate but it is vegas and for this price you can't really complain.
1	- good size room (queen bed) - very clean - walking distance to notre dame.[SEP]- in the middle of resturant and market area review: stayed 1 night at this hotel.[SEP]this was twoard the end of our one month trip.[SEP]started out in paris for 7 nights at a different hotel then made our way around the country back to paris for one more night.[SEP]it's a easy walk to this hotel from the metro (st - michel).[SEP]it's in a pedestrian area with many resturants and markets.[SEP]the hotel staff wasn't very friendly, but they where helpful.[SEP]the room was spacious, clean and had a nice view of the market area.[SEP]safe location.[SEP]fairly quiet being in such a busy, populated area.[SEP]good size bathroom very clean.[SEP]small service elevator.[SEP]quick walk to notre dame.[SEP]near the metro line that can take you to the louvre and orsay.[SEP]we walked it was about 15 mins.[SEP]directions: from paris gare lyon.[SEP]take line 1 (la defense) to chatlet.[SEP]from chatlet take line 4 (porte d'orleans) to st - michel.[SEP]from there it's a quick 8 min walk south - east from the station.
1	windsor court is the best hotel in new orleans, yet it has not reached the mark of a five star hotel.[SEP]the concierge, front desk, bell men, and restaurant waiters / waitresses exhibit true overall southern hospitality.[SEP]the layout of our full suite was very good (and comfortable) and the value was excellent.[SEP]the location was close to french quarter and local attractions, yet far enough to get some quite.[SEP]however, considering that it is the only hotel in new orleans with four mobile stars i was expecting some more details.[SEP]for example i was expecting higher quality bath towels, separate tub and shower, and higher quality toiletries (such as the molton brown that was used in the public restrooms).[SEP]accent pillows on sofas or on needs (as shown online) would have been a nicer touch.[SEP]overall we had a wonderful experience and would highly recommend this property to anyone.
1	needed somewhere to stay within the hollywood location.[SEP]this hotel was perfectly placed for any tourist activities.[SEP]staff at check in desk were great![SEP]checked us in early as we had arrived from a 14 hour flight.[SEP]didn't hear any noise from the bar or street.
1	me and my wife were only in london for one night, and were looking for a cheap hotel round kings cross that was nothing special, just a place that we could get some rest for the one night we were in london![SEP]we booked into the hotel swinton as it was only â£70 for a double room, and was in the area we were wanting.[SEP]the website of this hotel is very missleading, as it made it look very stylish and clean, but to be honest it is far from that![SEP]it is far from the worse hotel i have ever stayed in, and i am pretty open minded to some of teh stuff i read on here, but given the choice i would probably stay somewhere else next time![SEP]good points about the hotel are location (short walk to kings cross) and the breakfast was really good, but there are more bad points![SEP]the actual rooms themselves are not to bad, but our room was burning as there was a heater we could not turn off, which lead to an uncomfertable sleep at night![SEP]the real problem was the bathroom, which had a strong smell of [ -- ] and the lack of a chair in the bedroom (my wife had to put her make up on sitting on the bed with her pocket mirror).[SEP]anyone in london for one night and on a budget then this hotel does the job, but no chance i will stay in it again!
1	we just returned from our stay at campo de'fiori, and we can't say enough good things about the hotel.[SEP]you will be smitten from the minute you arrive along the tiny cobblestone street: the charming ivy climbing the front of the hotel building ; the scent of fresh roses and lilies in the lobby -- everything about the hotel is welcoming.[SEP]once inside, the rooms are perfectly appointed with a great mix of antique and modern.[SEP]the antique furniture and pale purple walls gives the room an almost gothic feel, along with the crystal chandelier hung over the bed.[SEP]we left our french doors open at night, with only the shutters closed to keep out any flying creatures, and it was absolutely quiet.[SEP]the bathroom is completely new and has contemporary large black matte tiles on the floor and walls, with a big glass shower with a rainshower head.[SEP]lovely.[SEP]actually, the thick but not overly soft oversized towels were our favorite -- usually in european hotels the towels are half the size.[SEP]hotel's location is perfect walking distance to the colosseum, pantheon, travestere(over the ponte sisto -- best spot for dinner), and piazza navorna.[SEP]the staff is incredibly helpful and will assist with just about anything.[SEP]i would not hesitate to recommend the hotel campo de'fiori and will absolutely stay here again.[SEP]don't miss cappucino at sant’eustachio coffee bar a few blocks away -- it's the best of all the delicious italian coffee bars -- just ask at the desk and they'll draw you a map!
1	we just returned from paris and had a great stay at the royal magda etoile hotel.[SEP]we are a family with 2 small children and booked the suite deluxe.[SEP]the room looked exactly like the pictures online and was nice and clean.[SEP]maybe not the fanciest room, but it had everything we needed and was a real paris experience!![SEP]you can't beat the location near l'arc de triomphe and champs elysees.[SEP]easy metro stop just a block away.[SEP]the staff speaks excellent english and was very helpful during our stay.[SEP]great choice for a budget friendly paris hotel!!!
1	hi just recently stayed at the bentley, sept 6th-10th.[SEP]the hotel downstairs was very clean and airy, and free coffee in lobby, nice touch.[SEP]bedrooms- we stayed on the 18th floor, and the views were excellent, but the room could do with a refurb in my opinion.[SEP]not enough hanging space also.[SEP]staff very nice and friendly, and the location in my opinion was very good, a 15 minute walk to central park and fifth avenue, away from all the hustle and bustle.[SEP]did not hear a thing from the gas station or animal hospital, air conditioning was noisy, just take ear plugs.
1	i ve stayed at aventura mexicana for a week.[SEP]i highly recommend this hotel for the traveler that is thinking on: good prize, good location and good service.[SEP]the staff is great and very helpful.[SEP]the service was ok for the prize.[SEP]the location was great: close to the beach and close to the main st.[SEP]while i was there the hotel had a deal with a beach club which was great because they also had good quality service and the restaurant had convenient prizes as well.
1	i have stayed at the roosevelt three times.[SEP]each time, i found it to be a good, affordable option when visiting new york.[SEP]the roosevelt is not a high - end luxury hotel.[SEP]nor is it a typical chain hotel.[SEP]but, the rooms are clean and generally well - kept.[SEP]for touring manhattan, the location is great.[SEP]it is a short walk to a number of sites and is close to grand central station for public transportation.
1	asmali - a - smelly.[SEP]the bathroom had an unpleasant odour and not from our occupation of it.[SEP]my wife describes it as a musty or damp smell.[SEP]i think that's being generous.[SEP]not sure but there may also have been bedbugs.[SEP]great location though.[SEP]just around the corner from the blue mosque and aya sofya.[SEP]aircon was a plus.[SEP]wifi in the room and friendly staff also took the edge off the dissatisfaction with the bathroom.[SEP]we would stay elsewhere next time.
1	the location is great: 2 subway stops both less than 3 blocks away.[SEP]there are coffee shops and restaurants in abundance around the hotel.[SEP]the hotel room itself was very clean and comfortable, though yes, it is a lot smaller than what typical american hotel rooms are like.[SEP]this hotel is small and remniscient of a european hotel.[SEP]however, you're in new york city so you're not supposed to be spending a lot of time in your hotel room.[SEP]the staff was very helpful.[SEP]there was not an in - room iron, but we asked and one was delivered to our room immediately.[SEP]we also left our bags after check - out and they were securely stored so that we could retrieve them later in the day and continue sightseeing without the hassle of our luggage.
1	it's a great stopover hotel, clean and spacious.[SEP]i've stayed for both work and pleasure and the staff is very good.[SEP]breakfast is your typical springhill suites and always fresh.[SEP]i like the patio outside and the pool has always been clean and warm.[SEP]the only missing item in the pool area is a hot tub.[SEP]rooms are clean, bed comfortable.[SEP]the bathroom & shower area well designed using available space.[SEP]internet and wifi is the only issue being slow.[SEP]location is easy access to food and other central florida destinations.
1	this was my third butterfly hotel in hong kong in 3 weeks.[SEP]i must say i've been very lucky to start with the one on wellington, that was definitely the best at all levels.[SEP]at first, when i walked in my room at butterfly on hollywood road, i've felt very disappointed, almost shocked by the difference with the others.[SEP]i returned to the front desk to ask if they didn't have something less depressing.[SEP]the carpet didn't seem to be clean, it was all grey and brown and so small compared to the other rooms i had previously.[SEP]the staff has been very nice, they explained to me that this hotel was actually the oldest one and it would be renovated in a few weeks.[SEP]then they made me choose between 3 rooms and i picked the biggest with a nice view.[SEP]it was very quiet and i had a good sleep there, also appreciated the great location.[SEP]i like to go to life for lunch or dinner and it's near by.[SEP]just across the street, there is a nice restaurant and bar, in the end i thought the hotel was a good deal.
1	i lived in sydney for 4 years and never really had the chance to stay in a hotel over there.[SEP]when i got back there in june this year we stayed 3 nights in the observatory hotel.[SEP]i had has the spa day a few years ago and since then i was longing for staying there for a couple of nights.[SEP]we were upgraded to this fantastic suite with separate living, champagne and a personal card from the manager.[SEP]the decoration is classic and quite charming and i really liked the fact that i could open the windows and enjoy the fresh breeze and the view.[SEP]the breakfast is just perfect... great menu![SEP]staff is helpful and the location is good as well, just a few minutes away from the buzz of sydney's cbd.
1	really a good location, next to the british museum and buses and underground.[SEP]a clean friendly little hotel, very quiet and very good value.[SEP]it would not appeal to people who want tvs and modern bathrooms and the amenities of a regular american hotel.[SEP]there is a kettle in the bedroom with tea and instant coffee supplied.[SEP]breakfast in included in the price.[SEP]i have stayed here several times and will return again.
1	i originally stayed at this hotel in 2007 and returned for a 4 night stay in early december 2010.[SEP]i chose this hotel for the location and it really is awesome![SEP]in the middle of hollywood, everything is nearby with close access to the metro (train and bus) and a hertz office on - site.[SEP]i found the service to be great and the restaurant staff to be excellent (as was the food).[SEP]i stayed my two teenage sons (17 & 19) and will do so again when we next visit la.
1	a friend and i stayed at domus australia for our last two nights in rome.[SEP]the facility is excellent when you consider the cost of motels in rome and the size of the rooms in some of the 3 and 4 star hotels.[SEP]the facility is all new with large rooms and bathrooms.[SEP]everything is of a high standard.[SEP]the staff are very helpful and friendly.[SEP]the location is near termini station but i would not walk with a suit case.[SEP]i still think you would need to get a taxi.[SEP]i have stayed in other religious facilities in rome which are closer to the historic sites where you can walk to almost all the historicand tourist attaractions but a taxi from domus to the vactican only cost about 20 euro.[SEP]i would stay here again depending on my reasons for being in rome and to simply to re - charge the batteries in a modern, clean and safe accommodation before flying home.[SEP]the staff organised a car transfer to the airport for us which was reasonably priced for two people and saved the hassle with travelling by train to the airport.[SEP]overall a great place to stay.
1	stayed in this hotel between 17th - 22nd feb2011 (while we went to the daytona 500) and were really impressed.[SEP]i have stayed in hotels in florida costing far more and this hotel tops the lot.[SEP]very very clean.[SEP]excellent house keeping, all public areas clean, tidy.[SEP]only critism is the free breakfast is a little restricted in choice, but nothing that could not be overcome.[SEP]location is handy if you fancy a little stroll on a night into local shopping area/ funfare all very nice.
1	great location!!!![SEP]you are so close to times square!!![SEP]we ended up at this hotel last minute after the hotel we were supposed to say at was overbooked.[SEP]they booked us in a smoking room instead of a nonsmokeing but when we got there they gave us an upgrade to a suite because of their mixup!![SEP]the room was very nice, just as large as a 1 bedroom appartment would be![SEP]the hotel is outdated but that just adds to the charm.[SEP]the lobby was always full of people but that is nyc life:) i would stay here again if i could get a great deal like i did since it is a little over priced and paying for parking was a nightmare!
1	surprisingly nice, well located small hotel on broadway with reasonable rates.[SEP]nice little lobby with couches and chairs, connections for computers, etc.[SEP]our room was small by some chain standards, but very clean.[SEP]it contained a desk with chair & a chest of drawers.[SEP]a microwave oven, refrig, and coffeemaker were provided.[SEP]also a / c, an iron, ironing board, hair dryer and nice toiletries in the bathroom.[SEP]considering the price, we could not have beaten this location.[SEP]right outside the door are small zagat rated restaurants, markets, a drug store on the corner and a subway stop half a block away.' city tour' buses also had a stop less than a block away.[SEP]the desk clerks were friendly and helpful.[SEP]bellhop was available to help with baggage.[SEP]the only downside was the small elevator ; very slow.
1	i stayed here for an extra night in london at the end of a business trip, on the advice of an eyewitness guide.[SEP]the location is great- around the corner from the south kensington tube.[SEP]but the hotel was not much better than a hostel.[SEP]the bathroom was tiny and the door would not stay open.[SEP]the toilet barely worked ; the shower was in need of repair.[SEP]there is nowhere to have breakfast- they bring it to your room.[SEP]and the staff is very rude- asking for directions prompted rolled eyes and snarky comments.
1	excellent hotel throughout.[SEP]fast and friendly service from the moment we walked in to the moment we left.[SEP]i've stayed at many wonderful hotels in downtown indianapolis and this one is my favorite![SEP]convenient location to shopping, sporting events and restaurants.[SEP]the room we had was wonderful and the bed was very comfortable.[SEP]i would definitely stay at this hotel again.
1	great location, you can walk to the trolley to go anywhere in san diego, or eat at excellent reastaurants that are very close to walk to.[SEP]the hotel is a great bargain for the price.[SEP]use the $10 per day parking for your car.[SEP]you ca nt park on the street for any period of time without a ticket.[SEP]you do nt need a car to enjoy this city.[SEP]the rooms are small and adequate, nothing special, but fine.[SEP]the staff is cordial and helpful.[SEP]the lobby dog, penny, is the best.[SEP]call for the best price.
1	the merulana inn is in an excellent location for the price we paid being only a 10 minute walk to the colosseum / forum and approx 45 min walk through the city to the vatican.[SEP]the room was modern and clean and the staff were helpful and accomodating.[SEP]one of the staff members only spoke italian so we had a real language barrier but she overcame this by demonstrating what we needed to know, ie.[SEP]showing us which doors our pass would work on and where we could find information in english, etc.[SEP]they also provided us with an a3 size map of the city detailing all the tourist attractions which made navigating through rome extremely easy.[SEP]there was a pc with internet access that guests were allowed to use which made checking metro routes and bus times very easy however we found no need to use these in the end as everywhere was so closely located.[SEP]the room was cleaned each day to a high standard.[SEP]breakfast is available from 8 - 10 am and wasn't as varied as we would have liked but still had food to appeal to all tastes such as cereal, toast, yoghurts, pastries and meat slices.[SEP]i would happily stay here again if the opportunity arises to revisit rome.
1	the location is wonderful, the staff helpful.[SEP]they made recommendations for restaurants, called in our reservations, and made suggestions regarding places to see and do.[SEP](the jazz clubs are outstanding, but not as plentiful as we expected.)we had a rear - facing room and would have preferred a street - facing room, but the hotel was fully booked and it worked out well.[SEP]the hotel is on a relatively quiet street between boul.[SEP]st.[SEP]germaine and the college de france.[SEP]we have stayed in other hotels in this area, but would return to this one.[SEP]the breakfast was ample and fresh and the staff (desk, kitchen and housekeeping) extremely courteous and friendly.[SEP]there is a laptop on the first floor for free use.[SEP]the rooms were clean and of decent size.[SEP]we could have used more space for our clothing and luggage.[SEP]the bath was sufficiently large and very clean.[SEP]we highly recommend this hotel.
1	hi had a nice stay, the area was awesome..[SEP]we are on the beach, walking distane to all needs and beatiful towns close by..[SEP]the rooms were clean and the staff was super friendly.[SEP]i stayed for 5 days with my 14 yerar old daughter and we loved san diego..[SEP]my day was simple i woke up went to the gym which was a 2 minute walk not part of hotel but they gave me a 3 day comp pass..[SEP]then we had breakfast which was a 1 minute walk..[SEP]lol.[SEP]then took rental car and just drove to la jolla, laguna beach, cordona, down town san diego..[SEP]and if we did nt have a plan at the moment then we just drove around... the sunset was unbelievable watch it from a different location each night for different scenery for pictures..[SEP]one of the nights we watched from our best western room on our bacony..[SEP]we used enterprise rental and jet blue..[SEP]hope this helped someone..[SEP]have fun.
1	i would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again.[SEP]this is a very friendly staff and will make your trip very enjoyable and affordable.[SEP]the continental breakfast was perfect each morning and a great way to start the day.[SEP]from the front desk staff to the exceptional shuttle drivers, z, mike and shane.[SEP]this location is great, a short walk to the convention center.
1	we booked our stay at the hollywood celebrity after reading mixed reviews on trip advisor.[SEP]however this place was great for the price and anyone who rates this place badly is obviously hard to please![SEP]the room: big spacious rooms, great air conditioning, seperate bathroom area with shower over bath, wardrobe and dressing area, kitchen area with table, microwave, fridge / freezer and kettle.[SEP]the service: computer with unlimited free internet access provided in the lobby, staff very helpful about locations around la, free parking area (although admittedly this was small, however we always managed to find a space and when the car park is full the staff will show you to somewhere else nearby you may also park for free.[SEP]the breakfast: great selection of muffins, bagels, croissants, juices etc.[SEP]although only two chairs downstairs so we took plates etc up to the room and had breakfast at our table.[SEP]location: right behind the hollywood and highland mall on orchid avenue.[SEP]you can walk through the mall to be straight on hollywood blvd.[SEP]great hotel for the price, a tad grubby on the outside but more than made up for on the inside![SEP]has a nice patio area, also has a small fitness centre ad spa (however we never used these).[SEP]there was no pool, but this was nt a problem as we were later going to santa monica!
1	i originally wrote a review for this hotel, when i came back in october 2008 ; but it never seemed to appear?![SEP]but i felt i had to write something.[SEP]i arrived with my boyfriend for a 5 night stay and was given room 2221 with a view of the chrysler building since we were celebrating my birthday whilst in new york.[SEP]a complimentary chocolate birthday cake was brought up on the day and it was a lovely touch.[SEP]rooms: can't fault at all.[SEP]spacious, bed to die for and crisp, clean white linen.[SEP]bose surround system.[SEP]lovely turn down service at night.[SEP]nice range of french toiletries.[SEP]fresh orchid in the bathroom too.[SEP]service: nice reception staff, cancelled a reservation on my behalf for me.[SEP]helpful and courteous.[SEP]polite doormen too.[SEP]room service was on time and the food was good.[SEP]the price is what you would expect in a luxury city hotel.[SEP]location: superb.[SEP]within walking distance of times square, grand central terminal, 5th avenue.[SEP]being in the location it was, i was never woken up with street noise at all.[SEP]the lobby has free internet access on computers which is a good service, but can we quite busy at times.[SEP]overall, i can't fault this hotel.[SEP]i still rave about it since i'm back and would definitely book again on my return to new york.
1	i searched the internet for several hours.[SEP]the reviews for this hotel were very good and the price was competitive, so i crossed my fingers and made reservations.[SEP]first, the location could not be better.[SEP]we were a half block from times square, 2 1/2 blocks from our theater (phantom of the opera), and in the middle of all the places we wanted to go.[SEP]when we arrived we found the desk personnel very pleasant, but even more importantly competent, professional and helpful.[SEP]the lobby is small but quite adequate and clean.[SEP]upon entering our room, king - size bed, we were further pleased.[SEP]while the room was small it was very functionally laid out.[SEP]the decor from bedspread to paint on the walls was pleasant.[SEP]flat screen tv.[SEP]great shower with lots of hot water.[SEP]very importantly, everything was clean, clean, clean.[SEP]we used the two computers and printer just off the lobby for which there was no charge.[SEP]the breakfast was included and was more than adequate and the service personnel were again helpful and pleasant.[SEP]etc, etc, etc... we would go back again!
1	we stay here several times a year... even tho they are renovating, it was still the best around.[SEP]the staff is always accomodating and by nyc standards the rooms are always well appointed.... not big but again, it is new york.[SEP]a great starter breakfast and the location is terrific.....[SEP]close to everything, easy cab service and bus or subway nearby... nice little coffee haus downstairs.[SEP]many foreign guests... they know value and quality.[SEP]for the price.....[SEP]cannot be beat in a location parallel.
1	my husband and i travelled with my parents.[SEP]we had a standard room and they had a " superior " and the added price was evident, although the standard wasn't bad.[SEP]superior room had a much nicer bathroom.[SEP]the decor of the standard room was pretty dated, but both rooms were quiet and clean.[SEP]can't beat the location for the price, just steps from the eiffel tower, a major metro stop (école militaire) and with a little grocery store just next door.[SEP]good value for the money and the air conditionning works great... especially appreciated during the july heat wave![SEP]the breakfast included was pretty good, lots of choices.[SEP]hotel staff could have been a little friendlier, but they were fine.[SEP]2 computers available for internet use and the standard room doesn't have a fridge but the superior room does.
1	stayed at this hotel for one week while in boston for a work conference.[SEP]it was conveniently located near the government center, fanueil hall, boston commons - all walking distance.[SEP]several subway (t stop) stations nearby.[SEP]great location.[SEP]rooms were remodeled, on the smaller side - but with great historic charm.[SEP]service was higher than other hotels.
1	stayed for 4 nights 23rd july 2007.we are a family of four with two children 10 and 6 years.[SEP]this is a brilliant hotel.[SEP]the location is excellent and the view from our room on the 15th floor was breathtaking.[SEP]the mall underneath the hotel is perfect for eating and shopping.[SEP]you could not be any closer to where the stars all left their mark on the walk of fame.[SEP]as for the hotel, the staff were very welcoming and polite.[SEP]the swimming pool is excellent for a cooling dip in the la heat.[SEP]also the views aren't bad!![SEP]stay here if you are stopping in la for any time whatsoever, whether for one night or a week..[SEP]eat your breakfast at johnny rockets in the shopping mall.[SEP]there is a great diner over the road from hollywood boulevard called' mels diner' eat there, fully recommended.[SEP]also do the starlines tour of the celebrity homes..[SEP]brilliant.[SEP]all in all we stayed 4 nights and were able to visit santa monica, rodeo drive and we drove to the malibu beach areas.[SEP]a dream stay to start our holiday.
1	to me the quality of a person shows when they engage with their elders.[SEP]if the wedgewood were a person they would have strong character.[SEP]this was an ideal location to bring my 78 year old mother on her first vacation in over 30 years.[SEP]she was treated like gold by the staff who worked very hard to ensure she had everything she needed.[SEP]the valet staff always welcomed her, remembered her walker before we had a chance to think of it, helped her in and out of doors.[SEP]we were both tickled by the hand written note and box of chocolates in our room upon arrival.[SEP]this classically decorated hotel thinks of everything from sound proofed glass on the windows overlooking the bustling robson square to warm cookies at bed time.[SEP]the views were great for people watching but easy enough to get out and about to robson street and see equally great people milling about.[SEP]the high tea was a highlight but don't forget the spa.[SEP]my spa treatments were incredible.[SEP]valet parking was a breeze and a deal for this city.[SEP]it is wheelchair accessible but the ramp is in the lounge, a minor inconvenience.[SEP]very helpful & professional staff.[SEP]i highly recommend this intimate hotel where service is the order of the day.
1	loved the bamboo - wanted to stay longer we stayed at the aqua bamboo for 4 nights in september and we loved it.[SEP]we booked a superior studio - and stayed in room 1106.[SEP]i've read recent reviews and while we appreciate the experience that other travellers may have had, our experience was flawless.[SEP]the rate for the room, considering its location is fantastic and central.[SEP]the hotel is one block away from the beach - we had 3 lanais - two facing the beach and one facing the mountains.[SEP]the furnishings in the room are new and contemporary.[SEP]the door locks were being upgraded while we were there - we stopped in during the day to find dust, but when we returned in the evening, the room was absolutely spotless.[SEP]the hotel was full, but during the time we stayed, there was no problem in finding lounges by the pool.[SEP]the rate included continental breakfast, which was plentiful.[SEP]the hotel also has free internet access.[SEP]every single member of staff gave us 5 star service.[SEP]we are experienced travellers and stayed in 5 star hotels during our trip.[SEP]we loved the bamboo and will return.
1	excellent location next door to the train station, professional and efficient staff.[SEP]walking toward st.[SEP]mark square through the cannaregio sestriere is fun and entertaining.[SEP]the hotel is furnished in typical venetian style, rooms are nice and pretty size comparing to other hotels.[SEP]large breakfast buffet with salty and sweet items.[SEP]price on line with venice hotels.
1	i very very rarely write reviews, but felt that this place offered such good services that i would make an exception.[SEP]we was celebrating our first anniversary, and this turned out to be a perfect place.[SEP]upon check in we was given our leis and upgraded to a sea view room without even asking.[SEP]the hotel only found out it was our anniversary upon check in when they asked us.[SEP]everything was really good from the front desk check in to the service we received from the concierge.[SEP]our room was spacious and was always clean.[SEP]on our first night we tried eating at spago.[SEP]the food was great, but my only minor complaint was that it took quite long for the food to come out considering the restaurant was only 2/3 full.[SEP]but this didn't tarnish my experience at the four seasons.[SEP]we also tried scuba diving for the first time, and as my wife is a non swimmer she was quite nervous.[SEP]our instructor (phil) picked up on this and held her hand throughout the whole dive.[SEP]to me this is a sign of someone who cares and gives top quality service.[SEP]we also tried a his and hers treatment at the spa, and i would say it was good.[SEP]the changing area had just about everything a person could need in terms of grooming.[SEP]i would also say, having driven around the island that this is the best location on maui.[SEP]overall, top hotel.[SEP]would definately come back.
1	we chose this hotel based on location (we had a 2 night stopover with early flight departure) and on the great reviews on this site.[SEP]our experience was underwhelming.[SEP]the lobby may be imposing but the check - in service was offhand.[SEP]i felt i was being a nuisance by making them do some work.[SEP]the room was ok.[SEP]beds were comfy, it had a coffee maker with starbucks coffee, the windows were completely soundproof so the kids could watch the planes land in complete silence![SEP]the bathroom was horrible.[SEP]perhaps we are spoiled by westins in australia but the beige wallpaper was peeling, the bath was so shallow only my 2 year old could use it, and they didn't even provide shower gel.[SEP]it felt like a budget motel.[SEP]on the plus side we had a good meal in the hotel restaurant and the pool was fine to burn off some energy, but on check out we missed 3 shuttle buses to the airport because no - one came to collect our bags for 30 mins although we called numerous times.[SEP]a disappointing stay, will try somewhere else on our next trip.
1	we booked our week via interval international using a trade from our " home resort " of swallowtail (hilton head island.) riverpoint is a classic timeshare.[SEP]it is a small, cozy resort -- not the glitzy mega - resorts that are now the trend.[SEP]as were some others, i was a bit apprehensive about riverpointe ; however, i was pleasantly surprised.[SEP]accomodations are mobile homes -- somewhat small, but clean and very effective as a " base " for exploring napa, all of wine country, and the coastal areas like point reyes.[SEP]location is great -- turn right and you are in downtown napa -- turn left and you are on the silverado trail.
1	we were there as part of a family event at the columbia club - and wish we had stayed in one of the other hotels that were options.[SEP]our room was a renovated one, but housekeeping missed cleaning the toilet - which was disgusting.[SEP]granted, the mess of it was not in your vision but it shows you that their cleaning is just superficial.[SEP]management was useless in resolving the situation.[SEP]upper level rooms / floors 8 and 9 have been renovated and are worth the price if you must stay here.[SEP]lower floor rooms are old and disgusting.[SEP]food is average, service in the restaurant is non - existent.[SEP]building is historic, lobby is beautiful.[SEP]location is great but so many other real hotels on monument circle (this is not a hotel - don't be misled by the fact that they rent rooms, there is no customer service and onsite managment has no authority to make decisions) - go to one of the other name hotels instead- you will be glad you did.
1	i had a fantastic time at this hotel.[SEP]the hotel was clean and very tastefully decorated.[SEP]the concierge maria was fabulous.[SEP]she helped us to book a great tour to visit some of the wineries that was excellent.[SEP]she recommended a small company that took out groups of four so that the tour had a private feel but was very reasonably priced.[SEP]she also recommended several great restaurants and each one that we went to exceeded our expectations.[SEP]the breakfast buffet while not extensive had just enough offerings to make it just right after a night of drinking and fine dining.[SEP]the wait staff at the restaurant was extremely friendly and attentive.[SEP]the chief chef was also very personable and took the time to answer questions about the menu.[SEP]don't miss the free tastings between 5 - 6pm.[SEP]they are a great start to the evening or a nice way to wind down a long day.[SEP]the location was great, several restaurants and sights were within walking distance.[SEP]i would definitely stay here again.
1	wow![SEP]we travel often for both business and leisure, and when a special birthday trip brought us to montreal, we chose the hotel gault.[SEP]what an excellent decision we made.[SEP]simply put, this is one of the two or three finest hotels i've ever been to, anywhere in the world.[SEP]and for it's price range, it's certainly # 1.[SEP]the closest comparison in terms of quality, location and service i can think of is the wonderful myhotel chelsea in london.[SEP]as other reviewers have stated, the property itself is gorgeous.[SEP]we were in a " terra " room and it certainly lived up to the amazing reviews.[SEP]another fantastic feature was the included breakfast, and we even had dinner at the property once.[SEP]the staff were universally wonderful.[SEP]polite, friendly, helpful, and patient with my embarrassingly bad french (i'm working on it).[SEP]while the location is great and central, especially for those looking to do some sight - seeing and " touristy " things, we spent the bulk of our time several metro stops away, easily accessible from the nearby station.[SEP]thank you, hotel gault, for being the cornerstone of a wonderful vacatino.
1	my wife and i stayed at the st giles off tottenham court road in mid november.[SEP]the location can not be beaten for access to oxford street, the west end and central london, being about 60 yards from centrepoint tower at the corner of oxford st/ tottenham ct/ charing cross.[SEP]the hotel looks a bit forbidding, being as it is a bit 1960's multi - storey brutalist architecture, but the lobby and bar downstairs are more welcoming.[SEP]when we arrived, the hotel was booking in a conference (i gather they do a lot, by the notice boards) but we were quickly booked in to our room on the 9th floor (the hotel has 11 floors) as other reviewers have noted, the rooms are small.[SEP]but then again, i've never syated in london for a reasonable price in a room that wasn't.[SEP]that said, the room was clean, in excellent condition, we had a view out over the city to the southwest, the bed was comfortable and the shower/ bathroom excellent (another common complaint in some london hotels) the bar downstairs (along with the restaurant) was modern, staff were friendly.[SEP]when we were leaving, the concierge (who was portuguese) very kindly carried our bags up the street, got us a taxi (at rush hour).[SEP]the room was cleaned well every afternoon while we were out.[SEP]tv in room could use more channels, it only has the basics.[SEP]however, overall, i would reccommend this hotel, ands will stay again.
1	we stayed for two nights in this hotel for our anniversary.[SEP]from the minute we arrived out of the taxi until we checked out, the staff were really friendly and willing to help in any way.[SEP]we arrived at 11 am and hadn't requested an early checkin, but they accomodated us with no hassles.[SEP]we stayed in a king hyde park room and although the view wasn't as great as we expected, the room made up for it.[SEP]the room was clean, the marble bathroom is lovely and the bed is super comfortable.[SEP]we had buffet breakfast included and found this to be a great addition as the food was great.[SEP]we also really enjoyed the high tea served in the lobby restaurant with a glass of moet![SEP]although this hotel is on the pricey side, the location and level of service is well worth it.[SEP]we would definately stay there again.
1	great location!!!![SEP]hotel is very close to the vatican city 5 minutes walking), chaffour express super market (exiting to the left, just a couple feet walking), and is in front of the bus stop.[SEP]they do not have an elevator, but a lady of the hotel brought our luggage to our room.[SEP]the same happened when we left the hotel.[SEP]we voluntary gave a tip.[SEP]i did not like they changed the sheets when asked the first time.[SEP]i guess they do it every four days and seemed did not change the blanket for the whole stay of 18 days.[SEP]the bathroom floor seemed to be cleaned every third day.[SEP]they did not leave enough shampoos and had to ask most of the time for shampoos for all of us (4).[SEP]rooms do not have fridges and they were nice and gave us ice when asked.[SEP]breakfast buffet is good, but exactly the same food every single day turned it to hate it.[SEP]staff very helpful and nice, two spoke english and one spanish fluently.[SEP]bad experience when the receptionist s called an unauthorized taxi cab to take us to the airport.[SEP]he did n’t have a taxi meter and a permit, he overcharged us for taking us to the airport.[SEP]when confronted over the phone, she was loud and not polite.[SEP]i think hotels in europe are much over paid compared to the u.s.
1	wonderful base in london having stayed in sofitels in france and liked their style and extremely comfortable beds we decided to try sofitel st james, and have just been back for the second time.[SEP]the location is superb for theatres, opera, upmarket shopping and art galleries yet just away from the main crowded areas, in a former bank on waterloo place overlooking pall mall and historic statues.[SEP]the largely french staff don't seem to mind the address and on both our visits have been friendly, welcoming and helpful.[SEP]if you arrive by car the concierge service offers valet parking (拢40 for 24 hours).[SEP]check in and out very efficient.[SEP]the style is quietly modern, black   chrome and glass feature strongly, the bedrooms and bathrooms offer everything you would expect with impeccable standards of cleaning.[SEP]minibar prices as usual are punitive, but we tend to avoid them anyway.[SEP]the bar and restaurant (brasserie roux) are undeniably expensive but of high quality and central london prices are high generally.[SEP]we shall be back.
1	i loved this hotel, everything about it, it had such an authentic classy feel, the lobby is stunning and the staff very nice.[SEP]the location is perfect just opposite the chinese theatre.[SEP]the hotel is a tourist attraction in itself.[SEP]the poolside bar is lovely, and at the weekend attracted the " it " crowd, but it was fun to see how the la lifestyle seems to be.[SEP]the rooms very clean and maid service excellent.[SEP]bathroom a little on the small side, and some aspects of the room, carpet for example could be doing with renewal.[SEP]internet connection 10 dollars for 24 hours.[SEP]the hotel restuarant was nice, lovely steak and the prix fixe menu for 40 dollars for 3 courses represented good value for money in comparision to other top class hotels in the area, in the bev wilshire for example this would hardly buy you lunch.[SEP]hotel is very near to metro station and the hollywood highland centre its ideally located.[SEP]i would definitely stay here again if need be, but i would nt be returning to la in a hurry, give me nyc anyday!
1	we recently stayed at the hilton in woodland hills and we were very pleased.[SEP]we drove in from fresno to attend the rose bowl, oregon vs.[SEP]ohio state.[SEP]it was easy to find and we chose it for its easy 20 mile straight shot to pasadena.[SEP]very nice accommodations, we had a great king room on the corner with a nice view of the hills and the price per night was really reasonable for the new year / rose bowl time frame.[SEP]woodland hills is a sweet little area just nw of hollywood and universal studios is very close.[SEP]the hilton location in woodland hills offered great places to eat nearby and a huge shopping center within walking distance.[SEP]woodland hills is clean and feels safe.[SEP]we will definitely come back here.
1	stayed 5 nights.[SEP]single room with a comfortable double bed.[SEP]bathroom was clean.[SEP]sufficient space for me, although a wide person might find the room awkward.[SEP]probably need to upgrade for two people.[SEP]caution: internet was 15bp / day.[SEP]breakfast was included and was very good.[SEP]i must say that the staff was polite and helpful.[SEP]location is great: one block from tube, plenty of food places of all types, and a quiet area.[SEP]pedestrian shopping mall across the street.
1	we spent two night's at the lenox.[SEP]it is an incredibly welcoming environment with the entire staff, front desk, doormen, maids, etc.[SEP]highly motivated in creating a warm and relaxing ambiance.[SEP]we stayed in a junior suite, which is a single corner room with two queen beds overlooking downtown boston.[SEP]in this case " suite " means single corner room with more square footage that a single room, but not huge.[SEP]the beds are very, very comfortable, the linen luxurious, the decor is refined but not stuffy.[SEP]there is a small refrigerator but no coffee maker due to fire codes for historic old buidlings.[SEP]peets coffee served complimentary in the lobby each morning.[SEP]free paper available upon request.[SEP]extremely quiet.[SEP]i would jump at the opportunity to stay here again.[SEP]great location as well.
1	so far this was the best hotel experience i've had in the world.[SEP]from the check in to the late check out, hotel 1000 definitely deserved the 5 stars.[SEP]my wife and i stayed here after booking their case of the mondays package.[SEP]we got an upgrade, free in room movie, unlimited valet, and breakfast at boka lounge.[SEP]the hotel staff were really friendly and helpful.[SEP]i felt as if i was in a really posh hotel from the attentiveness.[SEP]they even left a card with a plate of fruit, congratulating us on our babymoon.[SEP]i guess its since they saw that my wife was about to pop our little one out any day now.[SEP]out of all the amenities my wife loved the bathtub more than anything.[SEP]the rooms reminded me of hotel unique in sao paulo but a lot better.[SEP]good location and within walking distance to pikes place market.[SEP]i'd definitely stay here again.
1	this hotel was a great find.[SEP]the room was lovely, spotlessly clean with real attention to detail.[SEP]the hotel has a relaxed, comfortable, welcoming atmopshere and very quiet for such a central location.[SEP]it was easy to get to all the attractions and so easy to get to on the metro from gare du nord.[SEP]staff were very friendly and helpful.[SEP]although the breakfast may seem initially expensive, compared to everything else in paris it was worth doing for a couple of mornings.[SEP]good selection of food.[SEP]there is also a great bakery just around the corner.[SEP]we hope to stay again.
1	staff is not customer oriented.[SEP]the room is tiny, dirty and smelly.[SEP]you can hear when people talk in the other room.[SEP]breakfast is poor and elevator is ancient.[SEP]too expensive for what you get.[SEP]are we just paying for location?[SEP]not worth it.
1	the grand hyatt is situated one block from union square and within walking distance to many of san francisco's greatest attractions.[SEP]room was fine.[SEP]i was surprised that there was no desk in the room.[SEP]there was a small corner table where i had to work and plugging in the laptop was a bit difficult.[SEP]outlets were hard to find.[SEP]still, they had a great aaa rate and you can't beat the location.[SEP]perfect for leisure travel.[SEP]rooftop restaurant / lounge is worth checking out.[SEP]beautiful views of the city.
1	considering that this is one of the cheapest hotels you will find in the venice area, i want to start off by saying that in order to stay here, you have to expect to get what you pay for.[SEP]it is not a 3 or even a 2 star hotel, and i don't think they advertise it as one.[SEP]so go into it with your expectation being less than average, and i think you'll enjoy your time there.[SEP]the staff was somewhat abrupt, although were able to answer the questions we had -- most of the time though, we felt like we were bothering them when we needed something.[SEP]the location is very good which was the reason i had booked here in the first place -- and it is also lonely planet recommended -- although, they may need to reevaluate their recommendation.[SEP]overall i gave this stay an average rating.[SEP]i feel that since we booked a 1 star type property, and for way under $200 usd which is what most hotels in venice will cost, we got what we paid for![SEP]on another note, although venice is a beautiful place and one that i'm happy we visited... it was extremely touristy![SEP]very disappointing that the restaurants, and stores cater to tourist so much to the point that i wasn't sure if i was in the us eating, or in italy![SEP]if you are deciding whether or not to visit venice, just make sure you are prepared for a tourist experience.[SEP]if you aren't really into a packed tourist destination, i'd suggest somewhere else in italy!
1	springtime for nyc when i found out we were staying in times square, i was extremely concerned.[SEP]i am not big on tourist traps, and would have preferred to stay uptown.[SEP]but the marriott marquis was top notch.[SEP]check in was a breeze, and my room was immaculate and so quiet i forgot we were in nyc.my only real problem with this hotel is the location, as it is not really near anyplace, unless you plan on seeing shows, which we did not.[SEP]grabbing a bite to eat was sort of a problem, albeit a minor one, and cabs were extremely plentiful.[SEP]the bed was far more comfortable than i thought it would be, and the pillows seemed brand new.[SEP]we did have a little trouble with water finding its way from the shower to the bathroom floor, but otherwise felt completely comfortable moving around barefoot, which is my touchstone for cleanliness.
1	we have stayed in this hotel with my wife, during our weekend in paris.[SEP]i have chosen it for the walking distance to gare du nord plus a convenience of a metro station nearby.[SEP]after exploring the area we have also discovered how close it is to montmarte from there, also that there is a very fine wine shop almost opposite the hotel.[SEP]the rooms are very clean and modern, with glass - wall bathroom in the room.[SEP]although they are not big, there is enough space.[SEP]minibar in the room is not even that expensive, if you compare its prices with the prices of most of paris' brasseries:) staying there was a pleasure.[SEP]staff was helpful, breakfast was ok and the location excellent.[SEP]if you are after moderately priced hotel, where you can spend few nights on your break in paris, this should be your choice.
1	we stayed based on the positive reviews here and would have to say it's even better.[SEP]the location couldn't be better, in the heart of st.[SEP]germain, and the rooms are very tastefully appointed.[SEP]but the best thing for us was the service, which was more 5 star than 3 star, thanks to sanjay.[SEP]he is the most pleasant, effective, hard working concierge we've ever encountered, all of his recommendations were spot on and he went (way) out of his way to help us.[SEP]next time we go to paris, we'll stay wherever sanjay is working.
1	we stayed at the hollywood hotel for 4 nights after finding a great deal through bookit.com.[SEP]although the neighborhood surrounding the hotel was a little bit sketchy, the location itself was very convenient to hollywood attractions.[SEP]a metro station on the red line is just one block south of the hotel, and this line takes you out to universal studios (and the other attractions on hollywood blvd.). we paid $18 per night to park in a gated lot.[SEP]otherwise, we would have had to park on the street (which seemed a little risky).[SEP]the room was small but adequate, with a patio overlooking a fountain and courtyard.[SEP]the hotel had several amenities including a pool (no hot tub), sauna room, and exercise room.[SEP]a continental breakfast was provided with decent food selection.[SEP]the elevators were extremely slow, and our room happened to be across the hall from the elevator.[SEP]we were awakened in the night by boisterous guests (hence our lowered rating on sleep quality).[SEP]overall, though, we found this to be excellent quality for the price.
1	just returned from 3 night stay at the st james, was a bit worried because of some of the reviews but they were unfounded as hotel was great.[SEP]we stayed with our two grown up daughters and had two adjoining rooms on sixth floor.[SEP]fantastic location right on times sq, friendly staff, very clean and great maid service, good internet service in lounge.[SEP]furnishing/ decoration a bit tatty in places but then you do nt go to new york to spend time looking at that, no hair dryer or iron in room but you only have to ask at reception.[SEP]had no problem with noise at night or with the lifts although one is a bit slow.[SEP]as mentioned in other reviews great delis next door, perfect for breakfast.[SEP]overall very happy with choice and would definately stay again
1	we have stayed at a wide variety of hotels in the sultanahmet area of istanbul, so are well placed to compare them.[SEP]we found legend hotel to be a home away from home.[SEP]the staff were lovely, very friendly and helpful and the hotel had a relaxed, comfortable ambiance.[SEP]as we had a small child with us we were thoughtfully given a downstairs room with plenty of space.[SEP]the room was kept in good order by the maid service with clean sheets and towels as needed.[SEP]the staff were excellent in their care of the safety and well - being of the child.[SEP]the daytime staff led by ibrahim being particularly nice.[SEP]there is an attractive view of the sea and shipping from the breakfast room whilst downstairs is a garden area with seating and an internet cafe where joseph will give you a warm welcome.[SEP]the hotel location is ideal, being within very easy walking distance of all the major attractions hippodrome, blue mosque, grand bazaar etc.[SEP]there is a small supermarket opposite and a telephone shop next door as well as good and very reasonably priced local restaurants in the street.[SEP]this hotel would definitly be our choice for another stay in the area.
1	best kept secret in seattle![SEP]what a pleasant surprise, i was looking for something on a budget that had a great location near to city center, with a secure parking garage, well equiped business center, gym and located in a safe area.[SEP]bingo![SEP]it's no frills, but very comfortable and charming with a european flare.[SEP]the rooms were well equipped with kitchenettes, coffee maker, fridge with complementary bottled water, microwave w/ popcorn.[SEP](safeway market across the street) house keeping did a great job.[SEP]staff was helpful, the business center was the best i've seen - complementary -several hp computers with internet access, printers, fax, copiers - no waiting.[SEP]there's a great roof top deck with a panorama view of elliott bay and down town seattle- one of the only hotels in seattle to have a roof top deck.[SEP]great location![SEP]the mediterranean inn is just a short 5 - 10 minute walk to key arena, seattle center (space needle, monorail, museums etc.) it's in a cute part of town with an abundance of cafe's, bistros and shopping nearby, plus there's a starbucks adjacent to the hotel lobby.[SEP]to save $i booked with travelocity for $70.[SEP]per night, which was quite a bit less than booking with the hotel directly.[SEP]great value![SEP]i'll be back and recommend to others.
1	a great hotel to stay in for a sight seeing and shopping trip to paris.[SEP]as others have said the location is brilliant, less than fifty yards to the metro.[SEP]a large number of the main tourist sights are within easy walking distance.[SEP]the hotel was nicely understated but immaculately clean throughout.[SEP]she staff were excellent, very helpful and spoke fluent english, breakfast was good and lots of choice.[SEP]what was really fantastic was free wifi throughout the hotel, which makes a nice change from being ripped off by most hotels.[SEP]really good hotel and i'd happily go back.
1	we were on our honeymoon and it was my wife's first time in paris.[SEP]we found lelittre to be perfect: good location in montparnasse, close to the metro, busses and cafes.[SEP]the room was comfortable, the breakfast excellent and the bar a cozy spot to end each day.[SEP]but the best was the friendliness and courtesy of the staff and the impeccable service from the front desk to the waitstaff at breakfast to the bartenders.[SEP]one morning when i went to get coffee and juice to take back to the room, a waiter not only brought it to me, he insisted on placing on a tray, adding a copy of the international herald tribune, then carrying the tray up to the door of our room.[SEP]we will be back to paris and we will return to le littre.
1	my daughter and i stayed here for 4 nights, and found at all times that the staff were very friendly and helpful.[SEP]the concierge were always able to help with any directions, but the comfort of the rooms was the highlight for us.[SEP]the beds were the most comfortable hotel beds i have ever slept in, the rooms were an excellent size and the bathroom was amazing.[SEP]the little cupboard where we put our suitcases is great because it means that they are not in the way.[SEP]the location is just perfect and central in sydney for any shopping or sightseeing.[SEP]there is not one thing i have to complain about this hotel and would definately stay there again
1	the location is the main reason for recommending and writing this review, my husband and i visited paris with friends (another couple) one night, the guys went for a drink and we went to get ready for dinner, neither of us felt intimidated walking back to the hotel through the narrow streeets off avenue opera.[SEP]the metro stations are handy but walking lets you see more and you are only minutes from the louvre and the seine.[SEP]as mentioned the rooms are small but we found them sufficient, generally you are not in paris to sit in a hotel room.[SEP]they are clean and had everything we needed including a safe for any valuables.[SEP]it is worth eating breakfast in the hotel we tried finding a cafe outside and the quality and price weren't really worth the effort.[SEP]the hotel staff were friendly and very helpful.[SEP]the receptionist even apologised for the awful weather but being scottish we are used to that![SEP]we all thoroughly enjoyed our visit to this hotel and would highly recommend it to everyone.[SEP]in fact another friend has booked already![SEP]the hotel only has about 20 rooms so book it if you want a centrally located room at a reasonable price.[SEP]bon voyage!
1	besides the fact that you almost couldn't move in the rooms because of the size, the windows & doors were so thin that you could hear a fly fart outside... also, no elevator in the hotel, no minibar & phone in the room.[SEP]additionally to that, the warm water in the shower was just about enough for one person - without washing your hair... the location is really great though.[SEP]close to broadway, broome st, subway, great shops & bars.[SEP]so that was really nice.[SEP]all in all, i would pay such money again for such a mini - hotel.[SEP]rather spend a couple of bucks more, but have a nice room!
1	we booked the donatello because our timeshare company has a portion of rooms there.[SEP]the location just 2 blocks off union square is perfect to wander and sightsee in sf.[SEP]the room was clean, spacious and well appointed.[SEP]some details could have been updated but they were minor.[SEP]the small kitchenette was nice, frig / microwave / coffemaker and dishware to get us through leftovers or appetizers.[SEP]the breakfast / lounge area was nice, though we didn't have anything but coffee there.[SEP]nice outdoor deck and fireplace, we were the only people using the area.[SEP]desk staff was friendly and helpful, the bar upstairs was nice.[SEP]we didn't try the restaurant.[SEP]the only downside was our view of the rooftops behind the donatello.[SEP]we wished we'd asked for a street view.
1	the hotel is undergoing a renovation at the moment, the restaurant is being rebuilt, so maybe this review should be considered against future ones when the renovation is complete.[SEP]we arranged for transport from the airport and even though we were delayed quite a long time the driver patiently waited without fuss and there was no extra cost asked for, which was a nice touch.[SEP]the reception staff were always very pleasant and, as ever, spoke very good english - we really did make the effort to utter a few words in turkish but it was a pointless excercise.[SEP]the room was very basic and small but i must admit that generally we're not too bothered about things like that as it is only a place to rest your head.[SEP]even though we're not looking for sumptuous surroundings it would have been nice to have a decent shower / bathroom - i'm afraid ours was a bit grotty.[SEP]nevertheless, the hotel is in a great position, just 5 minutes walk from the blue mosque, haghia sophia and topkapi palace, and 20 minutes from the grand bazaar - an unbelievably great location.[SEP]just a word of warning![SEP]i had not been to a muslim country for a while and had forgotten the morning call to prayers.[SEP]can you imagine the noise at 5.30am from one of the most holiest churches of islam.[SEP]this goes on for about half an hour, you nod off and then at 8 am it's all happening again.[SEP]by then you're wide awake - no need for an early morning call in istanbul.
1	stayed for 4 nights as part of a holiday trip to usa.[SEP]good central location and nice comfortable rooms (we had a superior which was a good size for nyc).[SEP]the bathroom was good although the bath was small, as was the bed - a queen not a king.[SEP]we didn't eat at the hotel but did have a drink the the bar - a nice sit up bar though drinks were expensive.[SEP]breakfast wasn't included - we didn't have breakfast in the hotel as the price was $25![SEP]a fresh bagel and a coffee across the road was $6.[SEP]we ate at 4 of the top places in nyc - (check out the luxe guide - always excellent).[SEP]momofuku / sfoglia / tia pol / buddakhan - all were fantastic.[SEP]overall the hotel was very good and the room rate was decent value for nyc - a good solid choice.
1	we just returned from an anniversary trip to san francisco and stayed at hotel palomar.[SEP]i stressed over where to stay as we had never been to san francisco and i wanted this trip to be extra special.[SEP]given the hotel choices, this was no easy feat.[SEP]i knew as soon as i called to book my reservation that i had made the right choice.[SEP]the hotel concierge, lauren, offered to assist with all details related to our stay in san francisco.[SEP]lauren recommended restaurants, wineries to visit in napa and places to see in the city.[SEP]she made dinner reservations at some of the nicest restaurants and each dinner was topped off with a special treat from the chef wishing us a happy anniversary - thanks to lauren.[SEP]i can't say enough about her - she is awesome![SEP]my one regret is not getting to meet her during our stay.[SEP]however, she made sure that we were in good hands with daniel as he stepped in to ensure that everything went off without a hitch in her absence.[SEP]he even arranged a last minute car rental that met our exact specifications.[SEP]the staff was incredible and asked throughout the stay if our anniversary trip was going well.[SEP]even though the prompt was in the reservation system, it still meant a lot for them to do this every time we visited the front desk.[SEP]the hotel has the perfect location - close to the ferry building, powell street cable car turnabout and shopping.[SEP]i can't say enough about this place.[SEP]we will definitely return.
1	love the location.[SEP]as it is near good eating places and i enjoyed the hustle and bustle of the local area.[SEP]find that it is close enough to trams, mtr, buses.[SEP]i like the fact that it has a good tv system which allows me to even watch hd![SEP]see this link: http://tinyurl.com/ygxlg4n
1	found this hotel on tripadvisor and had high expectations.[SEP]of course it is not a five star or luxury hotel, it has four stars, but they are very well worth it!![SEP]good location (some noise from the traffic, so if that bothers you, ask for a room facing the back), excellent service both at reception and in the bar as well as the breakfast room.[SEP]for italy, an excellent breakfast buffet and possibilities to get espresso or cappuccino, too along with fresh fruit, various types of bread and cakes, bacon, scrambled eggs, veggies, salads, water, juices, cereals, cheeses and cold cuts.[SEP]minus for the fitted carpet in the room, but at least it was clean and not especially worn.[SEP]room was big, on the fourth floor, with balcony towards the street.[SEP]sofa and good desk provided ample space for work.[SEP]big and well equipped bathroom.[SEP]coffee / teatray with biscuits provided.[SEP]welcome from management with a bottle of decent red wine with nice wine glasses.[SEP]observed that one of us was celebrating birthday, got a fruit platter and a card, appreciated the gesture.[SEP]fridge and safe, of course.[SEP]a free water bottle daily.[SEP]lots of help from the reception.[SEP]used their car with driver to go to airport at only a few euros more than the fixed taxi fare, and much more convenient.[SEP]would absolutely not hesitate to go back to this hotel!!
1	we stayed at the fusion over new year's - this was the best spot on the beach in our opinion.[SEP]the location is great - the beach is clean.[SEP]the staff are very friendly and accommodating.[SEP]sergio was our server nearly every afternoon he was so kind and friendly![SEP]this hotel is beautiful and unique.[SEP]i love the courtyard type garden setting.[SEP]we had a room towards the back and had no problems with noise at night.[SEP]we felt like we were in our own little villa.[SEP]great atmosphere by day and by night - the food in the restaurant is excellent as well.[SEP]prices were very reasonable![SEP]love the house dog:) we will definitely come back!![SEP]thank you for a great family vacation!!
1	all good with this hilton.[SEP]we stayed at this hotel for a long weekend in feb 07.[SEP]we had flown into pisa airport and decided to hire a car for convenience.[SEP]the location of this hotel is very good if you are driving from pisa.[SEP]the hotel is very close to the first exit on pisa florence motorway and easy to find with the directions mentioned on the website.[SEP]the parking is free and plenty.[SEP]it is a bit out of town but the shuttle bus makes up for it.[SEP]also there is a bus from the city center to the hotel for 鈧?.5 or taxi for only 鈧?0.the rooms were clean, modern but a bit small.[SEP]not a big problem if you do not have to spend a lot of time in the room.[SEP]some members have mentioned previously about the bathroom with glass doors and looking into the bedroom through another glass panel.[SEP]this is true and must be considered if you are sharing the room with someone other than a partner.[SEP]the bar, the restaurant for breakfast and dinner served good food and staff was attentive.[SEP]all in all good 4star hotel.
1	just returned from six nights at le lavoisier, and had a great experience.[SEP]the location is outstanding.[SEP]yes, the rooms are small, but they are immaculate and very charming.[SEP]the staff went above and beyond the call of duty.[SEP]many thanks to fabienne and nisha.
1	we just returned from a trip to rome (end of october) with a week stay at this hotel.[SEP]i guess i might stay there again (very nice staff) ; however, some things to note: [ 1 ] although very close to the train station (about 5 blocks away), it was across a busy road (not what i would consider a " highway " as written in another post), and if you come at night, you better know what the hotel looks like since there are no signs that give its location ; [ 2 ] the internet is free (in 15 minute increments) ; however, you have to go down the street to an internet cafe to use it.[SEP]although it is on the way to the train station, it was quite inconvenient since you could only use it during their hours of operation, and you had to schedule your internet use around them ; and [ 3 ] the breakfast area was off site too.[SEP]across this busy intersection (especially during rush hour).[SEP]the price was great and the room clean.
1	wow!!![SEP]i can't believe i stayed in the same hotel as the other people who were so negative on this property!![SEP]it is a dated, five story, building.[SEP]my room was clean, non - smoking, didn't smell.[SEP]no coffee maker, no refrigerator, no breakfast, but near a denny's.[SEP]i happened to have cooler so that took care of the lack of a refrigerator.[SEP]they do have covered underground parking.[SEP]one computer in the lobby that has an internet connection with a printer at 40cents page, but there if you need it.[SEP]the people there were friendly, helpful with a desire to help.[SEP]so the service was acceptable.[SEP]i would have liked a breakfast, but knew there was none at booking.[SEP]the location is convenient to downtown and the airport and attractions, like balboa park and the cabrillo national park at loma point.[SEP]very near harbor blvd for the airport and downtown, and right off rosecranss street that connects to all the freeways just about five miles down roasecarns to i-8.[SEP]i wouldn't rush back to it, but it wasn't all that bad either.[SEP]if i needed to stay in san diego again i would consider the property, among others.
1	wasn't sure about location when i initially booked hotel, but now that we've stayed there i must say that it was spot on.[SEP]straight down the road (5min) to opera house.[SEP]around the corner (2min) circular quay, continue around circular quay to the rocks (10min).[SEP]walked through city to darlingharbour on one occassion to visit aquarium and wildlife world (20min walk).[SEP]glad we didn't stay in city centre it was way too busy.[SEP]being opposite botanical gardens and around circular quay made our time in sydney feel much more relaxed and leisurely.[SEP]the hotel itself is old world, as is obvious in the pictures.[SEP]not to my husbands taste, but all the same our room was huge.....[SEP]two double beds (travelled with two young children), couch, armchair, coffee table, desk.... plenty of room for the kids to play.[SEP]the bathroom was also large with separate shower and bath, but i must say it did feel more 4 star when it come to wear and tear.[SEP]for us it was all worth it considering we paid less then $200 a night.[SEP]compared to other hotel prices in this area it was an absolute bargain.
1	we were really happy with the place when we arrived, and the room was really nice (if not a tad smaller than we'd expected... but still ok).[SEP]2 nights into our stay though we arrived back from a night out to find our room stinking of... well... faeces![SEP]no other way to describe it![SEP]it took a bit of negotiations on the phone to reception to get them to change our room and also to upgrade us (we had to basically demand this, they were going to give us the same room on a lower floor - i don't think so!).[SEP]the reception staff weren't very friendly and really only give you the minimum required attention.[SEP]the location is really great though, you don't even have to leave the building to get to miracle mile - the shopping mall which was great.[SEP]it's got restaurants and a theatre as well.[SEP]a side note: i wouldn't bother again with the shopping outlets, they were a waste of time![SEP]also if you're australian you don't get the freebies on offer..[SEP]you're constantly approached by people trying to flog stuff or give stuff away, but whenever we said we were australians on our honeymoon the staff would just walk off![SEP]i also recommend the japanese restaurant in paris next door, it was great!
1	we stayed here 25 - 29 of december and found it was a relitavely decent hotel.[SEP]those who say it is in a dodgy area obviously have nt been to other places in asia- singapore is probably one of the cleanest areas, even little india![SEP]we found the location great, and just down the road from the very popular' wanderlust' so you can go to the restaurant there.[SEP]overall the reviews on this website are pretty correct, it is a small hotel room (not unusual for asia) but it is very well designed and compact, fitting everythign you pretty much need- unless you plan to do a lot of shopping in singapore![SEP]its pretty good for short stays, i wouldn't stay more than a week if space is a large issue.[SEP]the smell of the hotel definately is' signature' to the moon- it must be damp in the air conditioner or something.[SEP]you find this a lot in singapore because of the climate, but at the moon it seemed rather intense.[SEP]when we first booked in our room had no window, dissapointed as we had requested a window- we asked the helpful staff to change our room- and they did without a problem which was great.[SEP]the room we got changed to was a lot smaller but with a large window which was great.[SEP]the beds were amazingly comfortable, and the tv is fantastic.[SEP]wifi also a bonus![SEP]the free cocktails are a must![SEP]a great touch.[SEP]we did nt eat the breakfast as there are so many amaizng food options in singapore![SEP]the moon- not a bad choice.
1	stayed at paris for the first time april 24th thru 27th.[SEP]check in was very smooth & quick, received a red room on the 25th floor.[SEP]the room was very nice & clean.[SEP]it had a large flat screen tv, clock radio with a dock for your i - pod and a small refrigerator.[SEP]bathroom was nice in size and featured a tub and seperate stand up shower.[SEP]bed was very comfortable as well.[SEP]the location of this hotel is fantastic, just about the center of the strip.[SEP]one thing i really love about this place is the short walk from the elevator to the strip.[SEP]the pool area is actually located on the 3rd floor, it's decent in size with plenty of loungers to go around.[SEP]it's not one of the best pools in vegas, but it's fine by my standards.[SEP]the casino itself is easy to navigate thru and features some great restaurants.[SEP]the piano bar is alot of fun as well as the new chateau nightclub.[SEP]the eiffel tower is a must do, the view at the top is fantastic.[SEP]another plus about paris, it connects to ballys via an inside walk way that features shops and dining.[SEP]this was my 12th trip to vegas and i've stayed at mandalay bay, mgm, new york new york, mirage & t.i., paris will now be my hotel of choice.
1	great location, great hotel.[SEP]the gardenview hotel is situated in a lovely location beside the botanical gardens and zoo.[SEP]i found the staff to be friendly and accomodating.[SEP]our room was very clean and had a great view.[SEP]situated within 2 minutes walking distance to a victoria peak tram terminal and within walking distance to local shopping.[SEP]taxi's stop and wait for fares outside this hotel day and night and there was always one available when we stepped outside.[SEP]when not using the victoria peak tram, i advise the use of taxi's as the hill is very steep and a bit of an epic climb in the heat.
1	no free internet, but we paid 5 euro for 24 hours access, which is not too bad.[SEP]there is a free breakfast buffet that is decent.[SEP]rooms were fairly large by european standards.[SEP]the hotel also includes a tour to murano to see the glass blowing factory.[SEP]you get to see a demonstration, and then they try to sell you the glass work.[SEP]there's no pressure to buy the pieces, and it's a good chance to experience the water taxi ride (which is usually very expensive) for free (1-way).[SEP]just catch the water bus on the way back.[SEP]you can walk to everything from the hotel's central location.[SEP]we arrived via train to venice, then took the water bus through the grand canal from the train station to the hotel.[SEP]getting from the hotel to the airport took over an hour on the water bus, so budget plenty of time.
1	this was my third trip to vegas and i love this town.[SEP]i booked this hotel mainly because i have never stayed there before and i liked my fellow trip advisors reviews.[SEP]my buddy who was traveling with me lost his cellphone and everyone in the hotel went well beyond the call of duty in trying to locate it, which to me states a lot about the type of people working there.[SEP]below is a list of my pros and cons and you can make your own decisions.[SEP]i would definetly recommend staying if you can get a good deal.[SEP]pros: - super friendly staff, waitresses, dealers.... - security and personnel were extremely helpful in searching for my buddies phone - room price, $149 for 2 nights, not too shabby - location, walking distance to most strip casinos - free show, the sirens is a must see if you like women - lots of eye candy in the casino but that can be said for most vegas locales - most important - i won at the casino!!!!![SEP]cons - rooms were plain, no coffee maker, & not very cool (i can't complain much the outside temp was 109f) - food prices, seemed to be more pricey than the other comparable casinos - wanted to charge me $10 to print my boarding pass??[SEP]as the terminator said - i'll be back.
1	nice hotel nice hotel.[SEP]friendly check - in, very clean and well maintained rooms.[SEP]rooms are small, hotel is located in an old building which is nicely maintained.[SEP]there is complimentary business center, also a bar and restaurant.[SEP]complimentary refershments are located in the lobby in the afternoon.[SEP]location is excellent for touring the city.
1	stayed at the hyatt at olive 8 for 2 nights, family of 5 with 3 teen boys.[SEP]we booked 2 connecting rooms (1 king, 2 queens).[SEP]very modern and clean hotel, very friendly valet and check - in service.[SEP]spacious rooms, comfortable beds, spacious bathrooms.[SEP]ordered room service twice, very good food and service.[SEP]nice gym and lap pool.[SEP]will definitely try the hotel spa next time.[SEP]the only thing i found to be missing is a soda machine, but not timportant overall.[SEP]quiet room, didn't hear any other guests.[SEP]great location to the wonderful downtown shopping, coffee places, restaurants, very safe location.[SEP]we will definitely return to this hotel on our next visit to seattle, this hotel is highly recommended!!!
1	fantastic hotel.[SEP]fine attention to taste, design and details throughout.[SEP]excellent location, close to everything, yet slightly out of the crush of the tourist hubbub.[SEP]this means it is quiet and relaxing.[SEP]the employees went out of their way to help us in every way.[SEP]the owner is a masters swimmer, as am i, and she introduced me to her venetian swim club with which i trained.
1	little gem - great location this hotel is a proper gem in florence.[SEP]so easy to find and within very easy walking distance of just about all the major attractions (about 5 mins from train station, 10 mins from duomo), as well as loads of great trattoria, would stay here again without hesitation.[SEP]rooms aren't huge but are comfortable, immaculately clean and the staff are really friendly and helpful (all speak excellant english).breakfast in the bright breakfast room is basic but more than enough to start your day and the pastries are fresh and very tasty.[SEP]if you can, get a room on the back of the hotel, it's quieter and imagine my delight when i opened the shutters on our room and caught a glimpse (albeit through a tree) of the duomo and the campanile![SEP]it's not vital but is a small cherry on the cake.[SEP]hotel doesn't have it's own restaurant but the pasta house next door does a brisk trade and is perfect if you want a good quick meal (we managed to have a 2 course meal in 40 minutes which is almost unheard of in most restaurants in florence).[SEP]but don't mistake cheap with rubbish, the food here is surprisingly good and they are open till about 10:30.
1	charles river suite amazing!!![SEP]comfy bed and furniture.[SEP]my only strong complaint is the upholstery needs shampooing (smudges on legs of couches / chairs) and nicked bedside tables.[SEP]may be no big deal to many people, but at this price point, the entire suite should be impeccable.[SEP]hotel staff very friendly and knowledgeable.[SEP]so fun to make your own " pub crawl " between the lounges right in the building![SEP]location great for walking the city (especially if you know boston well) or interested in running around the charles.
1	i've been staying at this hotel for a little over 2 months now and have no issues to continue coming back.[SEP]the hotel is conveniently located in the hollywood and highlands area and you can walk from the hotel to the shopping and dining options next door.[SEP]this is a plus since i found the room service menu to be somewhat limited in terms of options that appealed to me.[SEP]rooms are clean and nicely finished and for the most part pretty quiet.[SEP]i'd avoid rooms near the elevators especially near the concierge lounge since that tends to have a lot of foot traffic.[SEP]the rooms are nicely sized, i wouldn't consider them to be spacious, but i've never felt cramped in them.[SEP]i only have a few minor annoyances with the hotel, first being that $29 to valet park overnight is really expensive and i don't know if i would spend that much if i had to pay out of pocket.[SEP]second, the key slot for the concierge floors in the elevator is too low.[SEP]third, the key slot outside the concierge lounge is too flaky, often involving 4 or more swipes to get it to work.[SEP]other than that, the hotel does tend to get overrun by conference groups on occasion, but that's just a sign that the hotel is popular and in a great location.
1	i stayed at allegro playacar from july 7 - 12.[SEP]it was a thoroughly enjoyable vacation.[SEP]i took the advice of another tripadvisor reviewer and upgraded to an oceanfront room - a definite must for $20 extra per day.[SEP]the food was great, the drinks fine, and the location terrific.[SEP]yes, there are geotubes in the water - but that is true for the whole coastline.[SEP]there are plenty of places to go swimming that are close by.[SEP]if you go, and i highly recommend you do - you will be impressed by the well - kept grounds and attentive staff.[SEP]once you make it clear to the time - share sharks you are not interested they will leave you alone.[SEP]if you need a 5 star experience, you'll have to pay 5 star prices, but for the money the allegro is great.[SEP]i'll definitely return!
