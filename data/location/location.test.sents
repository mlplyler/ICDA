0	we stayed at the dona palace for 3 nights and while the location is central, it is also more crowded and noisy.[SEP]the windows of the room we stayed in did not have adequate sound proofing, noise from the canal and outside would wake us up early in the morning.[SEP]the breakfast was a nice bonus though, the two waitresses serving the room were always gracious and helpful.[SEP]the front desk personnel however were rude and abrupt, so that wasn't pleasant to deal with.[SEP]the rooms are dated and had a musty smell.[SEP]the bed was uncomfortable, blankets were rough, and the shower drain did not work very well.[SEP]overall, i probably wound not stay here again.
0	not a great location... in amsterdam only book the best.[SEP]this place was full of tour group young people.[SEP]smoking everywhere.[SEP]smelt in room could nt have window open.[SEP]asked for extra pillow told " you've got one have nt you?[SEP]".[SEP]really bad reception service.[SEP]breakfast fantastic.[SEP]not ideal for middle age travellers.
3	the reviews that we read about the hotel were realistic and well written.[SEP]we were plenty surprised by the cleanliness and service - oriented staff.[SEP]yes, the room was a little small, but it was actually cozier than small.[SEP]we found the location very convenient to all the attractions that we were interested in.[SEP]it is a short taxi ride to times square or a good, brisk walk up 7th avenue to madison square garden, times square, or the restaurants and services in chelsea.[SEP]we definitely would stay there again.
6	what do you expect for the price?[SEP]booked this online the night before we arrived in sf while passing through.[SEP]$90 inc tax for the night but a few yards from union square, so we hardly expected the ritz.[SEP]more like a hostel than a hotel really, though the bed (small) was quite comfortable.[SEP]a couple of cockroaches paid a visit to us in the shower in the morning and rather let the side down, though they did appear quite friendly.[SEP]car parking is at an underground and rather dodgy garage a few blocks away - the hotel said the rate was $20 overnight but strangely we were charged $25 and they expected a tip (in vain!).you think the car is being parked there, but in fact it is driven to a lot elsewhere in town, as we caught them out.[SEP]central location for hotel but rundown area rife with assertive beggars - my wife waiting with our luggage outside the hotel was hassled / propositioned 5 times in the 15 minutes it took to retrieve the car from the garage, and had to take refuge back inside.[SEP]sad really as sf on our last trip a few years ago was so great.[SEP]this was the low point of a long tour of the states this summer.
2 8	spent five days for recent business convention at rai.[SEP]the location in relation to convention center is excellent and it is close to tram / metro.[SEP]it will take you 30 minutes to get to city center.[SEP]hotel was average but very expensive.[SEP]internet access will run you quite a bit of change.[SEP]eating options are limited and will require 20 minute walk outside of hotel.[SEP]staff were very pleasant and accomodating.[SEP]if you want to be close to convention center this is the place.[SEP]if you want to experience amsterdam's charms it is not.
6	we had a great stay in istanbul at the acre.[SEP]the staff are very friendly and helpful.[SEP]they will try to sell you tours and packages but wo nt hassle you if you explain you're not interested.[SEP]the rooms (we moved half way through so got to experience two) were clean, comfortable and fairly spacious, though they didn't have views.[SEP]the call to prayer could be heard in the morning so if you are a light sleeper it will wake you.[SEP]the rooms had fridges, safes and tvs and bathrooms with good showers.[SEP]the location really couldn't be better.[SEP]you can stroll around the corner to the blue mosque, the palace, the hippodrome and hagia sophia and from there either walk or tram to the grand bazaar or up to the bosphorus.[SEP]there are lots of restaurants near the hotel though they are all very touristy.[SEP]we visited the area with all the fish restaurants (can't remember the name) but the best food we ate was north of the golden horn where the smart istanbul crowd seemed to gather.[SEP]at lunch we either ate street food (the fish which they catch, grill and put in a bread roll down on the river is definitely worth trying) or cafes where you can point to the meze you want.[SEP]the breakfast in the hotel is good though it did get a bit samey - we tended to eat light so we had room for lots of food at lunch.[SEP]if you get a very good value deal, as we did, i can't see you regretting staying here.
5	first..[SEP]i didn't stay here as didn't have enough cash to be sincere![SEP]i just came there as invited by a family member from canada and did enjoy![SEP]i had one of the most amazing meet in my all life (i ’m foodie and also working in this industry..[SEP]so supposed to know what food means a part of my french ’s origins..) the meat was simply one of the purest thing in my all life as said and i can not forget the excellence of the place.[SEP]the hotel has an excellent location for sure and is a little old fashion style but god value as far as i ’m concerned.[SEP]enjoy at least a great lunch there![SEP]cheers![SEP]oliver from marrakech
4	i thought it sounded good and 5star review nailed it but: 1.[SEP]rooms tatty - less than 3star standard.[SEP]2.[SEP]service arrogant 3.[SEP]location (if you don't have a beach side room) poor - little better than a motel![SEP]4.[SEP]not a lot around it to do... which is ok if you don't like doing anything![SEP]5.[SEP]supermarket (only one small one which sold nothing!) expensive.[SEP]6.[SEP]pools packed at weekends... on a good point has loads of potential and nice gardens - but not any better than 3star![SEP]honest!
5 9	i booked this due to price - it was the cheapest - but i was anxious due to the bad reviews on this site.[SEP]however, i was pleasently surprised.[SEP]the room was big enough, light airy and fresh (no smells!).[SEP]it was clean and the bathroom was good.[SEP]the breakfast was what i would have expected and was more than adequate.[SEP]free parking and location ner to tube was adistict advntage.[SEP]i was particularly careful to note the staff at every opportunity as they have been heavily criticised here.[SEP]either they have completely new staff or people are unreasonable.[SEP]they were friendly and helpful.[SEP]my wife is fussy but she was happy with our stay.[SEP]bottom line: value for money.
3 10	my husband and i stayed here for 4 nights because the convention we were attending was next door at the convention center.[SEP]we did not have a choice of where to stay.[SEP]had we had a choice, we would have stayed somewhere on the strip and taken the monorail over.[SEP]to me, location in vegas is important and the hilton isn't close to anything.[SEP]there were two nice things about this hotel, the rooms and the pool.[SEP]we reserved one of the larger regular rooms.[SEP]it was larger and nicer than the rooms at the excalibur and nyny but not as nice as the venetian.[SEP]and it had a fridge in the room.[SEP]it also cost us twice what our room at nyny cost us.[SEP]given how little time we spent in the room, i didn't think the extra space was worth the extra money.[SEP]drawbacks other than location: old casino, the restaurants were expensive, and the staff didn't seem to be happy at all.[SEP]also, even though it is next to the convention center, it still took us 15 minutes to get from our room to the main hall of the cc, and you have to go outside.
5	my husband and i stayed in the kennedy hotel for a week last christmas.[SEP]we loved it![SEP]the staff were very friendly and the room was cleaned daily.[SEP]the complimentary breakfast was nice and we were able to take some with us for snacks throughout the day.[SEP]it is within walking distance of termini, the colosseum and many other tourist attractions.[SEP]the only thing that we didn't love was the location - which was a bit intimidating when darkness fell.[SEP]the price is right and we would recommend this place to our friends and family.
2	i stayed at this lovely boutique hotel based on reviews on trip advisor.[SEP]i could not have been happier.[SEP]the location was excellent - close to subway and sights of paris.[SEP]the hotel was small and personal.[SEP]my room was beautiful, with fabric panelled walls, and a wonderful balcony with 2 chairs and a table with views of paris - perfect for sitting out in the evening and drinking red wine and eating cheese and bread.[SEP]the staff were very helpful and spoke in english well.[SEP]the only criticism i could think of was the transport that the hotel organized for me to the airport.[SEP]the limousine service did not show up resulting in trying to get a taxi on a wet day in paris.[SEP]i almost missed my flight.[SEP]i would not recommend using the transport recommended by the hotel at all.[SEP]taxi is fine.[SEP]everything else was perfect and i would return in a heartbeat.
1	i blew off the not so great reviews and decided to book here anyway.[SEP]the location of the hotel is great, within a short walk to taxi ride to all the hot spots in uptown / downtown.[SEP]the exterior of the building is beautiful and steeped in history, as this hotel is a historical property.[SEP]we arrived at around 6:45pm, well after the 3 pm check in time.[SEP]parking is $24 for valet, so skip that and park in the parking garage north of the hotel where it's only $6.[SEP]checking in at 7 pm, guess what?[SEP]room is not ready.[SEP]told by aaron he would call housekeeping to check on the room, and in 30 minutes he would call me and let me know the room is clean.[SEP]guess what?[SEP]an hour later, no call.[SEP]walk to front desk, told still not ready.[SEP]unacceptable![SEP]4 hours after check in and my room is not ready?[SEP]unacceptable.[SEP]realizing we were not happy, a lessor room located on floor 4 was given to us, as well as a $50 food / beverage allowance.[SEP]this was cool on their part, and we used this quickly in the bar.[SEP]overall the place is ok.[SEP]it's quite dated inside, and there are many quirks to the place.[SEP]i will likely think twice about booking here again.
9	my wife and i stayed at this resort for one night recently.[SEP]the gaylord palms is one of the coolest places i've ever stayed.[SEP]the entire hotel has a huge atrium in the middle that looks like a jungle.[SEP]there are tress and plants everywhere and even alligators and turtles.[SEP]all of the shops, restaurants and bars are inside the atrium among the trees.[SEP]we didn't eat at any of the restaurants, but we had drinks at a very cool restaurant that is on a boat in a giant pond.[SEP]the rooms are very nicely appointed and overlook the atrium.[SEP]they feature free internet access, comfortable beds, double sinks in the bathroom, and a small balcony.[SEP]the best thing about the resort was the customer service.[SEP]even though we booked our room through hotwire, the front desk employee gave us a room with a king size bed in a great location.[SEP]everyone at the resort was very nice.[SEP]the only drawback were the high prices for food and drinks, but that's not unusual for a hotel.[SEP]overall we had a great stay at the gaylord palms.
1	simply amazing.[SEP]location's great, service staff fantastic (concierge remembered my name 4 days after speaking with me for less than 2 minutes) and attention to detail can not be faulted.[SEP]not once was i interrupted by chambermaids either to make up the room or for turn down service although i was in the room at irregular times of the day.[SEP]the sunday brunch is also fantastic.[SEP]a little pricey but well worth it.[SEP]the spread was nothing like i've seen before.[SEP]internet connection was free which was very useful.[SEP]i had a great view of both the hancock tower and lake michigan.[SEP]i will definitely go back to the four seasons the next time i'm visiting chicago.
6	i spent two nights on floor 7 - -all the walls are curved and everything is in black and red.[SEP]bed is circular but nicely firm.[SEP]hard to get ready when all your mirrors make you look like you are in a funhouse... i purposely wanted to stay here based on what i had learned from travel articles and other research and i will say the property in theory did not dissappoint.[SEP]loved the concept of the different " far out " designs, just wished the implementation was of better quality.[SEP]enjoyed riding the elevator and getting off on different floors just to take in the different designs.[SEP]biggest beef was the noise on floor 7 - -the halls and rooms have hard floors and i am convinced housekeeping had some sort of vendetta against me since both mornings staff felt the need to camp out right in front of my room and be really really loud -- banging, loud talking, etc.[SEP]location is not tragic but not necessarily convenient.[SEP]metro close but most major sights are at least two transfers away.[SEP]after a long day of sightseeing, one is not always excited to make another 45 minute trip back to the old town for nightlife.[SEP]top floor bar not open.[SEP]lobby bar crowded and staff not that friendly.
3	this hotel is five blocks fron the pike place market on pike st.[SEP]in the middle of everything.[SEP]macy's is one block away.[SEP]can't get a better location.[SEP]i am a light sleeper and truly appreciate a quiet hotel.[SEP]this place is really quiet and well built.[SEP](stayed on st.[SEP]pat's day) get a high floor for a great view.[SEP]has underground parking ($32 overnight) and a elephant & castle restaurant.[SEP]decent pub fare without leaving the building.[SEP]i will be back here.
3	i stayed here one night in april 2009 for a weekend break with a friend visiting london.[SEP]we wanted to shop in regent street / bond street, go to the ballet at the coliseum and go to a few nice bars in mayfair.[SEP]for a base just to sleep and have breakfast (perfectly adequate breakfast which was included in our room rate of £ 160 per night), this hotel is fine.[SEP]the location is great.[SEP]as mentioned in other reviews, the rooms are looking a little tired and in need of refurbishment, but at least they are clean.[SEP]faded nets, a few small holes in the bedsheets etc.[SEP]the room was a good size though.[SEP]our room was 184 and had a very dodgy, ill fitting lock - even when slammed shut from the outside we could push it open and had to get the porter to lock us out properly when we went out.[SEP]test your door thoroughly first and ask to me moved before you've unpacked all your stuff.[SEP]the man on duty at reception seemed to speak pretty poor english and did not understand our problem at first.[SEP]there is safe in the room, tea & coffee making facilities, tv and a hairdryer (but it's a bog standard hotel issue one, so bring your own).[SEP]all in all, nothing special, but perfectly fine as a base.
4	the timeshare (points) units were well appointed and comfrotable.[SEP]we stayed in a spacious 2 bedroom unit with 4 adults and 2 kids.[SEP]plenty of room.[SEP]the amenities were ample with a great pool area.[SEP]the location and landscaping left much to be desired.[SEP]the food and drink are way overpriced.[SEP]the sales pitch was low key.[SEP]if you can get in this may be a good alternative to an expensive hotel room suite.
1	there are many hotels in a large city like madrid.[SEP]we first stayed in one for much less money, and the location was a far walk to the prado and the amenities were few.[SEP]there are also hotels far from everything a tourist is interested in.[SEP]the radisson blue costs more, but is across the street from the prado, and freely gives many amenities.[SEP]they also video record a every transaction at the front desk, which could be useful because of the many pickpockets in the tourist section.
6	stayed at bay lake tower recently after cruise on the disney dream.[SEP]we had a 2 bedroom villa with a view of the lake - it was fantastic.[SEP]the two children probably would have been content to stay at the pool area rather than go to the parks.[SEP]safe pool with fun slide, very attentive staff especially lifeguards, the spray park and beach just added to fun to the area.[SEP]the staff from check in to check out were friendly, helpful and made you feel welcome.[SEP]probably the nicest timeshare accomadations i have seen.[SEP]perfect location to walk to magic kingdom or to access the contemporary facilities and restaurants and monorail.[SEP]we used room service several times and it was good and efficient.[SEP]an added bonus to dvc members staying there on points is the access to the roof top deck and lounge - a really nice place to have a drink and/or to watch the fireworks.[SEP]it was truly a very enjoyable stay and am looking forward to a return trip.
9	my husband and i stayed at the hampton inn airport south for 2 nights at the end of november.[SEP]my husband was there for business at sky harbour international, so the location of the hotel for us quite convenient.[SEP]overall our stay was quite nice - we had a clean, nicely decorated king room on the top floor.[SEP]the beds were extremely comfy, with nice new linens and a cozy white duvet.[SEP]breakfast in the lobby was not too bad - the coffee was good, and they supply take out cups if you want to take it with you.[SEP]there is alot of choice for the guest - yogurts, fruit, cereal, french toast, cereal, etc., so overall, an adequate breakfast.[SEP]the pool area was small but very clean, and plenty of fresh towels to use right there.[SEP]we didn't use the pool, but made use of the hottub in the evening.[SEP]very nice.[SEP]the only real negative was that the location of the hotel is not great.[SEP]there is not around the hotel, it seems almost on the edge of a residential area.[SEP]the hotel is an easy drive to the university of arizona (less than 10 minutes), so we found plenty of restaurants and pubs around the u of a.!
2	what a fabulous hotel for a lovely christmas break.[SEP]the hotel staff were so welcoming and were always available to answer our questions (which we asked nearly every day of our stay!) it was made even more personal by the fact thay they said hello to us and asked how we were, referring to our names (a little touch, but put a smile on our face).[SEP]the location of the hotel is convenient (right next to a convenient metro station and within 5mins walk of the eiffle tower).[SEP]the decor throughout the hotel is appealing, modern and clean and the beds provide a good nights sleep.[SEP]the air con didn't seem to work properly thou (this may have been with it being winter and us not fully understanding the machine), often it released hot air during the night meaning it got a little hot.[SEP]overall, i would definately recommend this hotel especially if you are looking for a relaxing, parisian experience.
1	i booked on lastminute.com for just £ 67.40 for 2 night double room.[SEP]very clean, good location, nice breakfast.[SEP]if you flight to tegel airport 21 min by bus 109 to stop near hotel.[SEP]from schonefeld bus and u - bahn 7about 50min.[SEP]close to potzdam and lake wanasee.
0	lovely hotel in a great location.[SEP]my husband & i took our 9-year - old son for his first visit to paris, and this hotel made our visit over - the - top perfect.[SEP]not only the location, which is quiet and yet so close to the eiffel tower as well as a block from the metro, bistros, grocery stores, and a divine boulangerie, but the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff as well.[SEP]everything we needed, they provided with a smile.[SEP]the owner of the hotel introduced himself and his daughter to us, and asked if we liked the hotel and if everything was okay.[SEP]how nice is that?![SEP]the rooms are a bit small, but the king - size bed in our executive room was so comfortable and the bathroom was huge and beautiful (and that shower head![SEP]divine.) the chair turned into a single bed for our son and was already made up when we checked in.[SEP]a very nice touch was the thermostat in our room - we made the room warm when we got back in the evenings (low 30's fahrenheit in january!), and later made the room cooler for sleeping.[SEP]the breakfast buffet was ample and delicious.[SEP]we could not have asked for a better place to stay in paris, and we will stay here again!
4	shabby hotel, but mostly clean unless you look out of the window.[SEP]no towel racks in the bathroom.[SEP]during a shower, the faucet totally detached from the tub, hitting me and cutting my ankle.[SEP]the desk clerk and maintenance responded quickly and fixed the tub, but were unconcerned about my leg.[SEP]the location of the hotel is good for quick access to the metro, but i wouldn't walk around the area at night.[SEP]denny's restaurant is across the street, and a vons grocery store is a block or two away.[SEP]the complimentary breakfast was good, with sliced fresh fruit and strong coffee.[SEP]staff were all very nice.
3	we stayed @ mama shelter for 3 nights, we've try many hotels in paris and i have to say that mama shelter is our prefered hotel.[SEP]the design is awesome (lobby, restaurant, rooms), lots of young and trendy guest but it could be pretty noizy around the bar during the evening.[SEP]the restaurant is ok but the service is too slow.[SEP]the bad side: the location.
0 1 2	we did not enjoy our stay at hotel cavour and we found the area surrounding termini station to be an undesirable and inconvenient place to stay in rome.[SEP]even if you ’re used to walking all the time, it is still a good 30 + minute walk to the nearest sites.[SEP]a better area would be around the spagna subway station.[SEP]aside from the location, the hotel was just not very nice.[SEP]the hallways smelled terrible and the room did n’t smell very good either and was very hot (in early march).[SEP]and when we tried to open our window to let the smell / heat out, the stench from the chinese restaurant in the alley wafted in — so you had to make a calculated decision regarding which smell was worse.[SEP]there was seemingly zero ventilation in the bathroom, which was probably no larger than a 10-foot closet.[SEP]the lighting was bad, the walls were painted an odd yellow - y color that made it feel dirty, and the air conditioner / fan did not work.[SEP]breakfast was bread and off - brand nutella and juice.[SEP]i believe we paid ~$88/night for the room, and it was not worth it — i’m not even sure that we would have stayed there for $50/night.
0 1	location - walking distance to the arc de triomphe, champps elysees, and metro stations.[SEP]relatively quiet streets after 11:00pm.[SEP]accommodations - normal size rooms for the area that were very clean with a large bathroom that had sparkling tile and facilities.[SEP]food - breakfast was a buffet with cereals, meats, cheeses, fruit, breads and pastries.[SEP]it included juice, coffee, and tea.[SEP]it was very attractive and fresh.[SEP]service - very accommodating staff with restaurant recommendations, walking directions as needed, luggage service and any thing we asked for.[SEP]all spoke english very well and were pleasant to talk to.[SEP]price / value - competitive with other similar class hotels that we looked at.[SEP]the value was excellent due to the service and accommodations provided.
0	great hotel with excellent location![SEP]the breakfast buffet is terrific.[SEP]service is wonderful.[SEP]i would definitely stay here again!
4	hotel was nice enough, the room we stayed in was clean and had just been updated, very spacious.[SEP]pool area was lovely, great for children.[SEP]the hotel had a film night around the pool and handed out popcorn for all the children.[SEP]dining wasa little pricey, but there was a small coffee shop selling coffee and muffins for breakfast.[SEP]one disadvantage was location, you needed a car to get into downtown.[SEP]old town was not too far away, so we did hire a taxi that evening.[SEP]tour bus collects passesngers each morning at 9 and 10.00, but the return was far too early, returning between 4 - 5.30.[SEP]although a nice hotel, i wouldn't stop there again, preferring something closer to the amenties and restaurents of san diego
2	i have stayed at many hotels in montreal... ranging from taj mahal to hotel gault, and this has to be the most disgusting experience i've ever had.[SEP]we booked for the august long weekend, and ended up leaving after the first night.[SEP]please don't get fooled by the ideal location, it is a pig sty and infested with bed bugs.[SEP]we didn't notice them until the next morning when i and my friend were literally covered with oozing welts on our faces and necks.[SEP]we called for the manager, who never came.[SEP]we demanded that someone come up to see the headboard and bed, and nobody came.[SEP]we finally had to go down to the front desk and get the owner on the phone.[SEP]the staff was unfriendly and spoke little english / french.[SEP]i thought it fishy that they tried to charge me three nights, in advance.[SEP]do not sign anything until you inspect your room.[SEP]if you don't want your vacation ruined and you don't want nasty oozing bites on your face, stay elsewhere!!!!!
0	the hotel is in a convenient downtown location.[SEP]it is a few blocks to the french quarter, but is within walking distance.[SEP]the streetcar picks up right outside the hotel so this is another option for getting the quarter.[SEP]the hotel was clean and the room was comfortable.[SEP]the front desk personnel were helpful.[SEP]the morning breakfast was pretty good also, however, there is just so much good food in new orleans that it is hard to pass up any opportunity to eat at a local restaurant.[SEP]this hotel was priced below the rates of others in the area and is a good deal.[SEP]they also have convenient, reasonably priced parking.[SEP]i would definitely stay here again.[SEP]i have absolutely no complaints about this hotel.
0	location not very good difficult to reach if you do not have taxi direction given by hotel to reach from cipro station are not sufficient rooms very old, need renovation better to look other hotels
8	weird service most amusing for us was kind of service provided.[SEP]may be that's because of ignorance about specific of new orleans.[SEP]but you can expect service person entering your room before 9 a.m. or answer mmm to your thank you![SEP]in restaurant.[SEP]and taxi driver on trip back to airport offered us tax free rate.[SEP]hotel rooms where unusualy big and felt empty but restrooms looked in need of repair.[SEP]i recomend to avoid breakfast in hotel.[SEP]it costs about $20 and is far from food standarts of new orleans and frankly speeking is mediocre.[SEP]but location is best of this hotel.[SEP]you are just around corner from bourbo street with all it's noise and other atractions of french quarter.
1	i stayed in this hotel 1st weekend december 2011, and would like to say it is one of the nicest hotels i have stayed in for a long time, rooms were very clean well organised and the bed was very large and comfortable, i travelled with my partner and another couple who were all equally impressed with this hotel.[SEP]the location is excellent as you are within walking distance of the central station as well as all other tourist attractions bars shops and restaurants.
1	a nice and clean hotel to stay for business and leisure.[SEP]but the location is not good if you need public transport.[SEP]it took too long for transport and waiting for bus.[SEP]but the swimming pool looks good although i never tried.
2	booked this hotel after a lot of research to find a good spot for a wedding anniversary visit to paris.[SEP]managed to get the valentine's special that included breakfast and a bottle of champagne in the price - great value and a good bottle of champagne too![SEP]the hotel is clean, in a quiet location for the area and perfectly located for all the central sights.[SEP]breakfast in the exposed stone lower basement with wall tapestries was lovely.[SEP]every member of staff we met was extremely polite, helpful and eager to please.[SEP]staying at the hotel made a great weekend even more special and we would definitely stay there again if we get the chance.
2	double room in the basement was tiny - literally about 30 cm space between the bed and the walls.[SEP]dark, dingy and not very clean.[SEP]location was not too bad, but expect about 25 minute walk into the centre of amsterdam (dam sqaure, red light district etc.) good tram - links though.[SEP]basic, cheap and value for money, i suppose!
4	our stay at green valley resort was a pleasant one.[SEP]the layout of the resort made it easy to walk to the office, pools, and playground, even with young kids.[SEP]the resort is situated right on the lake, although its at the top of a pretty steep hill.[SEP](if you need to carry items onto the boat docks plan to bring a vehicle and park).[SEP]the location of the resort is several miles from any busy retail and traffic areas so it has a remote feel to it.[SEP]the cabins are very close to each other but still allow for some privacy.[SEP]the cabins themselves were a bit dated, but clean and relatively spacious with basics like kitchen utensils provided.[SEP]we rented a pontoon on our visit and had a great time on the lake.[SEP]the boats are newer and well maintained.[SEP]chieko, the owner was very friendly and willing to answer the questions we had.[SEP]she and the staff made themselves available pretty much anytime night or day.[SEP]if you're looking for a hotel vacation this isn't your place, but if you're looking for a great no - frills weekend getaway with a family this is a great choice.[SEP]we're thinking about booking a family reunion for next year.
17	at check in i was notified that my 2 bed rooms had been downgraded to a one bed room with a mini fridge at an extra cost per night.[SEP]i was told this was all the hotel had available, should not have been because this room was booked well in advance![SEP]room was on non smoking floor, could smell smoke all night long, maybe from other rooms on same floor.[SEP]room was old looking needed major updating.[SEP]casino was ok, buffet was horrible and high priced.[SEP]service was terrible.[SEP]roxy's diner was a nice place to eat.[SEP]tower restaurant had a nice atmosphere but our server was to busy flirting and we were not impressed.[SEP]we had our car broken into the second night we were there and had to spend most of the next day getting a window replaced.[SEP]this was in the self parking area of the stratosphere.[SEP]i was told by our glass serviceman that they get around three to four calls a month at that location.[SEP]amazing that there are no security cameras.[SEP]i noticed locals and really seedy people walking across from some apartment buildings across the street right into the employee parking garage the leads to the self parking and security never stopped them and told them to go around to the front entrance.[SEP]i can not stress more that you stay at a hotel further up on the strip.[SEP]i would say from the encore and wynn towers on up.[SEP]stay away from the area around circus circus, the riviera and stratosphere.[SEP]pay attention![SEP]i would not recommend this hotel to anyone.
1 10	we were in disney last month.[SEP]after days of going online, checking reviews, pictures of hotels, locations we decided to stay in a hotel within disney.[SEP]we reserved and were all set.[SEP]well a week before our trip, i went online and was very lucky to come across great reviews of this holiday inn.[SEP]did my calculating and debating on what to do and changed the reservation.[SEP]since there was a free shuttle and we went for the option online for the breakfast brunch, kids eat free was great, night and day, we cancelled and reserved here..[SEP]the service was amazing, the rooms were new and locaction was great, it was clean.[SEP]the pool was nice, the breakfast buffet in our package was perfect, many choices and all yummy.[SEP]the shuttle service was timely, etc..[SEP]i would only say that the parking i thought should have been free as it is offered free in the other hotels near by.[SEP]the location is great for disney and outlet mall shopping.[SEP]my in laws do nt speak spanish only and had no troubles with communications.[SEP]the managment and staff were great, i had a dilema with a pizza delivery, and the staff in the hotel helped me out greatly.[SEP]it was not even their problem.[SEP]would totaly recommend this hotel and will stay there again!
2 7	despite mixed reviews here, we loved the moi.[SEP]the rooms are small, but our was very clean and well maintained.[SEP]we were literally a hundred steps from keawakapu beach.[SEP]that made it easy to just go out an do a few laps on the boogie board at any time.[SEP]the moi has become a days inn property instead of best western and the management seems intent on making upgrades and keeping things looking great and keeping customers happy.[SEP]the comparably priced hotel rooms at the mana kai next door paled in comparison.[SEP]the condo units at the mana kai cost nearly twice as much.[SEP]the two operative words for moi are value and location.
0 1	if you are on a budget and location is very important to you, then this is a good choice.[SEP]currently under some cosmetic changes, the doubletree is a comfortable, no frills place that is a perfect location for major sites and subway access.[SEP]the rooms are clean and the beds were comfortable.[SEP]of course the decor needs updating but i can overlook these things when the staff is friendly, helpful, and services are good.[SEP]the area of town if perfect for hitting the shops, broadway, rockefeller, etc.[SEP]and you can catch the subway literally outside the door for ride down to soho.[SEP]to me this was the right kind of hotel for a 3 night getaway, but if you are more into " w " style hotel or ritz then this may not be for you.
0 3	the best part about this hostel is its amazing location - it is literally around the corner from plaza mayor, and only a five - to - ten minute walk to plaza del sol.[SEP]both areas are extremely beautiful and are bustling with cafes, bars and restaurants.[SEP]there is also a metro stop right in this area.[SEP]however, to balance out the great location, the hostel has a few flaws.\ la perla asturiana claims that its staff speaks english.[SEP]unfortunately, that is only about ten percent true.[SEP]the staff operates on a need - to - communicate basis, meaning if they don't have to dig out their english skills, they won't.[SEP]the rooms are kept as clean as possible, which isn't saying much considering all of the furniture and bedding look as though they are extremely old.[SEP]still, all the necessities are there and the balcony, which allows you to step out into the fresh air, provides some form of satisfaction.[SEP]remember to bring your own toiletries.[SEP]there is a small computer located in the lobby where you can access the internet for 1 euro for 30 minutes.
1 2	basic hotel with limited facilities esp for eating.[SEP]location south of boston not too far from metro.staff ok, not more.[SEP]would not choose to go again.[SEP]ended up getting a taxi from airport as there was no bus pick up notice which was very poor as when we landed after 11 pm there was no taxis around!
5 6	i booked the hotel broadway at singapore airport through the hotel booking agent, as was struggling to find anything else within budget.[SEP]we ended up paying £ 40 a night for it - which isn't too bad i guess for singapore.[SEP]however, the room is like a cheap budget accommodation and extremely noisy.[SEP]the room is ok - i have certainly stayed in worse places - but not in hotels who claim to be 3 *![SEP]there is a bed, a bathroom with a shower (but no cubicle) and we had air con that dripped![SEP]there is no double glazing and we were kept awake all night by the traffic and loud booming noises from the restaurants and bars nearby.[SEP]the location isn't too bad - about 5 minutes walk to the mrt to access all of the main areas - and taxis aren't too expensive.[SEP]however, our taxi drivers tutted alot when we told them where we were staying and said that the hotel 81 was much better and cheaper![SEP](but not the ones in geylang!).[SEP]i would only book this hotel out of desperation - and would pack your earplugs!
1	if you don't mind sleeping at night, then this may be the place for you... between listening to the garbage pick - up at 2 am, honking cars, and literally listening the the conversation in the room next door, because the wall are so thin, we didn't have a restful night at all.[SEP]location is ok if you like tourist infested experiences.
0 0	i booked a room at the hotel based on the fact that it was supposed to have a good location, but even then, i was surprised at how good location actually was.[SEP]a few steps out the door and you get a good look at the hollywood sign, and in 2 minutes you are at the walk of fame, sunset boulevard.[SEP]the hollywood highland center is nearby, which is convenient for shopping, and i guess anyone who wants to walk around downtown hollywood should be more than happy with the hotel, which has good enough rooms and staff.
0	needed somewhere to stay between lax and venice beach and this probably was nt the best choice location wise as there isn't much around.[SEP]host was nice enough but stuggled to pick up my australian accent.[SEP]room was pretty dark, floors were average and my bathroom window was very flimsy.[SEP]overall ok stay but i would recommend looking elsewhere
3 4	well this is supposed to be a full service marriott (with prices to match).[SEP]i stayed for 3 nights with a convention.[SEP]notes: 1.[SEP]location is not great.[SEP]its nice on the bay but there is very little in walking distance.[SEP]2.[SEP]pool area is not particularly pleasant.[SEP]its kind of squashed in and the doubletree next door looked much nicer.[SEP]3.[SEP]the gym is small pokey and on three floors and, for the 1st time in many years, i opted to go jogging rather than use the gym.[SEP]my knees still hurt![SEP]4.[SEP]the internet didn't work in my initial room.[SEP]it took a couple of hours messing around to get to the point.[SEP]the hotel changed my room efficiently but it was hassle.[SEP]5.[SEP]my new room had some stuff wrong but i couldn't be bothered to report it.[SEP]its fine for a conference or a quick stay but its not up to normal marriott standards.
3	we'd recommend this hotel and would certainly stay there again.[SEP]the hotel was clean, tidy, free wi - fi in the lobby / breakfast areas and cables internet in the rooms.[SEP]the room was big enough, air conditioned and cleaned every day.[SEP]the location of the hotel is great and, although some reviewers comment on the probation office etc, you'll barely notice any of it - it is perfectly safe.[SEP]slight drawbacks to the hotel were - breakfast (which if good) - the area is too small for the size of the hotel and many days we went back to our room with breakfast.[SEP]you can sometimes wait a bit on a lift but the lifts are quick enough.[SEP]another nice positive to the hotel, aside from it being new etc, is the roof terrace (not yet opened when we were there).[SEP]also, the manager is about every day and speaks to the guests, which is a first for many hotels.[SEP]excellent positive experience overall.
0	the hotel was excellent, the location was about as good as it gets and the staff was outstanding.[SEP]we'll be back!!!!
5	although i was visiting the ritz on a business trip, and only paid for a few extra nights, i feel like we all would have been better off somewhere else.[SEP]the hotel is tired.[SEP]the carpet is old and musty and since the windows donâ€ ™ t open, you canâ€ ™ t get any fresh air in the rooms.[SEP]the air conditioning barely works, and the maintenance staff is in denial there is a problem, telling us that we didnâ€˜t know how to use the thermostat.[SEP]really?[SEP]itâ€ ™ s a funny location for a ritz, not in the seemingly more upscale condado area, but instead practically on the airport runway.[SEP]when youâ€ ™ re at the pool, the ground rumbles as the planes take off.[SEP]itâ€ ™ s crazy.[SEP]and donâ€ ™ t get me started about their â€œhigh speed internetâ€ �, which is free- because nobody would pay for it.[SEP]i think dial - up is faster.[SEP]on the housekeeping front, it was disappointing that i had to call up, twice, because by 4:00 my room still had not been cleaned.[SEP]most of the staff, like you would expect at a ritz, is very good.[SEP]too bad the hotel doesnâ€ ™ t earn an equivalent rating.
2	this hotel is school training hotel, so don t expect so much but still for the price you fell like you are in 4 star hotel.[SEP]student take care of you to well there is the problem but well i can adapt... so yes staff make mistake but it is great if you can past it but at 850 hkd a night not a big dill.[SEP]the worst is the location but the view is fabulous.[SEP]if you don't care payed 60khd for taxi it is a place i recommend to stay in hk
0 0 2	hotel is in average condition, away from the main business and shopping areas and a long walk (15 mins?) to the nearest mrt clarke quay.[SEP]most hotels in singapore offer free internet but not river view so you need to take this into account when comparing prices.[SEP]consider internet charge, breakfast not included and more taxi costs due to location.
5	this is a terrific place for a budget traveller to istanbul.[SEP]my room was very comfortable and really clean.[SEP]the bathroom was especially good.[SEP]i had tv including bbc and cnn.[SEP]the breakfast which is included was buffet style, generous and really nice.[SEP]i was especially impressed by the great location near the grand bazaar and a very short walk to the trams which made travel around the city really easy.[SEP]but the very best thing was the excellent service from the friendly staff.[SEP]they were so helpful and nothing was too much trouble.[SEP]i spent a week at the inter and highly recommend it to other travellers.
8	whoever developed the website for this hotel did a great job.[SEP]the hotel itself was nothing like what was published online.[SEP]our first room overlooked the parking lot and felt like a red roof inn.[SEP]one of our rooms did not have a remote for the tv and there was no alarm clock.[SEP]the guest chairs were so dirty and stained we were afraid to sit in them.[SEP]at 2:00 a.m. i had to ask the people talking outside to please quiet down so we could sleep.[SEP]our room was never made up the next day and we fiinally asked to be moved to a better location within the hotel and that room was better.[SEP]the advertised sunday brunch never materialized ; the advertised bars never opened and the advertised waterpark was much smaller than expected.[SEP]location was further than expected and you would not want to go outside the hotel at night as it did not appear to be too safe.[SEP]i would not recommend this hotel to anyone.[SEP]i think they have a lot of nerve calling this hotel a resort and charging a resort fee.
3 4	the hotel is old and the rooms are just ok.[SEP]the breakfast is bad.[SEP]there was only a croissant, some cereals, milk, coffe and machine juice... the service is not impressive and the receptionist will not do anything to make you feel welcome in your vacations.[SEP]the location is fair, there is a bus station right in front of the hotel and the manzoni metro station is 4 blocks away (10 min walking) but there is really not much to see around there, so you will have to take a bus / metro / taxi to go to restaurants, coffe shops and other tourist places.[SEP]i think it does not worth the price for this 3 stars hotel since you can get similar hotels in better locations for the same price.[SEP]looking around, most of the budget or 3 stars hotels seems to be old so, next time i will choose a better hotel in a great location even if i have to pay more for that.
10 11 11	the whole truth stayed @ this property and did find it to be extremely aged, (it was bought by the barcelo from breezes some time ago..[SEP]had terrible food, and the rooms were not nice at all..[SEP]if these things are important to you, then this resort is not for you..[SEP]the food was a huge disappointment, the matresses were very poor, the housekeeping service was sub par.[SEP]however, ~the dominican people are wonderful![SEP]very kind friendly.[SEP]the trapeze, rock - climbing wall are super.[SEP]the beach is nice.[SEP]however, we wish that we would have not gone to this property..[SEP]saved a little more $$and returned to cancun again, or puerto vallarta, hualtulco or ixtapa.[SEP]had been to puerta plata previously and found it to be nicer because unlike this location, you are not locked in..[SEP]nothing nearby for fun or shopping, no public transportation etc..[SEP]if we would have gotten sick or in need of medical attention, it would have been disasterous... many people we spoke with did enjoy the resort, but all had never been to all inclusive resorts in mexico or anywhere else.[SEP]really hope this helps..
1	just returned from a 3 night stay at this hotel with 15 male friends on a stag (batchelor) party![SEP]the location is excellent, right next to an underground stop and near open bus tour, shops and restaurants.[SEP]the hotel's communal areas are clean and modern however the rooms are small and not particularly special.[SEP]they are however cleaned every morning and have a safe (1 euro charge each time used) mini bar, t.v etc.[SEP]the view from our room was appauling.[SEP]breakfast is reasonable with hot and cold options in buffet style.[SEP]overall, the hotel is ideal for people who want somewhere relatively comfortable to sleep etc without the wow factor.
1	i stayed here for one night as a late booking.[SEP]yes, the location is good being close to euston, bloomsbury etc.[SEP]but this hotel isn't great.[SEP]the staff were warm and welcoming and the breakfast was good... but this does not make up for the lack of a lift, the highly dangerous stairs to the top floor... and the very noisy students.[SEP]i had a room on the top floor and had to negotiate the stairs with a case and laptop bag... not easy and found the carpet almost dangerous.[SEP]the room itself was average size and quite clean... and had basic ensuite facilities... but this alone does not improve the basic decor and tatty hallways and dangerous access to rooms.
10	this is a fantastic hotel to stay in if you're more interested in atmosphere than luxe amenities (since hotel does not have fitness facilities, conference rooms, etc).[SEP]this is one of a small number of special category hotels in istanbul whose facilities are old ottoman mansions rehabbed and brought into 21st century.[SEP]everyone who works here is most congenial and helpful, incl.[SEP]dining and sights recommendations.[SEP]mr.[SEP]ciftci at the hotel front office has a book of " cool restaurants in istanbul ".[SEP]the hotel is small -- only 17 rooms.[SEP]buffet breakfast (a fine one) occurs on the rooftop patio cafe, with a fine vista of the sea and the blue mosque.[SEP]they have an elevator -- not always the case in smaller hotels -- but essential for your luggage.[SEP]the neighborhood is very colorful ; ok for walking in during the day but might not be so great for women walking at night.[SEP]great location for seeing the historic sights of istanbul: a short walk to the blue mosque, hagia sofia, and the grand bazaar.[SEP]i would recommend this hotel very enthusiastically and without any reservations!
1 8	date: october 24, 2006 we stayed at this hotel for four nights after touring italy for a month.[SEP]it was, without doubt, the best accommodation for price, location and service of any of the hotels we stayed in.[SEP]our room was large and airy and overlooked the street where a market was set up each morning.[SEP]i never heard the stall - holders setting up although they were right beneath our window.[SEP]we loved the breakfast system - a voucher for coffee and a pastry at the lovely bar across the road.[SEP]it serves some of the best coffee in rome and, if you want a second cup, it is just 70c.[SEP]we also loved browsing in the market.[SEP]the stall - holders were delightful.[SEP]the hotel is only five minutes walk from the station, which makes the location ideal if you are travelling by train.[SEP]the staff were so helpful and answered all our queries.[SEP]massimo directed me to a great market where i bought a leather jacket.[SEP]we would not have found it had it not been for his helpful suggestions.[SEP]we will return to rome (we have thrown our coins in the fountain) and we will certainly stay at domus praetoria.
9 10	my husand, another couple and i decided not to stay at this hotel after we arrived.[SEP]first i do want to say that the staff was probably the best part of this hotel for the two / three hours we were there.[SEP]now for why we left..[SEP]our rooms smell of the chemicals that is used to clean the carpeting.[SEP]my friend is asthmatic.[SEP]there were stains on the comforters.[SEP]outside along the river were beer bottles and cigarettes laying on the ground.[SEP]the ashtray was overflowing with butts.[SEP]we used tripadvisor for our decisions on hotels for our trip.[SEP]after seeing the location, we were surprise that other reviews have no mention about the area where river terrace is located.[SEP]this might not bother many travelers but for those who it might, travelers should know that the area where the hotel is, is not the' cleanest'.[SEP]even though the hotel is supposed to be walking distance to where the shops, etc is, walking there is not the' cleanest' either.[SEP]we started walking for about 5 - 10 minutes and decided to return and checkout.
4	hotel staffs are friendly.[SEP]the room were tiny but very clean.[SEP]lobby always crowded.[SEP]there are many elevetors, but you always have to wait for a while.[SEP]hotel location is the best.[SEP]close to mrt, near foodcourt which open 24 hours.[SEP]there is a convenient store around mrt station.[SEP]there are some souvenior shops around hotel which you can get good price stuffs.
4	this was my second stay at this property in about two years.[SEP]my impression during the most recent stay was more favorable than the first.[SEP]the service seemed better, food quality very good and best of all the room i was in apeared to be newly remodeled.[SEP]i had one minor tv problem while there which they promptly fixed.[SEP]the only real downside is the location.[SEP]it is in a rundown industrial neighborhood on the edge of berlin.[SEP]that said, it is right at an s - bahn stop so you can easily get to nicer parts of the city.
0	the hotel is located in a crummy part of town.[SEP]after looking at our room, my wife and i left to find another hotel, as she did not feel safe this this part of town.[SEP]even after cancelling the room by phone, the hotel refused to refund the deposit.[SEP]the hotel lobby is tiny.[SEP]it's about 15 by 15 feet.[SEP]i can't imagine having more than three to four people eat breakfast this this location.[SEP]for $15 a night more you can stay at a great best western in la jolla ; just 15 minutes north.[SEP]i stayed in la jolla for three nights before trying the downtown area.[SEP]the bw in la jolla is in a great location in addition to having a nice outdoor pool.[SEP]i am a frequent best western user.[SEP]the cabrillo garden needs to drop the word " best " from it's name.[SEP]it surpises me that a good hotel chain would have the cabrillo garden as part of its chain.[SEP]it's a dump compared to other bw's.[SEP]we ended up staying at the embassy suites which was fantastic.[SEP]sure it was more expensive, but well worth it.
10	i was going to come to this hotel on the day of the big snow storm.[SEP]we had to call and see if we could pospone it until the next day they kindly said yes.[SEP]it was very clean.[SEP]no bed bugs!!![SEP]when we were sleeping it was 75 degrees![SEP]we could nt figure out how to turn the tempature down.[SEP]the rooms could have been a bit bigger.[SEP]are room was missing complientary water bottles and tour book.[SEP]i could care less, but it was of putting.[SEP]it was very small.[SEP]the location was a good 15 minutes from time square, nothing i could not handle.[SEP]i guess since i am used to staying at 5 star hotels this was a shock but over all it was ok.[SEP]we survived!
0	friendly staff, great location, close to everything and easy access to the entire island.[SEP]the studio was perfect and the price is so just![SEP]i loved it and will be back, for sure.
5	tired, dingy, and needs updating this was the first time i've stayed at a residence inn in several years.[SEP]the ones i stayed in before were nicer than a regular hotel room.[SEP]this property was not as nice as a regular hotel.[SEP]the place was clean and the staff were nice.[SEP]the room i stayed in hadn't been updated since the place was built in the 1980's.[SEP]the location of the hotel is not convenient unless you're going to the convention center.[SEP]it is in the warehouse district surrounding by some occupied and abandoned warehouses.[SEP]it didn't seem safe after dark.[SEP]luckily i used a reward night and didn't have to pay for the hotel.[SEP]i stay in new orleans regularly for business.[SEP]i would not recommend this hotel for someone looking for a good tourist experience.[SEP]it would probably be okay for folks staying in new orleans and working on the rebuilding efforts since each suite has a kitchen and there's a laundry room.
1	non smoking room reeks of smoke and it's really bad when the ancient air conditioning unit is running.[SEP]very old tv, sandpaper sheets on an uncomfortable bed and shady location.[SEP]the staff are so wonderful, it is a shame the hotel isn't as nice as they are.[SEP]i will not stay here again.[SEP]worst night of non - sleep in a very long time.
9	for the price we paid- around $30/night you can't beat this place.[SEP]stay in the upgraded rooms (42 in flat screen) and you won't be disappointed.[SEP]the bed was excellent and the room was surprisingly quiet and well located.[SEP]the hotel itself seems a little outdated and smoky.[SEP]i didn't like the casino.[SEP]you have to pay a $11/day fee but it includes internet unlike other hotels- plus you get two free drinks and two games, so its more like about $7/day the best things about this place were that the pool is beautiful -- and unlike any other place i've been they sectioned off one of the pools for adults only.[SEP]this was great because the place is crawling with kids during spring break.[SEP]nice gym![SEP]nice pool area![SEP]the location is fantastic- close to all the big hotels like new york, ny and mgm, luxor when most of the shows are playing.[SEP]the food at the buffet was decent but not spectacular.[SEP]there are many great restaurants in vegas, so you need to decide if you want easy or fantastic food.[SEP]the $30 all day deal is definitely worth it- you would easily spend that even eating fast food.
10 12	i stayed at hilton garden inn from august 15 - 17, 2008.[SEP]the rooms were clean and housecleaning came in once a day to tidy up.[SEP]the food at the restaurant was decent though higher priced than it should be.[SEP]for example, the breakfast buffet was around $15/person and it's pricey for people like me who don't eat greasy food first thing in the morning.[SEP]there were healthier choices like fruit, juices, bread, cheese and coldcuts.[SEP]the hotel's best feature was the shuttle.[SEP]we had some initial confusion because we thought the hotel shuttle came automatically at certain times to the airport.[SEP]we ended up waiting at the airport for a while until we realized we had to call it.[SEP]the shuttle service also took us to the metro and picked us up so we could take the subway downtown.[SEP]one of the shuttle drivers was surly but there are unhappy people in every job.[SEP]this hotel is not located near anything in montreal.[SEP]it's far enough from the airport and far enough from the touristy things that i would not recommend it for someone who is coming into town for sightseeing.[SEP]i will be visiting montreal again but i would not stay at this particular hilton garden inn again due to the location.[SEP]i'd definitely stay at another hilton garden inn based on the service i received here.
9	good hotel, meals and value overall, as long as you don't have hyatt or four seasons expectations.[SEP]rooms have fresh new furniture, carpeting, comfortable bed with lots of pillows - and the dining is surprisingly good.[SEP]buffett breakfast has excellent fresh orange juice all you want, ripe variety of fresh fruits, hot and cold cereal, pancakes, scrambled eggs, decent coffee, bagels with cream cheese, even smoked salmon all for $11.95.[SEP]staff is very accommodating and one doesn't have to wait most of the time for service - wi fi had a weak signal in my room but it's free, price is right, when are they going to step up with in room safes for laptop, valuables and cash not used during the day?[SEP]- it's 2006 four points, match the offerings of other good hotels.[SEP]no complaints - if you're a gold or platinum status local calls and toll free calls are free.[SEP]a surprisingly good set of cookies and fruit awaited my arrival with and they noted it was a return visit for me.[SEP]room is quiet and it's interesting eye candy to watch the conferences, weddings, variety of people coming in and out of this hotel.[SEP]their new signature pies are not worth tasting.[SEP]seems professionally run - good value, location, near bus line and burger king![SEP]atm machine only doles out $200 for a $2.50 charge.[SEP]east wing is better am told.
0	pretty touristy location and unremarkable hotel.[SEP]i stayed here because it was only two metro stops to my office in la, but what i saved on cabs staying in hotels elsewhere in the city, i spent on the internet access in the room.[SEP]$13 a day, which feels a little unrealistic these days.[SEP]also, i fail to understand why the hotel's website has rooms decked out in funky, bright colours.[SEP]no pictures posted here, nor the room i stayed in, has decor in anything but white and cream.[SEP]where are these rooms??[SEP]if you want to be in the thick of hollywood - walk of fame, touristy shops everywhere you look, right next to a mall etc - this is for you.[SEP]as a business hotel, i'm not sure it makes the grade next to other places i've stayed in la.
5 5	i booked a room here (same day, on a saturday, 2 weeks before christmas in nyc!!!) through one of the major travel websites, and got the room for much cheaper than i could find anywhere else.[SEP]when you're in the city that doesn't sleep, all you need is a bed to collapse into and this hotel serves quite nicely.[SEP]the rooms are spotlessly clean and efficient, and the staff are absolutely sweethearts.[SEP]my king non - smoking room was larger than i expected.[SEP]you're not staying here for scenery so don't expect any.[SEP]what you are here for is location, and if you are attending an event at msg or the javits center, you are only blocks away.[SEP]definitely a great place to stay in the city.[SEP]great breakfast too.
0 4	location location location![SEP]hotel is great, seems popular.[SEP]has a very present' eighties' vibe.[SEP]thankfully, our room seemed to have been recently renovated so i would advise you hit the top floors.[SEP]i would come back again since nothing upset our stay & the location was superb.
3	we stayed for 3 nights with 2 young children.[SEP]the apartment was very spacious, clean and well appointed.[SEP]breakfast was delightful and the service was great.[SEP]on the downside, the location wasn't great.[SEP]we were walking distance from the vatican, but the area felt a little seedy.[SEP]the apartment was in a gated complex with the gate right on the road.[SEP]it was tricky with young children getting in and out of taxis, but that's probably the norm in the rest of rome.[SEP]we used taxis to get around, and it was roughly 10 euros generally to get to the main central attractions.[SEP]there is a train line in the back garden which is quite noisy.[SEP]the people above us were also immensely noisy - the noise of the blinds opening, and furniture moving(like chairs being pushed in and out at a table) was enough to wake me through the night at least 3 times a night.[SEP]i would reccommend this place, but don't expect a peaceful nights sleep.
0	covenient location for kowloon business.[SEP]simply average accomodations.[SEP]stayed in executive suite and it was... average... if you can stay on hong kong island - try the jw marriott.[SEP]much nicer, better service, better restaraunts on hotel property.
6 7	great hotel - location eh it is so hard to find a good hotel in nyc, when you're going in blind.[SEP]my brother picked this hotel, he and his wife stayed in one room, my mom and i stayed in another.[SEP]nyc hotel rooms are notoriously small, these were very generous, could easily have accommodated 2 more people and still not gotten in each other's way, full bathroom, lots of room to put your toiletries down.[SEP]you can request your choice of type of pillow![SEP]good front desk, attractive lobby.[SEP]not happy that you had to pay like $8 for 15 minutes of computer time but maybe this is normal in the city?[SEP]only complaint but for me was a big one, was the location.[SEP]it was a 20 minute walk to attractions, and had to cab it more than i would have liked.[SEP]aside from that, i would have stayed here again, when i visited the next month.
2	we had large spacious rooms with microwave and refrigerator, bed and linens were extremely comfortable, fancy toiletries provided in large bathroom.[SEP]wonderful breakfast buffet - just wished they had a larger area to eat in.[SEP]location is a tad difficult to find.[SEP]if you pass the home depot, you're on the right track.[SEP]keep going - the hotel is at a cul de sac.[SEP]parking is limited and for compact cars.
4	we spent just one night is the historic part of the hotel, room 640.[SEP]we thought it was very charming.[SEP]it is small but, very clean, and had everything you would need.[SEP]very comfortable king bed, large flat screen t.v., small refrigerator, coffeemaker, ironing board, safe and decorated beautifully.[SEP]the location is perfect, close to union square.
1	we stayed at this property for a convention in october, 2011.[SEP]the location was great for the convention.[SEP]i walked to the convention center, it took about 15 minutes.[SEP]it was a nice walk.[SEP]the real bargain is the trolley that runs right by the hotel and all aver the area.[SEP]you can purchase a pass for $2.00 per day, we bought a 3 day pass for 6.00 and rode all over town![SEP]it even takes you to major attractions like sea world, and they tell you where to transfer for the other parks.[SEP]the pick up fro it is right outside the hotel.[SEP]the hotel also has a pretty good breakfast.[SEP]their managers reception is really just some chips in a bowl.....[SEP]rooms were nice, there aren't any queen size beds though, just double or king.[SEP]i slept on the sofa bed, and it was surprisingly comfortable![SEP]all is all, our stay was very comfortable and i would recommend the hotel.
0	perfect location, 2 min from central station and a further 2 min into the city centre.[SEP]breakfast was ok but always served straight away.[SEP]we stopped at the front of the hotel and the noise from the road was loud during the day as it is on one of the busiest roads but was quite for the night.[SEP]overall the stay was pleasant.
1 5	we stayed 4 nights in this hotel in an elegant and very quiet room in the attic.[SEP]particularly considering the excellent location in the centre of a capital city we had plenty of space, very comfortable bed, modern look.[SEP]staff were friendly, answered my emails beforehand very promptly.[SEP]a metro stop is just around the corner.[SEP]we booked via the eurostar website and got a good deal, just over 100 gbp a night (without breakfast, but there are plenty of cafes nearby).[SEP]it's not cheap but we will definitely stay there again if we can get a similar deal because this hotel and its location are worth it.
7	this is one of the more rundown doubletree i've stayed at.[SEP]the lobby feels as though it was decorated in the 80s with glass etageres lit with neon lights, leather chairs that suggest you should be wearing a don johnson a la miami vice bright blue suit.[SEP]having said that the rooms themselves are what one would expect of a doubletree.[SEP]the bathroom had all the accoutrements one needs.[SEP]the welcome chocolate chip cookie still warm was perfect with a cup of in - room coffee.[SEP]the balcony attached to the room is large enough for two chairs and a table for a nice morning breakfast.[SEP]the view of course, is a bit lacking, as it looks over highway 5.[SEP]location is less than central, requiring a good 20 minute walk to the gaslamp district and even trying to figure out how to get to the hotel is difficult, if one does not have a gps to guide through each turn (one wrong turn and you're on the wrong side of the highway).[SEP]while getting a cab to and from the hotel is not difficult, given the number of hotels available, we'll likely stay elsewhere next time.[SEP]lastly, for some reason the faucet plumbing was faulty and everytime you washed your hands, you'd hear an amplified echo of water dripping through different pipes for the following 5 minutes.[SEP]we did call to complain about it but were told there were no quickfixes.[SEP]given how late it was, we did not want to move rooms and obviously just stopped using the faucet.
1	when i go to big cities i always chose the hotel mainly by the location.[SEP]the westbury in kensington is a bit of a disappoinment as it is close to the high street kensington but not much more.[SEP]when you stay in the one in mayfair you have the whole of london at you doorstep.[SEP]the service is good but not exceptional.[SEP]again i think better in mayfair.[SEP]the decoration a bit dated, expecially in the bedrooms.[SEP]i would stay again in the mayfair one but not in the kensington.
1	the staff at the langham hotel in hong kong made us feel very special from the time we checked in until we left.[SEP]it is in a great location and the advice and suggestions provided by the concierge staff was great -nothing was too much trouble from shopping malls and how to get there to tourist sites.[SEP]we have stayed at other hotels in the area but we will now only stay at the langham in hong kong - this was our second vist and exceeded expectations.[SEP]our room was ready when we arrived and the staff accompanied us to our room.[SEP]there was the beautiful crisp linen and heavenly pillows as well as fresh fuit daily, definitely the best service we have ever experienced - a slice of paradise where you can escape the hustle and bustle of this beautiful city and slip into an elegant era - regenerate and then take off again.[SEP]we felt very safe and look forward to our next stay.[SEP]the staff and management are to be congratulated on providing such exemplary service - even when it was super busy with chinese new year celebrations.
0	the hotel was a good value for the location and type of room (superior view overlooking la rambla, soundproof windows, included breakfast).[SEP]it was approx half the price of hotels on the same block and i imagine the rooms were similar.[SEP]we checked in early (7 am) and hotel was able to get us a room by 10 am.[SEP]appreciated after an overnight flight.[SEP]the breakfast is 10 euros / person if you don't purchase it with your room.[SEP]fairly basic breakfast, but we found that during the off - season not a lot of choices in the area aside from dunkin donuts and starbucks (both on the same block as hotel).[SEP]another reviewer mentioned about work noise being at 8 am and continuing to 8 pm.[SEP]we did experience this in the lobby, so while you don't hear it in the room - it is annoying to walk around each time in and out (small lobby).[SEP]we would stay here again!
3	i found this hotel excellent and quite frankly you get what you pay for in any european city.[SEP]we also had breakfast included in our room price which was fine.[SEP]good selection and perfect for the short stay visitor.[SEP]the location is good if you don't want to be in the throng of things.[SEP]it's very near all the museums and is in a more upmarket district than those further down towards the dam square etc.[SEP]nice little cafes and excellent restaurants nearby.[SEP]good safe neighbourhood and within easy walking distance of anywhere in the dam.[SEP]right next to the tram stop also and perfect for drinks in the leidesplein area.[SEP]the room was okay, big windows out on to the front street.[SEP]bathroom not brilliant but workable and plenty of room for luggage.[SEP]no hairdryers for the ladies so beware and take your own.[SEP]good sized twin beds in the double room and cleaned every day.[SEP]basically you only ever use your room to sleep and revisit to change clothes in any city so it was perfect for that.[SEP]it looks exactly like it does in the pictures with the fancy minimalist reception area too.[SEP]the only downside, if i can squeeze one out, is that the shop underneath the hotel is being renovated therefore there was rather loud banging on saturday morning, but of course in any city you're not there to lie in bed so it wasn't a problem.
2	not a very interesting hotel.[SEP]some rooms are located just above the highway and the noise was so important that a collegue obtained to change her room.[SEP]i can not understand why some others customers do mention a " good location " since you are at 15 min walk from the city center with highly climbing streets... the rooms are correct but nothing more.[SEP]you need to ask if you want to have shampoo in the bathroom (forgotten every morning or so).[SEP]the breakfast is poor and is spent in an ugly space.[SEP]the staff is not educated.[SEP]we are clearly very far from the european standards...
3	stayed there in february 2011.[SEP]got a double upgrade to a very spacious suite.[SEP]the view however was not great.[SEP]and the location of the hotel in manhattan is far from ideal.[SEP]overall, everything was ok but it lacked excitement and glamour: the entrance lobby is cramped and freezing and looks like a 3-star hotel, there is no sauna or swimming pool, there is nobody to help you with luggage when you arrive, etc.[SEP]the same applies to the room: very modern but rather dull (unlike the newly opened setai, where modernism meets design sexiness).[SEP]i booked a very good rate online so at least it was god value for money.
8	stayed here in february 2011.[SEP]the hotel was nice and clean, staff at the front desk were helpful.[SEP]even had a good location for getting to and from disney world which the hotel offered a shuttle to and from daily.[SEP]while the first room they put us in had a defective door which you could pop the lock with by putting your shoulder into it, they promptly fixed it and put us in another room on a different floor.[SEP]the pool was quite nice with the cute little pirate ship in the middle of it.[SEP]there's a walmart down the block or an easy cab ride if you don't want to make the trek anyways where you can load up on groceries which we did while we were here.[SEP]overall i would say the most impressive thing was about the staff, seems they listened and went above and beyond to recommend things to do.[SEP]a+++ i would for sure stay here again if i ended up in the orlando area for a vacation again.[SEP]though i might rent a vehicle for the entire stay rather than simply having one for a day or two since other than the disney shuttle getting to and from locations was a little hard since the outlet malls and most shopping like mall at millenia are quite a distance without them.[SEP]also of note the cab is fairly pricey sitting around 35 to mco so it could be worse, but those are minor things considering the hotel was still really good.
3	we've been going here yearly for decades.[SEP]rooms are very clean.[SEP]sheets / towels are always crisp and very fresh.[SEP]love the location close to universal.[SEP]can walk back to the hotel within 10 minutes from anywhere in the park.[SEP]we love the palm restaurant.[SEP]the kitchen has really good food with good prices.[SEP]always something going on at the hotel but we were still able to go to sleep in quiet well before midnight.
0 1	the hotel is in the pleasant embassy quarter in the north east, too far away from the centre to walk, but a relatively easy bus ride away from the repubblica metro stop.[SEP]still, for such a distant location it is an expensive hotel.[SEP]upon first view i tended to understand the steep price, because the principe torlonia looks great from the outside, and the garden, while not big, is also very nice.[SEP]the big problem came when entering the room.[SEP]i should point out that we didn't stay in the main building, so i can not comment on those rooms.[SEP]we stayed in one of the special hotel suites in the little, separate building in the garden.[SEP]while these suites were comfortable enough, the smell of mold and fungi was so strong that one could barely stand it.[SEP]ventilation did not solve it, so it must be a persistent problem.[SEP]for this price this is really unacceptable.[SEP]so if you decide to stay at this hotel, request that you are in the main building.
9 10	just returned from a business trip with a conference at this hotel.[SEP]this was my first trip to boston.[SEP]the intercontinental boston is very nice.[SEP]what struck me the most was the cleanliness.[SEP]it is a newer hotel so it still has a nice, clean feel to it.[SEP]for some reason i expected more from the lobby, restaurant offerings, common areas especially for the price paid for the room.[SEP]the rooms are nice, with nice sized bathrooms with tub and shower.[SEP]the work out gym was nice and very adequate.[SEP]there is a nice place to sit outside at the water's edge.[SEP]it is close to the south " t' station, but otherwise in a poor location.[SEP]it is a fairly long walk to a convenience store for bottled water etc..[SEP]and most of the action in boston is elsewhere.[SEP]although boston is a walking city, i still like to be able to get somewhere quickly for a late night snack.[SEP]front desk service was fair.[SEP]there was a language barrier at times.[SEP]i finally gave up trying to get my priority points added to my stay.[SEP]the concierge desk was very helpful.[SEP]i would probably stay here again, but would likely look for a hotel a little less expensive and in an area with more to see and do.
5	i was here for a business and pleasure trip, and this hotel was ideal![SEP]it was lovely to be such a short distance from the train station upon arrival.[SEP]i actually walked, with 2 large cases, from gard nord, and it wasent too much trouble (although lots of steps, i do nt think paris is very diasabled - friendly.) the hotel staff could nt have been more pleasant and helpful, a total credit to the hotel.[SEP]they were friendly, knowledgable, spoke perfect english (i felt a bit ignorant!), and helped me book an unusual itinary, where there was no commision involved for them (i went on a segway tour, the best thing ever!).[SEP]i was upgraded to a superior room, which was light, spacious, and in very good order.[SEP]the location is out of the centre, but quite, and very close to the metro.[SEP]go for a wander, there are some lovely shops and cafe's by the canal waiting to be discovered.
0	this hotel is in a great location.[SEP]we could walk everywhere or hop on the subway if we had to go further.[SEP]everthing was close by.[SEP]the room was a little tiny but quiet and clean, the staff friendly and helpful.[SEP]we dined at their very own restaurant downstairs - the food was very good and reasonably priced.[SEP]i would recommend this little hotel to anybody.
0 3 19	nice hotel, great location my husband and i stayed at the marriott for our honeymoon.[SEP]we were there from sept.[SEP]11 - 17.[SEP]the hotel is located right across the street from the beach.[SEP]you can check out the hotel pool towels for use at the beach.[SEP]i agree with other visitors that said that the hotel pool is small.[SEP]we never used the pool.[SEP]the hotel is located across from resortquest which is one of the major pick up / drop off locations for the tour buses.[SEP]there are plenty of activities to do.[SEP]you should never get bored.[SEP]the locals are friendly and helpful.[SEP]we didn't rent a car but would consider it when we go back.[SEP]you can get around easily without a car though.[SEP]we stayed in the corner deluxe room... on the 18th floor.[SEP]we had a great view of the ocean.[SEP]i think if we were on a higher floor we would be able to see diamondhead as well.[SEP]we sat on the balcony and watched the sunsrise every morning.[SEP]the only negative comment about the room would be the lighting in the bathroom.[SEP]it was very dim and gave off a red hue.[SEP]even with the poor lighting we'd stay here again because of the location and easy access to everything.
0 6 12 13	our very large family booked rooms at this hotel because we were attending a wedding and it was very convenient location for getting to the ceremony and reception.[SEP]after the bookings were made, i decided to read the reviews here on tripadvisor.[SEP]believe the horror stories!!![SEP]although the staff and the rooms were fine, the first thing i noticed is that there are no safes in the rooms.[SEP]this was my cue to keep all my valuables with me throughout the weekend, which i did.[SEP]unfortunately, not all of our family members did so.[SEP]the end result was that, at 3 am, they returned to one of the rooms to discover jewelry, a laptop, wallets and bags stolen from the room.[SEP](the thief was kind enough to take my brother in - law's license and registration out so he could still drive home the next day.) the cleaning lady explained that a man came into the room that afternoon and claimed to be the occupant, at which point she left.[SEP]however, she was unable to describe him when asked.[SEP]it's interesting to note that we left at 2 pm, the shift change at the hotel occurred at 3:30pm, and purchases were made on the stolen credit cards at 4 pm.[SEP]inside job....?[SEP]the bottom line is that nobody should have to go through this kind of hassle.[SEP]unless you arrive without a car or any other valuables, find another hotel to stay at![SEP]your cars and personal belongings can not be trusted here!
1 4	i stayed at the hotel recently with my husband and another couple.[SEP]i don't think we were overly impressed with the service at the hotel and the location was ok.[SEP]breakfast was not included 16 euro breakfast, seemed over priced for what was included.[SEP]staff seemed a bit spacey.[SEP]overall the hotel was clean, but i prefer a location closer the latin quarter - more cozy less busy streets.
1 2	stay away don't be fooled by the low internet rates and the comestic transformation of a holiday inn into a hilton.[SEP]issues: 1) windows provide no insulation from heavy traffic and screaming drunks that pour from the sleazy bars surrounding the hotel ; 2) paper thin walls means that you will be awaken at 3am by tandruffs and flights coming from adjacent rooms and corridors (do not expect any assistance from the front desk) ; 3) sleazy area in the middle of chinatown not in the financial district ; 4) rude staff with an attitude that belongs at the four seasons or mandarin oriental and not in a mid - priced hotel.[SEP]for $20 more you can stay at any of the boutique hotels around union square that provide not only a better location but a much friendlier welcoming.
2 4	after having stayed at other palace hotels, we were looking forward towards spending our holiday season vacation at playacar palace.[SEP]however we were disappointed from the beginning.[SEP]the food is fair at best, the hotel is located next to the very loud and busy ferry port, a nightclub and skydiving office, and the pool music blasts so loudly from early morning until late at night.[SEP]the loud music blasting from the pool wakes you up early in the morning and makes it hard to sleep at night.[SEP]overall it's not a peaceful location nor is the atmosphere relaxing.[SEP]the one positive was the service- the employees are so kind and dedicated.[SEP]they make up for the other major shortcomings.[SEP]however, the supreme service was disrupted when a d list celebrity party planner and his rowdy entourage of 150 people overtook the hotel.[SEP]the hotel forgot about the rest of its regular guests and devoted all its attention and amenities to this huge vip group.[SEP]several guests commented that it felt as if everyone else did not matter once the vip crew showed up.[SEP]this vip group threw massive and very loud / disruptive parties each night that went into the wee hours of the morning.[SEP]so much for a restful and enjoyable vacation.[SEP]we will never frequent a palace property again as their true colors shined this trip.
3	we booked our hotel after reading the tripadvisor reviews.[SEP]we were not disappointed.[SEP]our trip to paris was an amazing experience!![SEP]the k+k was in ideal location for all the wonderful sights.[SEP]we were able to walk to so many places and the weather was perfect.[SEP]the staff at the hotel were exceptional and always helpful.[SEP]it was truly appreciated.[SEP]the room was clean, comfortable and had an amazing view.[SEP]we loved the ambiance of the hotel and its convenience to so many restaurants (especially cafe flore and les deux magots) along st.[SEP]germain boulevard after long days of touring.[SEP]my husband has a medical condition and we requested directly to the hotel for a non - smoking, non - pet, large bed room.[SEP]the hotel was so prompt at confirming the reservation and guaranteeing our preferences.[SEP]we would recommend this hotel to any of our friends in a heartbeat and will be returning again in future trips.
2	beautiful facility, and excellent breakfast.[SEP]the coffee was wonderful.[SEP]location is remote and it seems out of place in the surrounding area.
2	from slippery / oily marble floors in the bathroom to a pile of someone else's dirty towels greeting us, first impressions were not favorable.[SEP]although housekeeping did take care of the problem, the indifference by the other hotel staff was surprising.[SEP]the hotel's location is inconvenient if you are wanting to visit the casinos on the strip.[SEP]in addition, no shuttle service to and from the airport is offered.[SEP]for a fairly new hotel, it already looks worn, particularly the furnishings in our room.[SEP]although various amenities were offered, additional charges - above and beyond the 5-star rates already imposed - applied to each of them.[SEP]we always try to look for the positive, so here it is... the bed was comfortable and the view from the 58th floor was nice.
3	not a bad stay, a pretty good value... especially the free parking.[SEP]for some reason one night the hotel turned off the air conditioning just after midnight.[SEP]a little annoying, but they turned it right back on when i called and asked about it.[SEP]the biggest warning, however, is that this hotel is located very near a rather seedy area off st catherine's.[SEP]since this was my first visit to montreal, i wasn't sure about the specifics of that location... not really family friendly.[SEP]not unsafe mind you, just not what i expected.[SEP]but if you know that going into it, and don't mind, then this place is a good find.
1	time and time again as i stand jaded by brutal service and hotel properties, a westin hotel restores my faith.[SEP]the downtown location is great, staff was excellent and you can never go wrong with a heavenly bed -- the first to market and still best by my standards.
3	we recently stayed at the st giles for 4 nights and, overall i'd say that our stay was a very good one.[SEP]ok, the rooms are a bit on the small side but ours was clean and tidy and well prepared every day.[SEP]at the end of the day, the chances are that if you've stayed here you're only going to use the hotel as a base for your shopping / sightseeing / business so you'll only be sleeping / getting changed there anyway![SEP]you'll certainly struggle to get a better location with oxford street less than five minutes walk away and some fantastic restaurants in soho only five minutes on top of that![SEP]what i would say is make every effort to have a room that is situated away from the lifts![SEP]we were iniitially allocated room 532 which was great - until about 3 am the next morning when it was obvious that the herds of drunken elephants trampling noisily past our room on their way to and from the lifts were going to continue doing so for quite some time - and so they did!![SEP]next morning we got in touch with reception and told them our tale of woe.[SEP]i would suspect that this was not the first time they'd heard this tale as they allowed us to change room with no hassle at all (i would have to say that i found the staff to be very helpful at all times).[SEP]after that, a great stay was had!!
0	weekend trip, location was a little walk from the malls and attractions.[SEP]the pool is alot smaller than the website shows.
14	booked a one week stay via expedia from uk (together with flights with bmi).[SEP]on arrival, check - in was empty and we asked about any upgrates.[SEP]pleased to say we got a free upgrade to a strip view room which had an excellent view (21 - 097).[SEP]also got a non - smoking king which was a bonus.[SEP]the room was clean, although a little on the small side with not a great deal of storage.[SEP]it was also a little dark, even with all the lights on, but the bed was super comfy.[SEP]overall, we were pleased with the room, had no problems with cleanliness or towels, as others have commented on.[SEP]we even requested extra hangers and they were delived within 15 mins.[SEP]one big plus of the hotel, was because it wasn't that large it was quite quick and easy to get to your room from the lobby.[SEP]only ate at the coffee shop for breakfast and wasn't that impressed, there are too many great places in vegas to bother eating here again, although the on - site starbucks was very useful.[SEP]didn't eat anywhere else in the hotel.[SEP]pool area was quite small for the size of the hotel and very busy, esp at the weekend.[SEP]not a great place for a relax as it was quite lively and loud.[SEP]overall, even though i have been quite negative we really enjoyed our stay, and wouldn't hesitate going back.[SEP]great value for money, and we thought the location was excellent.
1 11	the service and staff at the napa river inn were friendly and helpful.[SEP]the location could not be beat.[SEP]you can walk everywhere from this hotel, right on the river, which we did.[SEP]the parking is free in front of the hotel and the breakfast was included but it is from a bakery and mostly sweet pastries with no substance for a good breakfast.[SEP]the food was never hot.[SEP]we ended up eating breakfast out one day.[SEP]the hotel is very old so the walls and floors are very thin and we were woken up early every morning by an upstairs room walking back and forth and we could hear voices and tv next door.[SEP]the shower was inadequate pressure so it took a while but was ok.[SEP]the room was very nice, however, and that made up for a bit.[SEP]the spa services were just massages, no gym or pool but was ok.[SEP]due to the noisy rooms and inadequate, high carb only breakfasts, we would not stay here again for the dollar value.[SEP]only the location was the best feature.[SEP]ps.[SEP]we did a limo wine tour with beau tours thru the hotel website and would also not recommend it.
1	it's been the first time i ve been to nyc, and this hotel made my trip even better![SEP]nice people, great atmosphere, service and location.[SEP]this will be my top pick in the future![SEP]got ta check it out recommended!
0	fair hotel in a poor location.[SEP]our room was disappointing - smelled very damp, wet patch on carpet.[SEP]they told us the ac was leaking but it could not be fixed and we could not move room.[SEP]found reception staff quite unhelpful the hotel itself is fine - breakfasts are good, public areas pleasant, lovely pool.[SEP]serious lack of sunloungers!!![SEP]restaurant quite expensive.[SEP]the hotel bus into rome is a must for tourists, cheap and fairly regular but beware - it gets very full in the evening and you risk being stuck in the city!!![SEP]you're quite restricted by the location of this hotel and we found that because of the heat we couldn't spend as much time exploring as we would have if we'd had a city centre hotel which we could just pop back to.[SEP]also be careful when wandering around outside grounds as we came upon used needles - flipflops and walking in dark = no no.[SEP]we got a good deal so it was fine for what we paid but not the usual sheraton standard.
0	this hotel is in a great location - easily accessible to railway and airport shuttle bus.[SEP]as with most italian hotels the rooms are small but adequate.[SEP]breakfast was good and we tool advantage of a 20euro meal offer and it was excellent value.
2 3	the hotel is great, typical homewood suites quality which is great.[SEP]the issues i had were exterior to the hotel itself.[SEP]unless you intend to stay right in " vacationer central " don't go to this location.[SEP]the traffic, particularly in the evening, is horrid.[SEP]also, the restaurant prices in the area are outrageous, and there are very few franchise restaurants within walking distance where you can get a regularly priced meal.[SEP]expect every dinner to be $25 per person or considerably more.
0	great location and great staff made this hotel the perfect spot for our roman holiday.[SEP]the rooms on the 6th floor have balconies looking out on the pantheon and piazza della rotunda.
6	i can see how a picky person could rip this place apart.[SEP]however the fact of the matter is, you're so unbelievably close to times square you could crawl, the rooms were quiet for sleeping, the rooms were comfortable and very clean, front desk is very efficient with providing anything you may need to make your stay better, they were also excellent with providing maps and help of where to find locations.[SEP]you are not going to beat the prices of this hotel in times square, with a private bathroom in your hotel room.[SEP]last time we stayed in new york we stayed at lower priced wonderful hotel up on 78th street.[SEP]which was wonderful and peaceful, but inorder to make to the shows or get tickets at the tkts booth, we were constantly on the subway.[SEP]if you stay here at the best western, the tkts booth is 2 blocks, with it being so close we were able to make it to 7 shows in 5 days with excellent seats for all of them![SEP]reality is yes, the rooms are small, but you're hardly in your room hopefully, the cleanliness and location would bring me back as a return client.[SEP]there is a tons of wonderful restaurants and pubs in the area too![SEP]it's a winner![SEP]one suggestion: if you are a taller person, make sure to book at least a queen size room, the double was comfortable, but a little small.[SEP]they have very comfy bedding and pillows too!
1	for the price i paid (â£35), i couldn't ask for better.[SEP]location is great - 5 minutes from pimlico tube and 10 - 15mins walk from victoria.[SEP]located in a quiet residential area in a road with lots of other hotels and b&bs.[SEP]as a single female, i felt perfectly safe returning around midnight.[SEP]the room and bathroom are small, but as the hotel is located in a terrace of old houses, you can't expect anything else.[SEP]if you are looking for large rooms, go to a hotel built for the purpose.[SEP]breakfast is fine - toast / cereal / croissants / yoghurt / cheese with tea / coffee / hot chocolate from a machine.[SEP]also scrambled egss / bacon / sausages / beans / hash browns for full breakfast.[SEP]check in / out was fast enough, and staff were pleasant.[SEP]rooms were quiet.[SEP]there was good tourist information in the rooms.[SEP]the only quibble i would have would be the lack of security in the luggage room.[SEP]you were given a key and left unaccompanied in the room, so anyone could interfere with other bags.
2	we have just returned from jays and we had an absolutely fantastic time![SEP]from the second we arrived (with a chaffeur to collect us from the eurostar arranged by the hotel) we were made to feel extremely welcome.[SEP]the hotel was beautiful and in a fantastic location - only minutes from the centre.[SEP]our room was lovely and incredibly spacious, in fact the weather was beautiful but we still spent time in our room as it was so lovely.[SEP]one of the best things about this hotel though is the staff.[SEP]nothing was too much trouble and everyone was so friendly, in particular quency.[SEP]we wanted to go out for dinner but unfortunately several of the restaurants we liked were either closed or fully booked, however quency went out of his way to find a lovely restaurant for us and then brought champagne to our room before we left which was much appreciated![SEP]we enjoyed our stay here so much and i would thoroughly recommend this hotel - we didn't want to leave!
4 7	we arrived tired and jaded early in the morning from a flight from barcelona - fully expecting that our rooms would not be ready.[SEP]they were![SEP]beautiful big bed with miles of pillows and wonderful linen - gorgeous bathroom and product that was restocked three times in 24 hours.[SEP]plus my room was cleaned fully 4 hours after i arrived.[SEP]enormous room with marvellous view - and great location.[SEP]lovely welcomne choccies and fluffy toy.[SEP]lovely big pool, fantastic reflexology massage, excellent service throughout.[SEP]i will be staying here again when in singapore - it was heavenly!
5	we stayed here in reliance on ta reviews, which have been quite accurate in the past all over the world.[SEP]prepared for a charming, homey place, we immediately knew we had chosen badly when we saw exterior and lobby.[SEP]tacky and shabby.[SEP]maybe ok for a business traveler on a budget.[SEP]breakfast was dismal, with boxed cereal and some yoghurt.[SEP]bad location for anything but business.[SEP]manager was very nice and quite helpful.[SEP]internet was free and worked well.
4	we stayed at the mgm in september of 2008.[SEP]the hotel was nice, rooms were very small but clean.[SEP]but it took us a good 10 min walk to get to the pool.[SEP]the hotel is way too big.[SEP]also we weren't a fan of the location.[SEP]we ate at the mexican restaurant and the food was terrible.[SEP]they had fresh guacamole as an appetizer that was great, other than that the food was awful.[SEP]we stayed at the mirage this year and loved it,
3 5	marriott rive gauche is a business conference hotel, so if you're looking for a charming experience in paris, this is not really what the hotel provides.[SEP]it caters more to large tour groups or businesspeople.[SEP]however, it does have some things going for it: clean and recently renovated, the famous marriott beds, lovely view of the butte montmartre and sacre coeur, and a good breakfast spread.[SEP]what i didn't like was that the rooms were extremely small, the location in the 14th arrondissement is quite remote, the soulless feeling of a conference hotel, and the tiny, windowless gym.[SEP]also, the staff weren't terribly well - trained: long waits at breakfast for coffee ; they kept removing the extra bathrobe which we'd requested because there were 2 guests in the room ; bottled sparkling water arrived without a bottle - opener.[SEP]if you are using your marriott points to redeem a holiday, as i was doing and as it seems most tourist guests to this hotel do, i would consider the renaissance vendome instead, which is a far better hotel in terms of quality and location, and only one category (category 7) more expensive.
5 6	i went to las vegas for the first time in my life and i heard from some of my friends about circus circus in las vegas so i decided to book my hotel there.[SEP]i was in las vegas on july 30th for 3 nights in a standard room located in the manor buildings, which is in a separate building through which you have to exit the lobby and go to the other building which is on the other side of the street.[SEP]the room itself was spacious.[SEP]it was a room with two queen beds.[SEP]there are no honor bar amenities, just an empty fridge to store your cool stuff.[SEP]the location itself is very far than what i would think.[SEP]circus circus is located on the strip but is far from when the action is which is down by the mirage, treasure island area.[SEP]overall, i think that the hotel is fine for a place to sleep but don't expect too much out of it.
4	the westin boston waterfront is a lovely hotel.[SEP]its public areas and rooms are decorated beautifully.[SEP]the staff was professional, the gym was well - equipped, and the room was spotless and nicely furnished.[SEP]my 10th floor room, overlooking the harbor in the distance, was also very quiet.[SEP]the only minor complaints regarding this hotel is that the room service food was not up to par (really - i had better food in the sioux falls, sd holiday inn last month!) and the hotel's location.[SEP]i was in boston for work so didn't mind the travel necessary to reach downtown - it was further than i had expected, though.[SEP]there are few restaurants (most of them pricey) within walking distance, so you generally need to taxi downtown to really enjoy boston.[SEP]if you are in boston for pleasure, i suggest you book downtown because it is a fantastic city to walk around in - beautiful architecture, wonderful shopping and great dining.[SEP]this is my third stay in boston and i still have to recommend the marriot copley (see review) as my favorite - both for convenience and service.[SEP]i would, however, stay here again if i was in town for business.
4	the hotel had average, clean rooms and comfortable linens.[SEP]we had an expedia deal that included free breakfast - a nice bonus - in the hotel restaurant, au bon pain.[SEP]parking was cheap - $10 a day with in / out privileges.[SEP]there is no free wifi in the rooms, only in the lobby.[SEP]the location was not good at all.[SEP]sort of in the ghetto.[SEP]there was absolutely nothing around except the u - mass campus and jfk library.[SEP]no shopping or restaurants.[SEP]you need to take the subway to go anywhere, and the nearby subway stop is a bit creepy.[SEP]i personally wouldn't feel comfortable going to that stop alone.[SEP]the hotel offers a free shuttle to downtown about every 4 hours which you need to make a reservation for.[SEP]we never took it because it didn't drop off where we wanted to go.[SEP]if you do decide to stay here, it is kind of difficult to find at first.[SEP]here's a clue - follow the signs to the expo center - it's right next door.
2	this was our first trip to playa del carmen although we've been vacationing in cancun for years.[SEP]the royal pdc is an all - inclusive resort located just off pdc's main tourist area of 5th ave.[SEP]the beach front location is very scenic and if there's anything not included, you don't need it.[SEP]even the " books to read " carts have sun lotions for every type of skin.[SEP]with everything included from whatever beverage you desire to outstanding food in any of their seven " themed " restaurants, you'll want for nothing.[SEP]particularly noteworthy, is the personal concierge located near our room ; she helped us with information, reservations, transportation and any other subject that came to mind.[SEP]we haven't run into that level of service before and is a great reason to go back.[SEP]the one complaint i might have would be that the food / drink was so good at the royal we didn't get a chance to try out any of the numerous inviting open - air establishments on 5th ave -- maybe next visit as we're definitely going back.
4	my wife and i spent 3 nights here over memorial day weekend.[SEP]the room was lovely- it was fairly roomy (not too familiar with standard " european " hotels vs.[SEP]american ones with a fabulous bathroom and a tub we could both fit in.[SEP]the climate control system worked great.[SEP]the location is perfect, especially if the art museums are your main focus as the thyssen is across the street, the prado is down one block, and the reina sofia is a 15 min.[SEP]walk.[SEP]the metro is a 10 min walk (wish it was just a bit closer, but really isn't bad) and the city center is a 20 min walk or 2 stops on the metro.[SEP]the concierge staff was fabulous and really went out of their way.[SEP]it is a terrific hotel- only downside is the steep price, but having got the room at a reduced rate on priceline, it was more than worth what we paid.
0 1	we have stayed at roman spa many times and have enjoyed it every time.[SEP]our stay last weekend was especially nice because the new manager seems to be giving the place an extra special presence, and it gives the place an nice edge.[SEP]the ever present flowers looked wonderful even in the heart of winter![SEP]and of corse the mineral waters were great, (the reason we go), also glad the spa is now part of the resort.[SEP]maybe in the future we could pay for both, room and spa in one location?
4	i go to florida every couple of years for the parks and to shop etc.[SEP]this time we thought we'd try our luck at parc soleil instead of staying at the grand vacations club on international drive (tuscany) - big mistake.[SEP]we had a studio for 3 days then a penthouse 1 bed for 3 days over new years.[SEP]the studio was really noisy, could hear every word from the neighbours, the accommodation, whilst clean was nt anywhere near as spacious as at international drive, fridge even smaller(if that were possible).[SEP]the one bedroom was great, complete contrast (we had a view out the back and it was quiet) the problem for me is the location - yeah its close to disney but not close to anything else and its just does nt have a warm friendly atmosphere to it as tuscany does.[SEP]the food is better, the shop and the restaurant but the pool looks dated, if you have a view over the flat roof and across onto the pool, it looks awful.[SEP]the water slide now looks very dated and overall i think for a property just a few years old it is already starting to look tired.[SEP]the build quality (noise) and the internal fittings are just not u to scratch i think.[SEP]i wo nt be going there again - ever.
0 14	the location was great but the hotel itself was so - so.[SEP]the room cleaning was not up to par with other hotels.[SEP]a dirty wine glass was left in our room for two days, so i put it in the hallway where it stayed for another two days.[SEP]they replaced a dirty water glass with a clean one, but didn't take the dirty one.[SEP]the view from our room left alot to be desired.[SEP]if looking at air conditioning units is your thing, stay here.[SEP]the air conditioning is motion sensored by the door, which was horrible in 110 degree heat.[SEP]when we walked into our room, it was 79 degrees.[SEP]not a cool temperature for when you have been walking outside.[SEP]the cafe in the hotel was overpriced, understaffed, and, the food was bland.[SEP]the buffet was good with a variety of different foods.[SEP]the casino slots were very tight, but the beverage service was frequent and abundant![SEP]the pool area was great because it had little water sprayers to cool you off in the hot vegas sun.[SEP]would i stay here again?[SEP]i would for the location on the strip but not for the service.
0 0 2	this location is not right next to the other 4 or 5 stars hotel such as the fairmont and right on the edge of the more questionable area of vancouver.[SEP]when you look out your window, you will see some very interesting shops and businesses.[SEP]it is quite far from robson street but completely doable.[SEP]this hotel definitely needs a facelift and the staff claimed it will happen in the next few years.[SEP]the rooms are clean but definitely not worthy of 4 stars.[SEP]the price is somewhat high for what you get.[SEP]but, the service i received, almost, made up for the oudated rooms and location.[SEP]we met w/ genalia in the hospitality suite and she was incredibly gracious and decent.[SEP]in fact, most of the staff were really great.[SEP]although, there are a couple front desk staff that were not as warm and friendly as they could be.[SEP]the hotel has this really weird open table check in / out area and i really disliked it.[SEP]it must have been some kind of experiment in the past to be closer to their guests.[SEP]but, i find it really annoying to be standing so close to the person checking me in or out of the hotel.[SEP]i hope they change that configuration when the remodel.
0	the hotel is on a quiet road right behind the debenhams on oxford st so the location is perfect for a shopping weekend.[SEP]bond st is the nearest tube and it was no more than a 5minute walk from there.[SEP]we arrived at 11.30am on saturday and we pleased to find that we could check in there and then.[SEP]reception staff were friendly.[SEP]the hotel is fairly small with only one lift but we never had to wait long.[SEP]our twin room on the 3rd floor was fairly small but lacked for nothing.[SEP]the bathroom was excellent with a very powerful shower.[SEP]everything was very clean, no complaints at all.[SEP]the breakfast buffet was good, although some things could have been a little warmer.[SEP]good selection of fruits, pastries, cereals etc if you didn't want to go for the full cholesterol overloaded full english![SEP]overall, would recommend to anyone looking for a quiet, centrally located hotel.
3	we had a very nice stay at the hotel.[SEP]it was very clean and the rooms were pretty nice.[SEP]our floor had a balcony attached to each window and the bathrooms were a great size.[SEP]the location is in a cute area and you would never know how close you are to the red light district.[SEP]the metro is just around the corner but not part of a central line-- very good if you don't mind a few changes.... disney is about an hour + away.[SEP]the italian restaurant around the corner was fantastic and we enjoyed our walk to sacre couer.[SEP]there is no air conditioning so i don't know how it would be in hot weather and internet is a separate fee per day.[SEP]all in all we really enjoyed the hotel!
3 5	this is not a four - star, fancy hotel where you will be pampered.[SEP]it is a living piece of history and its charm comes from knowing that the hotel is historic and has seen some amazing things.[SEP]the rooms are nice and clean.[SEP]definitely not fancy, but you are also not paying that much (considering its location).[SEP]if you want a hotel with real charm that is clean and simple, this is your best bet![SEP]there are a few great bars nearby and its central location in the city is wonderful.
0 4 7	i had read all of the reviews and was dreading my stay at the hotel pennsylvania but was very surprised with how great it turned out to be.[SEP]i am a reservation agent for 4 and 5 star hotels so know good quality and the hotel penn was not the greatest but i would definatley give it more than a 2 star rating.[SEP]we stayed on the 13th floor in a pennsylvannia 5000 king room.[SEP]the view sucked but the bed was huge and fairly comfy.[SEP]the breakfast each morning was an added bonnus for just $150 a night and the location was amazing.[SEP]you could nt ask for anything closer to all attractions![SEP]the bathrooms desperatley need renovating and are extremley small but other than that we had a great experiance.[SEP]no bed bugs, check - in staff were great, security was fantastic, and i ca nt say enough about how great the location is![SEP]people really need to lighten up on this 2 star hotel, it definatley exceeded my expectations and if people want 4 and 5 star they need to learn that they will be stuck paying the price.[SEP]you ca nt get 5 star hotels in new york for $150.[SEP]would highly reccomend this hotel to anyone looking to travel on a budget!
5	stayed here with my husband to celebrate my birthday thanks to a 3 day comp![SEP]what a lovely hotel stay![SEP]room on 37th floor overlooked the wynn... view of mountains, golf course was beautiful.[SEP]the room was immaculate and luxurious.[SEP]staff from checkin to housekeeping was professional, efficient and friendly.[SEP]location was great.... easy to walk from palazzo to venetian without going outside and the other hotels were easy to walk to![SEP]shopping and restaurants were great![SEP]loved the grand lux cafe for late night and breakfast food![SEP]even gambling wasn't bad... actually won $500 on slots there although table limits were too high for me![SEP]overall if you want a wonderful experience... the palazzo is the place
5	this is an older building, poor soundproofing & old slide - up windows (our room's window did not lock, and only on the second floor).[SEP]it seems like an old dorm or old apartment with plaster walls and wood floors that resonate every sound and every person walking down the hallway shakes the place.[SEP]our suite was clean and had a small kitchen.[SEP]front desk staff was pleasant.[SEP]there's a shuttle to downtown.[SEP]location is awkward however if you are seeking to walk to downtown or capitol hill.[SEP]if you get a good deal, not so bad.
0	this is the perfect location, the hotel is clean, the beds comfy, the views from the deck awesome, the staff alert and helpful, plenty of restaurants around, lots to see and do within walking distance, the public transit is free in the downtown area for a little further jaunts, lots of unique shops to explore, lots of architectural details on the buildings, lots of green spaces, lots of good seafood, jazz, chocolate and coffee.[SEP]great day trips from here too.
0 0	great location, poor hotel the hotel is in a great location but that is about the nicest thing i can write about it.[SEP]rooms are dark and dingy with non existent air conditioning.[SEP]kids room had blood splattered insects over the walls and bedding - yuk.[SEP]front desk staff very grumpy and unhelpful food at breakfast was nasty, cheapest quality everythingparking is 26 euro's per night which we felt was very steep and not mentioned on the site we had booked through
0	my experience at the holiday inn was, the hotel is a good location, the girl at the front deck wasn't very nice, our room was on the 6th floor, had to use 2 lifts & a long walk.[SEP]the room was clean, but very dark.
1	this place has it all - great location, friendly staff, beautiful rooms, nice breakfast.[SEP]the location is so central to everything we wanted - opera metro, galeries lafayette for shopping, hop on hop off tour bus, walk to the louvre and the ritz for high tea, and loads of nice restaurants.[SEP]rooms are cosy and immaculately clean, and it was pretty quiet at night considering it was in the middle of everything.[SEP]we were given easy instructions to make our own way to versaille which saved us a fortune.[SEP]we loved staying at the hotel gramont and look forward to staying there again next time in paris.
2 3	i have to take my hat off to premier inn (i was a fan already).[SEP]i stayed here on only their second night since opening and it was more or less faultless.[SEP]add a location only yards away from the biggest shopping mall in london (or is it england or europe - papers can't decide) with views over the emerging olympic park and you can't ask for much more.[SEP]stratford is close to the centre of london and canary wharf and the price was good
1 13 13	we stayed in this hotel during the weekend of the boston marathon.[SEP]location was not ideal for the marathon, but once we figured out the t, it was fine.[SEP]in better weather, it is only a mile or so to walk to all the boston attractions.[SEP]the silver line t (world trade center stop) is very close.[SEP]the room was beautiful and was exactly as pictured.[SEP]the bathroom was very nice with granite countertop, a robe, and nice big towels.[SEP]the bed was extremely comfortable - best hotel bed i've been in.[SEP]service was great, especially for the large crowd staying there.[SEP]the gym was very nice with lots of machines.[SEP]pool was a little small, but nice.[SEP]room service food was so - so, but the food in the lobby with the bar service looked awesome.[SEP]the bar was really nice and they even had a guy making sushi.[SEP]i would definitely stay here again.[SEP]it's not the best location if you want to have all the boston attractions right outside your door, but i liked having the big hotel with all the amenities and didn't mind the location.
3	cheap stay so if your prepared probably not the worst place![SEP]had a 4 night stay with some friends, room on the first floor to the front of the building.[SEP]windows didn't shut properly so it was really noisy, and the bathroom needed a right good clean![SEP]not a great location overall.[SEP]staff were very good.
2	nice place.[SEP]we've stayed here once before.[SEP]my only complaints are the location (especially when silver dollar city busy as you have to wait in their traffic to get back to your hotel), lack of housekeeping services and early check - out (who ever heard of a 10 o'clock check - out?).[SEP]additionally, cell phone service was not available from our room and you had to sign in to the wi - fi everytime you wanted to use it- multiple times in same day.[SEP]our room last time (higher priced) had a fireplace and that was nice.
0	hotel is an excellent location for visiting universal and for hitting the hollywood sites.[SEP]the rooms were very nice, large bathrooms.[SEP]the staff was very courteous and attentive.[SEP]they brought a basket of fruit our first night, which was nice.[SEP]i only have a couple of complaints: the prices in the restaurant and the wait for elevators.[SEP]we did not eat at the hilton as there are more reasonable places to eat at citywalk across the street.[SEP]we did buy coffee in the coffee bar and it was great.[SEP]it took an especially long time to get an elevator.[SEP]there may have been two elevators inoperable, not sure, but we never saw them working.
8	i stayed here at the tail end of a business trip because i had an early flight out the next morning.[SEP]the positives: the shuttle will pick you up at the rental car return so you can avoid the car shuttle to the aiport.[SEP]front desk staff were very helpful with my questions.[SEP]the not so positives: even though i requested a room away from road traffic, my sleep was disturbed by highway traffic all night as i was on a side of the building.[SEP]be prepared.[SEP]the shuttle only runs on the half hour.[SEP]if you call at 8:05, the driver will pick you up on his next run --- when he leaves the hotel at 8:30.[SEP]it is a 10 minute ride.[SEP]the location was literally in a business park with no restaurants or amenities around the area.[SEP]you are paying for the room, that's it.[SEP]no coffeee available until 5 am in the lobby.[SEP]this hotel served my purpose but i will stay somewhere else next time.
4	we read reviews, looked at maps, and asked friends who had traveled to seattle.[SEP]the mayflower park hotel was an easy and wise choice for us.[SEP]returning from a l0-day cruise, we needed a comfortable, well - located place to spend a few days.[SEP]we were not disappointed.[SEP]our room was an upgrade, everyone associated with the hotel was extremely helpful, and the location allowed us to do all of the things we had planned for our seattle get - a - way.
0	location: far off the strip.[SEP]a free bus will take you along the strip but it is always crowded.[SEP]walking from the stratosphere to the other end of the strip is extremely tiresome: beware in summer the strip is extremely dusty, las vegas is located in a desert after all.[SEP]rooms: very good value for money, very big rooms with great views.[SEP]one show or ride is included in the hotel price, which is always good in las vegas.[SEP]casino: average.
7 10	i've used tripadvisor for 5 years now and it's never let me down.... until now.[SEP]we stayed in the garden wing and i have to say it all felt very dated.[SEP]the room itself was " ok " but the bathroom looked old fashioned and the whole balcony area, front doors and the general presentation looked very tired.[SEP]the walls of the garden wing were a very off - white and badly in need of a new paint job.[SEP]funnily enough, on our last day we noticed they had started doing just that.[SEP]the food was very good with lots of selection but on our final day (a saturday) we were horrified when we went down to the restaurant to get a table only to be told they were fully booked![SEP]we couldn't believe that as guests of the hotel we had to book a table![SEP]the gym was quite good and the pool was of a decent standard but the other major issue we had was the location of the hotel.[SEP]it's a good 15 minute taxi ride to the city centre so if you're only staying in singapore for a short period of time i would nt recommend this hotel.[SEP]furthermore, it's not cheap and i didn't feel we got value for money.[SEP]would not stay here next time.
1	we only stayed one night.[SEP]the location was great and the premises was beautiful.[SEP]the room was a typical hotel room but was decent, clean and spacious enough for our needs.[SEP]we were given a first floor room next to the pool.[SEP]it was relatively quiet.[SEP]the staff were informative and friendly.[SEP]the daily parking was a total rip - off at $20/day but i would think that the rates are similar anywhere else you stay on the island.[SEP]all in all, it was a good enough stay.
1 16	we went to new york to see the sights.[SEP]the hotel is in a fantastic location.[SEP]we stayed on the 16th floor and looking out of the window you could see central park to our right and times square to our left.[SEP]the room was quite small but that didn't bother us as we only wanted to sleep in it, we were out of the room all day, most of the days.[SEP]it was a bit out dated and some of the wallpaper was peeling off.[SEP]the bathroom was basic and again could have done with some updating.[SEP]the room however had air con which was great because it was quite sticky and humid out.[SEP]the room was quiet enough to get a good nights sleep when the window was shut.[SEP]our only complaint was when we left the' do not disturb' sign on the door, the housekeeping maid opened our door and quickly shut it.[SEP]we then had a phonecall asking if we wanted service.[SEP]i'm sure that's what the' do not disturb' sign means.[SEP]another day we heard the door being fiddled with and when we opened it, the maid said' i was just checking'.[SEP]checking for what i don't know.[SEP]there is a subway station right outside the side entrance to the hotel on 55 street.[SEP]the lobby area was lovely.[SEP]i don't know if i would stay here again because i like to try lots of different hotels.[SEP]in summary as a base for all sightseeing / shopping it is a great location.
4	although there was an hour and half wait for the in - room internet to be fixed, it was free so i can't really complain.[SEP]if the mattress was a little softer and the sheets were made to stay on the mattress for the duration of the night, i wouldn't have anything else to complain about.[SEP]check in staff were very pleasant and willing to please.[SEP]room was clean, ample amenities and good value for money if you can get one of the special offers.[SEP](i.e under seventy) i would stay here again as its location it great for a weekend away and some retail therapy in the huge attached florida mall.
0	great location, 2 minute walk to metro to take you everywhere.[SEP]did not eat there, many little restaurants in the area and yes, 2 starbucks within a few minutes of the hotel.[SEP]friendly staff and a nice room for paris standards (small).[SEP]the bed took up most of the space with little room for luggage.[SEP]short walk to notre dam and the seine where i suggest you get a ticket for the hop on - hop off batabus (river boat) that takes you to the major tourist sights.[SEP]short walk, even with luggage to the metro and rer.[SEP]taxi not necessary.[SEP]many restaurant options in the area, great place for people watching and enjoying a real paris neighborhood.[SEP]would look there first to book a room when we return.
3	booked directly through mgmmirage vacations.[SEP]the room was clean and spacious (loved the tv built in to the bathroom mirror!).[SEP]would've been nice to have a kettle / coffee machine in the room.[SEP]free on - site parking ; perfect location on the strip ; everything you want to see and do is so close.[SEP]loved it.
7	pros: - we got a room for $45 though priceline.[SEP]- our room had two double beds and a big desk and everything (including bathroom) looked clean.[SEP]it faced the highway but the noise level was minimum.[SEP]- wireless internet worked perfectly.[SEP]- the parking is at the back of the hotel and isn't free ($8?[SEP]per night) but is covered and you won't get wet getting there even if it's raining.[SEP]- the front desk staff was very friendly and allowed us to check in early since the room was available and our 3-year - old was asleep in the car and needed a better place to sleep.[SEP]cons: - the location is ok if you have a car but there isn't much around the hotel.[SEP](15 mintes walk to skytrain station, i was told) - our room key cards didn't work... or it didn't seem to work, and we had to make a few trips to the front desk (and they would remagnetize the cards) till a guy came up to help.[SEP]he showed us how to open the door..[SEP]he told my husband to slide the card in and out very slowly, and it was helpful piece of info, but i felt the way he said it and behaved was kind of patronizing and rude.[SEP]- no fridge.
11	the day before i arrived, i called ahead to ask the manager to save 2 rooms close together for my friend and me.[SEP]he took my name and number and said he would call right back, he never did.[SEP]my room was so small i thought it was a joke.[SEP]there was no closet, but hangers on the lamp.[SEP]eventually i was " upgraded ", and i use that term loosely.[SEP]this room was right over the nightclub.[SEP]five stories up and it felt like the band was in the room.[SEP]i kept checking to see if the window was open it was so loud.[SEP]there was no ny or london times, or l'occitane products as advertised.[SEP]the towels were threadbare and looked like something you'd see at the y.[SEP]the elevators were very slow.[SEP]the location was good, and some of the staff did try.[SEP]but for the price, i would stay elsewhere.
8	we stayed at the ida hotel in early april.[SEP]we made a booking last minute through booking.com and were surprised when we received an email from the hotel staff asking whether we needed to be picked up at the airport.[SEP]we did and that went very smoothly.[SEP]the staff at the hotel were super nice to us throughout our stay.[SEP]in fact, we felt like we were staying with some distant relatives that we've met for the first time - the atmosphere was friendly and informal.[SEP]the room was clean, quite small, and there was a lot of noise coming from the street at night and from a construction site nearby in the morning.[SEP]however, i think that it's just a part of staying in sultanahmet - it's going to be noisy.[SEP]the breakfast was minimal, but fresh (3 types of cheese, veggies, olives, fresh bread and tea).[SEP]the location of the hotel was perfect, we walked to many historical sites, and there were plenty of dining options.[SEP]in other words, it's a great home base when you are exploring all day and are not at the hotel too much.
4	excellent stay.[SEP]the staff were very friendly, the room was just what we needed -- nothing huge, and maybe small for some, but this is why i stay in the boutique hotels.[SEP]i don't need a big box room.[SEP]everything was clean and well thought out.[SEP]location was great -- easy to walk down to the wharf and also over to the f line street car.[SEP]also near some convince stores, starbucks, etc.[SEP]i continue to be happy with my stays at the kimpton properties.[SEP]definitely recommend.
2	after reading many reviews of this property i wasn't expecting much, but i was pleasantly surprised.[SEP]we arrived at 9:45 am and asked if we could leave our bags there until check in, they gave us a room right away..[SEP]the location and view was amazing, right across the street from the bayside market place and close to the beaches.[SEP]i loved everythings about it.[SEP]thank you holiday inn, we loved miami and your hotel.
1	i liked the hotel ruskin, granted it's not swanky but it served it's purpose.[SEP]the location is great, the price was amazing and granted to room was small but what more do you need?[SEP]i wasn't planing on staying in my room on my visit to london.[SEP]the sheets were clean and the bed was comfy.[SEP]i was right next to the british museum, how can you beat that for 59 pounds a nite?[SEP]i didn't get a chance to make it to breakfast but i did wander down to the breakfast room, it was nice.[SEP]clean and cute.[SEP]i felt very safe in the hotel and i'm a single female traveler, not once did i feel scared.[SEP]the bathroom sharing thing was a new experience to me but i didn't mind.[SEP]i had no trouble getting in when i needed to use the facilities and it was very clean.[SEP]as in any place you take a public shower, you just wear some flip flops, no big deal.[SEP]i would stay there again on my next trip to london.
1	i trust and rely ontrip advisor reviews and this is the first of a dozen times that it steered me to a very poor hotel.[SEP]this hotel is in a terrible location.[SEP]the only thing you can really walk to it a dirty gift shop and waffle house.[SEP]the complaint of not being able to get into the hotel when returning from disney is valid and an enormous hassle.[SEP]the first opportunity to make a u - turn is a half mile down the road in stop and go traffic.[SEP]after a day at the parks with small children, this can be an excruciating 20 + minute wait.[SEP]however, the worst part of this stay was when my $600 nikon camera was stolen at the pool when i was there with my kids.[SEP]the front desk staff refused to assist in any way.[SEP]they have security cameras and pool key swipe cards that could have been checked but they acted like i was bothering them by even asking.[SEP]they refused to let me hang a small sign in the pool area.[SEP]every picture from the trip and from the month prior were lost.[SEP]the prices at this hotel are good but they definitly draw a different crowd from other disney hotels.[SEP]i would recommend people look at the hilton or other hotels along the downtown disney hotel zone.[SEP]we didn't go inside the hilton but it looked very nice and the location was awesome (you could easily walk to downtown disney).
2	we booked this last minute and rather blindly.[SEP]in retrospect spring training is not the bes time to look for " deals " in phoenix, but we grossly overpaid for the quality of the property (even for a busy time) at about $200/night after all taxes and fees ($405 total for friday and saturday).[SEP]the location is pretty much out in the middle of nowhere -- right on the highway.[SEP]it somewhat worked for us because we were all over the city as well as most of the surrounding suburbs.[SEP]getting anywhere nice for dinner was a minimum 20 minute drive (conservatively).[SEP]not to insult holiday inn, but that's more the level this property performed at.[SEP]the highs: staff was great (except for the valet that never showed up to park the car, but garage parking is a 90 second stroll and probably easier) providing some great restaurant recommendations -- don't miss marcellino's!!!![SEP]balcony faced the mountains at sunset, but obstructed by highway lights.[SEP]room decor was about what was expected from a sheraton.[SEP]the lows: our room faced the highway.[SEP]even with the thick drapes closed it was nearly impossible to get to sleep due to the highway noise.[SEP]although exactly what i've seen in other sheraton properties, the colors in the bathroom seem a little more outdated.[SEP]the tile around the tub was mid-1980's at best (an irritating pinkish - orange to match the marble of the sink).[SEP]the worst part had to be the mold in the grout.[SEP]nice touch...
0	i recently organized a 10 day group stay for 14 families attending the junior gold championships and the stay at gatehouse was better then i could have imagined.[SEP]from the start, gretchen, (group sales) did everything possible to make this a fantastic stay:, the group was put in the same location, all special requests for room locations were perfect and at check - in all guests were greeted with a wonderful welcome letter and a warm cookie.[SEP]the rooms were great... clean, comfortable and had all we needed for a home away from home.[SEP]the housekeeping staff kept the rooms spotless.[SEP]after returning from a long day of competition the kitchen was spotless, dishes in the dishwasher were clean and our beds were all ready to climb in.[SEP]they served breakfast daily and a light dinner 4 nights a week.[SEP]it was great to come back and have a cold beer and/or glass of wine ready for you.[SEP]the only downfall at breakfast was the eggs but they were really no different then any other scrambled eggs that are left to stay hot over a sterno.[SEP]finally, there was omar... the everything man!!![SEP]the dishwasher leaked one night, omar came running, anything the kids asked for omar came running.[SEP]by the end of our stay the entire staff made us fell like family.[SEP]we are all still taking about the trip and omar a month later.
7	there are many hotels in sf and i travel here often, so i thought i would try the w.[SEP]well, the hotel is cool, and the rooms are decent but i will not select this hotel again.[SEP]it's just not woth the extra money when you can stay at many similar styled hotels that cost much less in the city.[SEP]the staff is excellent and i did like that they will deliver a coffee maker to your room and another good thing about the room is a long desk with plenty of plugs.[SEP]i do wish more hotels would think of female travelers and have more plugs in the restroom.[SEP]the air in the room never really got very cool.[SEP]at 4 am noisy people in the hallway, cheap small little travel hair dryer (come on).[SEP]the location is not that great but i did walk about a third of a mile to the nearest starbucks.[SEP]the walk was nice but the neighborhood is a little sketchy.[SEP]a little difficult to find the valet parking and the parking is over $45 a night and the one thing that just got me was a tiny bottle of water in the bathroom that was $6.[SEP]that is just ridiculous as it was probably around 8ozs.[SEP]they could make money and charge half that much and not looked so greedy..[SEP]that just really erked me even though i wouldn't buy it at $3.
1	i would not recommend this hotel if staying in paris.[SEP]the location is just not central.[SEP]everything is at least 20 minutes in the metro and there is nt anything to do in the vicinity of the hotel.[SEP]booked it on lastminute.com as a last resort.[SEP]it was disguised as a' top secret' hotel.[SEP]the room was basic and the hotel in general would not intice anyone to hang around there for anything other than sleep.[SEP]if i was going again i would stay somewhere more in central paris as i think it makes a big difference to your stay.
2	this hotel was an excellent deal, a really good price through late rooms.[SEP]we were really pleased, lovely hotel just one minute from tower hill tube station.[SEP]great location for visiting london.[SEP]we arrived very early and were able to leave our bags securely with the concierge.[SEP](in fact we were allowed to leave bags with the concierge all day on the day we checked out).[SEP]the room was lovely, small like most london hotels but really comfortable, great bed, large and clean with nice linen and washroom cosmetics.[SEP]the ac was great and black out curtains made the stay comfortable and quiet.[SEP]only downside you have to pay for wifi......[SEP]this should be free in a 5 start hotel.[SEP]we would definitely stay there again though, we visit london frequently and this is the best hotel we have stayed at for this price.
6	i booked this hotel for a night while our us navy ship was in town for the seattle sea fair.[SEP]i e - mailed management after booking a reservation through a third party because i had read some negative reviews with regards to room quality when booking this way.[SEP]i just wanted to make sure that the room had two queen beds as i was sharing the room with a shipmate.[SEP]mr.[SEP]battersby of management responded that all was good.[SEP]when we arrived we could not have been more pleased, the hotel treated us great and even upgraded our room.[SEP]the bed was comfortable, linens were clean and fresh, pillows perfect and the location of the hotel is in easy walking distance of the pikes place market and other shopping.[SEP]a short bus ride or the monorail will get you to the space needle.[SEP]all in all a great stay for a couple of tired sailors wanting to get on shore for a few days and sleep in a comfortable bed for the night.[SEP]thanks for the great hospitality.[SEP]us navy chief
1	average the cosomoplitan hotel was picked on price through expedia.[SEP]i should have checked its location as it was a 15 minute walk to the nearest metro.[SEP]the hotel itself was ok, and was value for money.
1	if i was coming to downtown orlando for business i would stay here.[SEP]however, i came for a weekend with my husband and i found that the downtown location was not conveniant to parks and other active locations.[SEP]parking is awful, you might as well valet which is pricey.[SEP]the room was large and nice, and the staff was nice (a few a little pretentious).[SEP]honestly felt self conscious because we were dressed casuelly for travel and the staff and other travelers were very dressed up.
10	doesn't disappoint.[SEP]but oh those elevators we have stayed here 4 times now and still love the marquis.[SEP]we had good service from front desk, in lounge, and from housekeeping.[SEP]admittedly we weren't there all that long this time so didn't use all services.[SEP]but nothing beats the 8 fl lounge for nice cocktails, maybe the cheese platter, and a fantastic view of times square.[SEP]you can also get literally anywhere you want to go in just minutes from this hotel.[SEP]i did call the concierge for show tickets as i was told they can do that, but they forwarded me to a ticket service without saying that was what they were doing.[SEP]the marquis is also pretty overpriced.[SEP]we paid about $550/ni and it is nothing more than a nice marriott room.[SEP]but we did have a nice flat screen tv, plenty of room, and a view of times square.[SEP]so we just swallow the cost and enjoy the superb location, nice room, and good service.[SEP]the only thing is tha tthis trip the elevators were horrible.[SEP]we had thought since they put in the new elevator system it was better, but we almost were late for a show after waiting sooooo long for an elevator.[SEP]when one finally came to our floor we just squeezed in and held our breath.[SEP]i would stay again.[SEP]and hope the price doesn't go up....
1 10	i stayed at the hotel for a conference.[SEP]i am a frequent traveler and have stayed at a wide range of hotels including sheratons and my entire experience at this hotel was dreadful and unacceptable in every way possible.[SEP]i arrived to a 20 minute wait at the front desk to check in – then greeted by a frowning grumpy desk clerk who responded to my request for the elevator location with a wave of her hand and an “ over there ” pointing to who knows where.[SEP]my room was cold and remained that way for the entire stay.[SEP]attempts to contact the front desk regarding this met with a recording and an endless wait.[SEP]my television would not connect to the movie menu displaying a “ please wait message ” that never changed.[SEP]i stood in line to report this and my cold room and bathroom light issue but no repairs or resolution occurred.[SEP]the carpets in my room were badly stained and soiled, and the 3 light fixture over the vanity had only one functioning bulb.[SEP]the $7.00 cashews from the mini bar were stale, the line for coffee in the morning was a 20 minute wait and the coffee pot in my room was not working.[SEP]last but not least the conference rooms were freezing and the sponsors announced their apologies telling us the hotel was having heating issues.[SEP]i have never had such a dismal hotel experience
1	stayed here 2 nights.....[SEP]the location is good, as the subway stops are within a couple of blocks and it seemed quite safe to be out walking around, even at night......[SEP]as for the hotel, be prepared... this is a very old place.... they keep it up well as everything was clean, but it's still old![SEP]ask about the type of room you're getting... be specific... ours was very small.... especially the bathroom... i'm 5' 11 ", 190 lbs.[SEP]and believe me, anyone any larger would not be able to function in the bathroom... truth............ the elevator, only one, is extremely slow.... we were on the 7th floor (7 total) and it can take up to 10 mins.[SEP]to get it up there.... better off walking the stairs......[SEP]once you do get it, it's only big enough for 2 adults and 2 suitcases.....[SEP]you can hear the cables slapping as it operates... reminded me of an old horror movie scene... lol......[SEP]everything went fine and the employees were awesome... the only reason to stay here would be for price.....[SEP]2 nights $548.00... cheap for new york, but still expensive......[SEP]i'll probably spend more and stay elsewhere next time.......
8	hmmm... it is so hard to find.[SEP]we finally found it, but let me say their directions are not helpful.[SEP]look for a big wood door and the hotel name is one of the apt.[SEP]buzzers.[SEP]it is not clearly marked so be ready to be a bit frustrated.[SEP]the room was basic and looked at a cement wall.[SEP]had all our basic needs but definately nothing extra.[SEP]we were not informed of the breakfast at check on so we missed on day 1 and the would not serve early when we had to catch the train on our last day.[SEP]the location was not great.[SEP]the neighborhood wasn't bad, but it was not good either.[SEP]i would look for somewhere else next time.
2	the main reason for the' very good' rating is the rate: 140 euros for two including breakfast is excellent for central paris.[SEP]for that price you'd expect a youth hostel, and it's certainly not that.[SEP]however, beyond the fantastic front desk staff and the convenient location, there's not loads to recommend it.[SEP]design / look is rather 90s chintzy, some fixtures and fittings are worn or chipped, standard rooms are really small, the rooms are all crammed in together and the walls are very thin, so we could hear a neighbour opening a desk drawer (almost).[SEP]location is convenient rather than nice: it's on a boulevard populated by clothes wholesalers and electrical shops - but within minutes you can be on the rue de charonne walking to the marais, and it's a 5 - 10 minute cab ride to great bars, restaurants, museums etc.[SEP]so overall, a very good budget option, but i'm not sure it quite deserves its trip advisor ranking of one of the top 20 hotels of paris...!
4	recently stayed 6 days there.[SEP]staff was very friendly and helpful.[SEP]rooms were clean and quiet.[SEP]i would rate the beds as a 5 - not the worst i've slept in but not the best.[SEP]location is great.[SEP]pics of the room are a little exaggerated.[SEP]bathroom is tiny, small closet and no dressers (in the standard room) and the elevator is a joke.[SEP]we usually walked down from the 6th floor rather than wait.[SEP]if you are only interested in a place to sleep and shower, this works fine.
3	this hotel is indeed dated, with very old and shabby furniture, but if you look past that - and the slightly peeling wallpaper - it is very clean and comfortable.[SEP]the linens are all nice and the pillows are great.[SEP]the desk is not good for business travel, but i imagine most people staying at this place are not business travelers.[SEP]the price was the most reasonable i could find, but the location was sketchy enough that i took a cab downtown and back for dinner at night, and one morning when i had to meet people at 6 a.m. to go to grand isle.[SEP]by the way, the food i had the restaurant - crawfish linguini - was among of the best meals i've eaten in new orleans, but the service was absolutely terrible.
0	prime location, very good service perfectly located right next to the tokyo government offices and within walking distance of shinjuku station and the commercial shopping area of shinjuku.[SEP]the hotel is a large high rise.[SEP]check - in was speedy and efficient.[SEP]the room was very large by japanese standards with fabulous views of tokyo, spotlessly clean.[SEP]the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom well appointed with lots of toiletries, robes, slippers.[SEP]early morning check out was handled quickly, competently and politely.[SEP]not the cheapest but a very good base from which to get around tokyo.
1	this was our last hotel to visit on our two week holiday to california and what a disappointment.[SEP]location is terrible it is on the outskirts of san diego and unless you are visiting sea world there is nothing else close by.[SEP]there are no restaurants in walking distance except the hotel restaurant which looked nice but can not comment as we did not eat in it.[SEP]our room was very dull and musty smelling, our balcony had two ridiculous high chairs and a high table which were not inviting to sit on.[SEP]parking was 25 $a night to park your own car.[SEP]the two previous hotels we had stayed in were beautiful hotels with valet parking which were the same price.[SEP]the positive about this hotel is the pool is nice.[SEP]hope this review is helpful to people who like to be in the centre of places do not book this hotel.
4 6	i stayed at the hotel for 10 days for business in november.[SEP]luckily, the weather was chilly in phoenix for that time of year, so i had no use for the pool.[SEP]had the weather been warm as usual in phoenix, the pool would have been less than adequate.[SEP]it was small and located in a shady courtyard.[SEP]other than that, i had a great experience and really enjoyed this property and its' location.[SEP]the gym is also inadequate but they offer a $2 pass to the l.a fitness accross the street.[SEP]hotel is very close to shopping and even walking distance to a couple bars and restaurants.[SEP]also very close to camelback mountain.[SEP]the rooms are very nice, large and clean.[SEP]they are set up like a small apartment with a totally separate bedroom and almost full sized kitchen.[SEP]the free dinner and breakfast is a plus for long stays and is relatively good as free food goes.[SEP]i would definately stay in a homewood suites again
0	location was ok, next to a metro stop.[SEP]hotel was clean but plain.[SEP]rooms were spartan.[SEP]service pretty average.
1 4	stay far away from this one.... this hotel is not worthy of best western standards, and i am surprised that it is endorsed by best western.... upon arrival and check - in we discovered that the parking area is very cramped and the rooms are not air - conditioned.[SEP]because of the seedy area of town this hotel is located, you can not even open the locked windows to get some air.[SEP]the manager would only cancel our three night reservations for the subsequent nights forcing us to stay in a sweltering room for one night with no adjustment to the room rate.[SEP]i intend to find every travel website i can to warn other travelers to stay away from this hotel.[SEP]we rebooked the remainder of our reserved nights in san francisco at the best western grosvenor airport hotel, so you can see, we are not anit - best western... just very disappointed in the san francisco civic center location.
3 4 5 12	once you are inside, there isn't too much more you could ask for in a moderately priced hotel.[SEP]the staff is great, the place is clean, and there's a fitness room (sort of).[SEP]however, i can not honestly say that i consider it to be located in a safe neighborhood.[SEP]if you are coming to new orleans, spend a few dollars extra and stay closer to the river (sheraton, hilton, marriott, harrah's, doubletree, ritz carlton, crowne plaza, westin, wyndham, holiday inn, to name a few).[SEP]this quality inn is unfortunately a few blocks off of canal street (a main road) and too far inland (where there are less people and not alot of action).[SEP]the dark streets and shady characters can make a traveler a bit nervous at night.[SEP]if you want the full experience (bourbon street, decatur street, casino, river) the new orleans marriott or sheraton is probably in the best location.[SEP]the positives of this hotel are the price and the staff.[SEP]when i arrived (on an airport shuttle..[SEP]which, by the way, avoid![SEP]just split a cab with someone), my room was not ready so i was upgraded to a suite (two bedrooms, bathroom, sink, fridge) for no charge.[SEP]the staff was able to recommend places to eat and things to do, also.[SEP]i would rate the staff a 5, the hotel itself a 4 (considering price), and the location is maybe a 1.5 - 2.
0 1	globus tours switched our hotel at the last minute from a downtown location to the outskirts of rome -- the hotel villa pamphili.[SEP]located near a sprawling park the hotel does not lend itself to exploring any local restaurants, which are far away.[SEP]the swimming pool was under reconstruction.[SEP]many parts of the hotel needed updating.[SEP]i was disappointed in the service from the start.[SEP]the front desk staff questioned why we needed 3 extra pillows.[SEP]i said because we are 3 persons in need of 1 extra pillow each.[SEP]the response was.... we might not have enough pillows in the hotel (which was far from fully booked).[SEP]they ultimately did find pillows.[SEP]the internet connection in the business center was ancient, slow and overpriced.
4	we spent several days at the condado plaza recently.[SEP]i have the highest praise for their entire staff and the service we experienced![SEP]even though the hotel is in the midst of renovation, we were not inconvenienced in any way.[SEP]our large room had a beautiful view of the lagoon.[SEP]the location is so convenient - walking distance to good restaurants and a short cab ride to old san juan.[SEP]on my last day, i was in the business center printing our boarding passes, and left my cell phone by the printer.[SEP]the staff found it promptly.[SEP]when i called from the airport, they immediately dispatched someone to deliver it to me curbside.[SEP]this was an extra service they didn't have to provide and was much appreciated.[SEP]we will definitely stay at the condado plaza again on future trips to puerto rico.
1	i was surprised to see the fantastic reviews of this marriott since i had a totally different experience in my recent business stay in san diego.[SEP]the location of this courtyard is not what i would recommend for families, or any other travelers unless you are specifically going for nightlife.[SEP]my business associates and i were approached by a group of men demanding money on the street not even one block from the hotel around 11:00 p.m. we refused but there was a scene.[SEP]i would not want my family to encounter this on a trip to san diego.[SEP]the rooms were little and the bathroom even smaller.[SEP]the staff made an effort to enjoy themselves and acted friendly but they were not able to respond to simple requests at check in.
1	how can a room as small as a match box be called a suite.........[SEP]never stay here.... it may have a good location for the convention center.... but ther are lots of other v hotels and no need to stay here.[SEP]i have stayed in other embasssy suites canada andusa and this is the worst... just give it a miss........... not at any price.[SEP]no no no no
10	if you must stay in downtown, book the north tower even at the extra added cost.[SEP]very large flat screen tv and large room.[SEP]very comfy bed.[SEP]stayed in the south tower last year, and had to change rooms twice due to a leaking ceiling and floor.[SEP]ugh.[SEP]had it not been for our stay in the north tower, i don't think i would have ever gone back.[SEP]the italian restaurant here is w - o - n - d - e - r - f - u - l.[SEP]pasta was home made and food was very close to what we had in italy.[SEP]we only chose this place because we were too lazy to drive into town.[SEP]what a surprise this was![SEP]good location next to the premium outlet mall.
8 12	stayed the first 2 weeks in march, have stayed in other orlando hotels over the years, but none have been a patch on this hotel.[SEP]from check - in to check - out the staff were helpful and always friendly.[SEP]the atrium is a lovely setting for the complimentary breakfasts and evening drinks.[SEP]the room we had was on the top floor overlooking i-4, but this wasn't a disadvantage, as if we were in the room at the right times we had lovely sunsets and had great views of the finreworks at epcot and magic kingdom.[SEP]our room was very spacious and spotlessly clean, i couldn't fault it.[SEP]the complimentary breakfasts were very nice, the omelette station was lovely and very efficient, and the buffets were plentiful and fresh.[SEP]the complimentary drinks each evening were a nice added bonus, pleasant just to have a drink or two before we set out for dinner.[SEP]the queues were never long and the bar staff very friendly and efficient.[SEP]the location couldn't be faulted, at the better end of international drive and within easy walking distance of ample restaurants.[SEP]the choice of pools and hot tubs was nice with ample towels and loungers, never too crowded.[SEP]didn't get to use the fitness room, as we just didn't have the time.[SEP]we did however make use of the business centre.[SEP]i would definately stay here again.
10 11 12	i love staying at sheraton hotels.[SEP]this one was no different except for a few things: they do not tell you that you have to pay for parking (an extra$15/day, or valet for, i think $24).[SEP]the parking lot was in the back of the hotel so it was pretty far.[SEP]luckily, the weather was nice.[SEP]the interiors of the hotel were very nice: a little gift shop, a starbucks, nice rooms... bathroom too![SEP]staff were nice.[SEP]like always, my room key didn't work at one point and i had to go all the way downstairs to get it reloaded.[SEP]the concierge person took the time do it for me instead of having to wait in the line with the people needing to check in.[SEP]i did not like that sheraton would not let me add points to my rewards card though because i booked through hotwire.[SEP]the hotel is also very close to the airport (they have a shuttle)... so i could definitely hear airplane noise... not so bad though.[SEP]location wise, it was a pretty far drive to every where we had to go though.[SEP]that sucked.[SEP]l.a. traffic is bad.
3 4	traveling abroad is always an adventure.[SEP]on - line booking makes it easy, but can also create problems.[SEP]if you are planning a trip to paris, book your stay in this hotel.[SEP]price, room quality, service & location.[SEP]you won't be disappointed.
1	despite its name, this hotel is not in old town, nor is it very close.[SEP]it is in a very noisy location (by a busy hwy and train line), there are no restaurants nearby, or anywhere to go at night.[SEP]the rooms were aging (hair drying broken, a / c very noisy), and the pool does not include a hot tub, etc.[SEP]the wireless internet worked most of the time, but the 3rd party provider was rude when i did have problems.
8	stayed on the club floor.[SEP]issues checking in as we were given two beds although we ’d asked for a king room.[SEP]took ages to get the room sorted.[SEP]we were finally given a suite room, which was very comfortable and spacious.[SEP]club lounge is good.[SEP]free wifi in lounge but not in the club rooms, does n’t make sense to me.[SEP]free snacks all day and then drinks in the evening.[SEP]breakfast was available in the lounge too.[SEP]location is easy walking distance to orchard road.[SEP]this is the second time we have stayed here.[SEP]it is expensive for where it is but they often do specials, we got the club room for the same price as a standard room, definitely good value.
6	we stayed at this hotel 7 years ago and, apart from the lobby, the rooms have got very tired looking.[SEP]we, like others on here asked for a room away from the construction but with a view of the strip.[SEP]well, the first room was on the 9th floor (?) and had a view over the roof of the multi - story car park and about an inch view of the mgm opposite![SEP]the next day we were moved to the 21st floor and although a better view it was still a very tired looking room and very dark.[SEP]do not order food in sbarros on the casino floor as it was stone cold, over cooked and rubbery.[SEP]nothing good or spectacular stood out for us in this hotel and woud therefore never go back there.[SEP]the next time we go we will stay at ceasars palace for its location, shopping and friendlier atmosphere.
1 2 11 12	like a previous reviewer, my family came for a short visit to san francisco while spending the majority of our vacation time in beautiful lake tahoe.[SEP]having not visited the fisherman's wharf area for many years, the primary shock was finding the dirty, cheesy state of the wharf.[SEP]homeless folks and other unique characters along the streets caused us, my young daughter in particular, to be uncomfortable.[SEP]but within that disappointing aspect of the neighborhood, we found the holiday inn express a wonderful place to come home to.[SEP]the hotel seemed quite new and sort of boutique - like in its decor.[SEP]rooms and public areas were quite clean and the complimentary continental breakfast was much above average for " budget - style " accomodations.[SEP]staff was friendly and always helpful.[SEP]the rooms were smallish, and probably not large enough for 4 people, and our room was probably one of many without any view whatsoever.[SEP]thankfully we chose this hotel for easy access to the cable cars and other things on our " to do " list.[SEP]valet parking was $32.00 per day (before taxes).[SEP]i felt our car was fairly secure in that lot, however the hotel elevator takes anyone down to the parking area unsupervised.[SEP]for our personal tastes, we will likely try a downtown hotel next time we come to san francisco, not because of the hotel but because of our personal discomfort in the wharf atmosphere.[SEP]finding a good rate may be difficult, but location is important to us.
5	arrived very apprehensively to the hotel after reading the negative remarks.[SEP]we were happily suprised.[SEP]staff very pleasant, rooms and bathrooms spotlessly clean, although on the small side.[SEP]our rooms had no natural light, but with the lights on were ok.[SEP]air conditioning worked (was necessary in november!), although noisy from the inside and outside where the vents are.[SEP]however, the hotel is in the middle of nyc and the noise didn't bother us overmuch - the situation is much more important, and the jolly was in a perfect location for shopping and tourism.[SEP]breakfasted across the road in the moonstruck deli (opens at 7 am for the jet lagged).[SEP]i would certainly go back there again!
0	we found the location of this hotel was not ideal due to the fact it so far away from the centre of sydney you either have to get an expensive taxi or cross over two main highways to get to the bus stop the hotel has a basic lobby and the corridors are dark and depressing it is the only hotel we have stayed where you have to swipe your room key in the lift to reach your floor.[SEP]there is something about the feel of this hotel that lacks the personal touch even though the staff were friendly enough even though we had a confirmed booking the reception had no knowledge of it the room we were given was on the side of the building and over looked the railway.[SEP]after talking with the manager we were moved to a room facing the park.[SEP]outside the hotel is a bit rundown with just a few shops
