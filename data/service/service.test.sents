1	i traveled with a large group and everyone had the same complaints.[SEP]seems like staff love to give you a hard time.[SEP]i requested a low floor and got the 17th floor.[SEP]another person in our group asked for 2 beds and was told none of the units in her room type has 2 beds although 3 others, who also had the same room type reservation, checked in around the same time got 2 and even 3 beds in their unit.[SEP]another person asked to be put close to another family and they booked them in 2 different wings.[SEP]no matter what time you went to the front desk they made you wait.[SEP]i have pictures of lines and several staff members talking in a group.[SEP]i can see it happening once in a while but everyday and at different time??!![SEP]the hotel is beautiful and the location is great, for what they charge you would thing the front desk staff would be more helpful.[SEP]bell staff was awesome![SEP]we all made reservations 7 to 8 months ago to try and avoid these problems.
1 1	okay, if you arrive in london sans hotel and this is the only place with rooms available then it's not the end of the world.[SEP]assets are the friendly staff, location, hot water, clean bedding and breakfast room / food.[SEP]liabilities are noisy street, smoke smelling, tiny rooms, no air conditioning, dirty, thread bare carpet, lumpy mattresses and moldy showers.[SEP]my room was large enough for one twin bed and not even another twin bed could have been placed in the room for additional sleeping.[SEP]there is barely enough room to walk between the bed and the wall, so if you're overweight, forget it.[SEP]it's not a three star hotel, but it's probably a high two star.[SEP]for 2 extra euros, you can upgrade from the continental breakfast to a full blown cooked meal with sausage and eggs.[SEP]really, if someone were to re - carpet, paint, add a / c and new mattresses, this place would be the cats meow.[SEP]the location is terrific, only about 1/2 mile from the bayswater metro station and very convenient to banks, restaurants and terrific shopping.
2	my wife and i stayed at the hotel suisse for 4 nights in may.[SEP]this is not your typical hotel but more like a b&b.[SEP]our room was a great size, super clean and the staff were very friendly.[SEP]the location was amazing near the top of the spanish steps.[SEP]it was about a 2 minute walk to the subway for a 5 min train ride to the coloseum or the vatican.[SEP]we walked to the coloseum one day and it took about 20 min.[SEP]if you are looking for a nice little hotel at a great price compared to others in rome this is the place.[SEP]for the room price per night i give this nice little hotel 5 / 5.
2 4 6	this was our third time to vegas, the first time we stayed in the tropicana, the 2nd paris and for new years eve we thought we were upgrading to the bellagio.[SEP]boy, we couldn't have been more wrong.[SEP]the rooms are tired with stained carpets, the casino in need of new slot machines and the service was just plain terrible.[SEP]tried call room service for an excess of 15 minutes one afternoon and decided to give up.[SEP]if they couldn't answer their phone, i didn't want to wait all day for the service.[SEP]i also tried to get coffee one morning in one of that bars, even though they said it was no problem and they would send a waitress to the table, one never came.[SEP]again, after waiting in excess of 15 minutes we did get a waitresses attention and she told us to be patient she had many people to wait on (even though we were there first) and a fresh pot was brewing.[SEP]we have stayed at hotels as low rated as four point sheratons and as high as the four seasons and i would rate the bellagio with the four point sheraton.[SEP]not a bad place if that was what you were expecting.[SEP]on the plus side dinner at prime and olives was wonderful and the service was great, we also enjoyed " o ".[SEP]so go to bellagio for the greats resteraunts and theatre, but stay away for anything else.[SEP]we preferred the paris, it was a much better bang for the buck.
0 1	the location is good but the service was really awful.[SEP]we waited 1h the car from the parking where the average pick up time is 20min, we should stay out of the room for an entire morning due to the cabling of the wifi ; after the work they left the room dirty ; the worst thing was that when we complained about these problems the reception guy was totally unconcerned and served us very bad totally unacceptable
12 13 14	i stayed here on a business trip in late january 2012.[SEP]the hotel is really a good value at around $110/night and the location is perfect if you're doing business near wall street.[SEP]the bed was very comfortable with nice linens.[SEP]the shower was excellent with a waterfall shower head and lots of hot water.[SEP]internet worked great and is included with the room.[SEP]the downside: the rooms are extremely small.[SEP]i didn't eat at the restaurant, but bought a glass of wine at the bar.[SEP]it is very small and certainly nothing fancy.[SEP]$8 for a glass of cheap wine.[SEP]all, in all, i would recommend this place for the value.[SEP]it was clean, had a very comfortable bed and i felt safe.[SEP]one night, there were some very loud people talking in the hallway after midnight.[SEP]i called the front desk and the staff took care of it right away.[SEP]i needed to print a document and they gave me an email address.[SEP]the front desk printed my document, had it waiting for me with no charge![SEP]who does that?
4	can not fault the swissotel.[SEP]great location.[SEP]very central.[SEP]modern in design.[SEP]very courteous staff.[SEP]room was large.[SEP]bathroom was immaculate.[SEP]i was there on business.[SEP]had everything i needed, including access to the internet.[SEP]no trouser press, but they did have iron and ironing board.[SEP]free shoe cleaning service.[SEP]breakfasts were fine.[SEP]i can not comment on price of food / drink as we did not have to pay for either.[SEP]overall, i was very impressed.
1 3	the room was modern and clean, but i literally have a closet in my home larger than this room.[SEP]my reservation was not correct (i'm a gold vip and requested a non - smoking room, they had me in a smoking room).[SEP]i called room service for dinner at 10:45 (room services " closes " at 11 pm).[SEP]they told me - in a demeaning tone - that the kitchen was already closed and then put me on perma - hold.[SEP]i would not stay here again at any price.
1	we (golf foursome) had a pleasure of staying in floridays resort for five days.[SEP]the staff is courteous, friendly and knowledgeable.[SEP]the units are clean and nicely decorated with comfortable beds.[SEP]i would not hesitate to recommend this place to anyone visiting the orlando area.
0 2 3	i stayed here on business and i can honestly say it is the worst hotel that i have ever stayed in.[SEP]if you like dirty rooms, net curtains that are older than the combined age of your party, net curtains that have cigarette burns in them, rooms that are so small you would think you are stood on a postage stamp, bedrooms that have dirty walls and shower heads that have never been cleaned or like stepping out of the shower onto the toilet quite literally, or eating mouldy bread for breakfast then you will love this hotel.[SEP]however if the answer is no to all of the above then do yourself a favour and avoid, avoid & avoid.... i am sure there used to be some wonderful points to say about this hotel but that was probably when it first opened, this hotel needs a massive refurb and some serious customer service thrown in too.[SEP]the hotel is in a great location and could be a fab hotel with some tender loving care... so do yourself a favour and do not stay here, even if the price is a steel it is not worth it trust me...
4 5	the location was ok with access to the subway.[SEP]however, we could hear the tv's blaring in the other rooms, people playing drinking games, distinct conversations (complete with loud swearing) from other rooms, and when our neighbors took a shower the pipes rattled so loud i thought they would come out of the wall.[SEP]it is dark and smelly.[SEP]we couldn't sleep at all.[SEP]burn marks all over the carpet, the window latch was broken so it wouldn't close and the television was also broken, but the staff didn't care when we called about the problems.[SEP]i would never stay here again.
1	we have stayed at this hotel several times over the last few years and have always enjoyed our stay.[SEP]the staff is very friendly and the hotel is a good value.[SEP]the rooms are very clean with refrigerators and microwaves in most rooms.[SEP]they have done some remodeling over the last couple of years and the furnishings are very nice and comfortable.[SEP]the hotel has a continental breakfast complete with several cereals, yogurt, bread, juices and a belgian waffle maker.[SEP]the breakfast room has several tables.[SEP]you are only about 10 minutes from either the san diego zoo or sea world.[SEP]they do have a shuttle to and from the airport.[SEP]we have recommend this hotel to friends and they have always had nice this to say about it.
1 2	having read the mixed reviews didn't know what to expect but we were pleasantly surprised.[SEP]myself, husband and son went over for my birthday and it was a great hotel with staff being nothing but helpful.[SEP]the waiting on staff were great in both the bar area and at breakfast and nothing was too much trouble.[SEP]our room was quite large (by nyc standards) and very clean.[SEP]the location was perfect - i would say half way between times square and central park![SEP]we have stayed in numerous hotels around the world and although it does cater for business, this was not felt in any public areas.[SEP]i would like to add that during our visit, they experienced one of the worst snow storms in history and think of the new york library in the day after tomorrow and that is the picture that will stay with us forever - the best way round was on skis.
2	we decided to splurge and stay downtown for an evening and we were looking for something special.[SEP]and we found it.[SEP]lovely staff at the front desk made us feel very welcome.[SEP]the room was wonderfully upscale, but funky, in a good way.[SEP]comfortable bed and fantastic shower.[SEP]i love it when there's unexpected turndown service, too.[SEP]no view, but a neat little terrace that looked out on post st.[SEP]windows were triple glazed and kept the street noise to a minimum.[SEP]when we checked out the next morning we were treated as if we were old friends.[SEP]we'll definitely try to go back.
1	luna blue was a fabulous place to stay.[SEP]the rooms were spotless, the staff and service was great.[SEP]the air conditioning was beautiful.[SEP]the garden setting was an oasis of calm within a bustling city.[SEP]this is the only place to stay in playa!
1 2	clean neat.[SEP]here is my problem... not greeted as we got out of taxi.[SEP]nobody greeted us first time there didn't know to take elevator.[SEP]room clean.[SEP]really my problem was for the price i felt like i might as well be a ghost.[SEP]no personal service and expensive
0 2	we spent seven nights at this charming excellently staffed hotel.[SEP]we had two adjoining rooms which were small but comfortable.[SEP]it's five star rating is mostly due to its excellent service.[SEP]as the other reviewers have indicated, no problem is too big for the staff to tackle.[SEP]if you are first time visitors to paris, it is great to have such a welcoming base from which to explore the city.[SEP]the breakfast buffet is fine, free wifi is available (although it works best from the lobby) and any and all questions are patiently answered.[SEP]you do need to be aware of a few things that while not a big deal for us (we would love to be back) might sway your decision to stay here: 1.[SEP]the neighborhood is very upscale and residential so the ambience is not as vibrant as in many other parts of the city.[SEP]2.[SEP]the metro is only about five minutes away but many of the other sites are sufficiently far away that once you leave the hotel for the day, you should really only come back after dinner (this would have been a big deal for us if our children had been younger).[SEP]3.[SEP]it can be be a bit noisy since sound carries into the room, but it never got of hand.[SEP]the cons notwithstanding, this hotel deserves its high tripadvisor rank since it provides a lot of value for the money to travelers who are looking to explore the city, especially for the first time.
1 1 1 6	the hotel is perfectly placed for your stay in paris.[SEP]the staff were amasing!!!![SEP]ca nt say this enough.[SEP]the room was fantastic also.[SEP]we stayed in executive suit and the room was perfect size, no 104 (having read previous reviews about room size) the reason for my trip to paris was the propose.[SEP]i had emailed the staff previous to let them know about this special occasion so they could make the room up to my requirements.[SEP]they got back to me very quick indeed and had the room perfect for my arrival.[SEP]they gave us complementary bottle of champagne upon arrival which was a nice touch.[SEP]i asked for them to recommend a place to eat for the occasion, to which they showed me les ombres.[SEP]fantastic eating!![SEP]the view was amasing.[SEP]they organised it for me at the last minute and managed to get me in to eat that nite at the time we wanted, was very impressed.[SEP]can see exactly why this hotel is in top 100 beautiques in the world!![SEP]and top 10 in paris, fantastic and unique place to stay.[SEP]go there!!
1 5 6	for young couples planning to stay somewhere quiet and away from all the disney excitement and orlando nightlife this is the location.[SEP]my husband and i took a taxi from the airport to the suites $55, after checking in we were told no towels were provided for the pool.[SEP]how silly of us to fly across the country and not pack towels items which hotels frequently supply.[SEP]we were jetlagged, hungry and without a vehicle, our only food options were pizza hut and the irish pub.[SEP]the only good that came from our stay was the free shuttle to disney epcot and the jacuzzi in our room.[SEP]i was unhappy with the lack of close dinning options, no hotel bar or coffee service and the layout of the hotel.[SEP]there was no daily room service, no complimentary breakfast, finally the spa services were overpriced.
7 9	we stayed the weekend for a concert at the magnolia theater and loved it.[SEP]the room was clean and nice.[SEP]it had a small kitchen with micro, full sized fridge, two electric burners and a toaster oven.[SEP]our room did not have a full size oven, but we ate out everyday, so it wasn't a problem.[SEP]free internet access (ethernet, so bring your own connections), free gated parking, quiet hallways.[SEP]we didn't partake of the continental breakfast, so i have no opinion on that.[SEP]also didn't use the pool & hot tub, but it looked clean and well - kept.[SEP]the only negative was that none of the maids on our floor spoke english, so just getting towels & pillows instead of full housekeeping service was a challenge.[SEP]eventually told the maids to not clean the room and went downstairs to the front desk for my towels.[SEP]the front desk was very helpful and apologetic.
5	we stayed here for four nights in may and i was a bit nervous about the location after hearing the reviews however i am so glad this didn't put me off.[SEP]there is a bus stop 2 minutes from the hotel and this bus goes past about every 10 minutes and it takes you to the termini (main metro / train station) in rome, this trip took 15minutes at the most.[SEP]yes some of the buses are very full but if that s the case wait for the next one![SEP]from the termini you can get to most of the sites and if you are mobile you can walk between them.[SEP]i was glad to use the public transport because it made me feel less of a tourist![SEP]the hotel itself is beautifully decorated, the staff are friendly and helpful - they gave us a map when we first arrived and explained where everything was.[SEP]i definately recommend having a nice strong coffee with breakfast, it really sets you up for the day![SEP]if i was to return to rome (and i hope i do - i loved it!) i would stay at this hotel.[SEP]one more tip book your tickets for the vatican online - the queue if you turn up on the day is about 3hrs long!!!
1 1 4 6	checked in for four nights just before christmas.[SEP]great location however the male receptionist who usually works the evenings (the guy with the parting hair) is rude and just not interested to assist anyone.[SEP]our room (1721) was a good size however beware, as this has 2 interconnecting doors and you could literally hear everything that's going on.[SEP]the beds are tiny - both me and my wife are slim but could not fit on the bed.[SEP]when i asked' parting hair' to have en extra bed, he quickly brushed me off and said that if i wanted an extra bed we had to pay extra.[SEP]i politely informed him that i was complaining about the bed and the only solution was to put money towards our problem.[SEP]some service eh?[SEP]eventually we had no choice but to pay for the extra bed.[SEP]the hotel has some plus points, clean, great breakfast and friendly staff in the restaurant.
9 10	i have been thinking since we left paris yesterday about this review, since there have been so many raves about this hotel.[SEP]in part, i agree.[SEP]the k&k cayre is in the best possible location -- bridging the 6th and 7th arrondissements.[SEP]everything is accessible, and the neighborhood is a treasure trove of wonderful shops, restaurants, museums, etc.[SEP]i am not sure about the " value " of this hotel, since we had a triple rather than a double.[SEP]for a triple, it was very reasonably priced.[SEP]one thing that does not come through in most of the other reviews, is that this hotel is not a top tier hotel -- not by any stretch a luxury hotel nor a charming left bank retreat.[SEP]it is immaculately clean, with serviceable modern bathrooms (but no bathroom fan), but the interior looks more like a comfort inn than a parisian hotel.[SEP]i don't mean to suggest that it is comparable to a comfort inn -- it clearly has a few more amenities, including wonderful bed linens -- but no one should go here expecting the montalembert.[SEP]the staff at the desk was very helpful and accommodating, particularly cedric, who made all our dinner reservations for us.[SEP]all in all, a very good hotel experience.[SEP]we would definitely stay at the cayre again if the price is right.
0	the food was fantastic, the staff very helpful only complaint i asqued for two beds and got one and my view was the wall to the parking lot.[SEP]p.s. this complaint has nothing to do with the hotel only the neighborhood, i'm from new york and i'm used to deal with every nationality but i had the desplausure of meating(not all)but the most recist people in my life
8 8 10 11	i recently enjoyed a great one - night stay here.[SEP]this hotel has the best price - to - value ratio in downtown seattle.[SEP]the room rate includes a lot of extras, e.g. the shuttle that takes you to all the tourist spots, wi - fi, hot breakfast & happy hour.[SEP]did i forget anything?[SEP]oh, use of the billards room is included as well.[SEP]the location looks a bit far away from pike place market on a map but it's an easy 10 - 15 minute walk from the hotel.[SEP]less than 5 minutes in, this walk will take you thru the most vibrant part of the downtown core on pike street.[SEP]my suite was comfortable, well - appointed, and most importantly clean as a whistle -- particularly the bathroom![SEP]another big plus is the super - friendly and efficient staff: check - in was smooth and gracious, and the staff who maintained the breakfast area seemed genuinely happy to be of service.[SEP]breakfast was substantial and hearty, although the hot foods could have been a little hotter.[SEP]all in all, a terrific stay.[SEP]highly recommended!
2 4 11	you'd be hard pressed to get a better location (2 blocks to columbus circle subway) and a quieter stay on this residential street near the action, restaurants and bars.[SEP]priceline considers this 3 stars and i'd agree.[SEP]however, when attempting to reserve 2 doubles (vs 1 king) non smoking i had to laugh when they offered me a smoking king room at check in.[SEP]that's what i'll now call the priceline screw, reinforced by holiday inn booking staff.[SEP]for a $155 bid per nite i can't complain, but what the heck.[SEP]after repeated complaints i was given a non smoking, but no double beds surfaced and i declined their suggestion of paying an add'l $25 per nite for a rollaway.[SEP]free wifi too weak except in lobbby.[SEP]free bag storage on check out day is a bonus.[SEP]clean room, but worn and dated and a bit musty.[SEP]the windows could be cracked open for some fresh air, which was nice and did help.[SEP]permanent sign in hallway asking for patience while they upgrade, probably been posted for months.[SEP]overall, this place will not disappoint, just keep your expectations " average.[SEP]" p.s. in the morning, go push the elevator button before you brush your teeth and dress, maybe it will arrive by the time you come back.
0 3	i stayed in this hotel for business with coworker and one of the reasons we chose the hotel was because they would allow us to split the bill on two credit ; however upon arrival we learned they had charged one for everything in advance and would not fix their error.[SEP]the very long trek to our room was filled with a stale smell and horrible decor.[SEP]the room itself seemed to be partially updated, but the shower curtain an carpet fit in with the seventies design in the hallway.[SEP]the beds were tiny and horribly uncomfortable, and we had to call to ask for a maid to clean the room.[SEP]next time i'll save myself the money and stay at a motel 6... a much better choice than this hotel.
0 2 3 7 8	the room was okay, but the service is what killed this hotel.[SEP]i had a shopping bag with a new purchase taken from my room.[SEP]when i reported the incident to security, very few people actually cared.[SEP]the housekeeper that actually cleaned my room on the day when my bag went missing showed up in my room while i was in there (alone) and confronted me and made me feel unsafe.[SEP]i reported the second incident to the staff and all i got was a " we'll talk to her.[SEP]" seriously?[SEP]a guest feels unsafe and that's all you are willing to do?[SEP]i will never stay in this hotel again.[SEP]i do not recommend it.
1	what a deal![SEP]friendly, helpful staff ; large (for europe) bedroom and excellent bathroom ; and the price was right![SEP]close to everything -- we walked to all the museums and sights every day.[SEP]numerous excellent restaurants located nearby.[SEP]perfect location for our needs.
0	this is a very nice hotel with top - notch service and staff.[SEP]you will pay for it, but if you want to avoid the touristy hotels of branson, this is a beautiful place to stay and eat.
0	i was so angry with the way i was treated by the manager on duty upon my arrival that i decided to check out the next morning and stay at alternative accomodation.[SEP]i was initially denied a room after a long plane trip.[SEP]then i was humiliated, because i was rightfully angry, and fored to sit down for ten minutes before this man would serve me again.[SEP]the concierge and other staff were helpful, in organising another room, when the tv wasn't working in the room i was finally allocated.[SEP]also there was no yellow pages in room, and the shower was awkward to use, and the half flush on the toilet wouldn't work.
0 2 3	a total disaster of a hotel experience if you are looking for a skimpy breakfast, 20 square tub - less micro shower in a windowless bath, mini towels that remove layers of skin, unusually low and frail bedframes with concave mattresses, flat unyielding pillows, and cheerless room decor along with a disorganized and creepy staff, this is the place for you.[SEP]after our bed collapsed three times and being accused of juming up and down on it- absurd for a 61 year old- tossing the broken and unrepaired bedframe in the hall and sleeping on the floor the last night, we fled to the nearest 4 star for relief.[SEP]even with our complaints and 48 hour cancellation notice the hotel refused to return the 500.00 euro they owed us![SEP]they were snotty and rude.[SEP]we are well traveled, seen it all, and this was an unmitigated nightmare.
5	booked 3 rooms at hotel on recent visit for 8 people.[SEP]all of us were very pleased number one with the size of the rooms, the great staff, and cleanliness.[SEP]i travel a lot and its very hard to please everybody but the avalon did.[SEP]the amount we paid for a jr suite compares to most ny small rooms plus u get pass to a real gym.[SEP]the free breakfast is just cereal and few pasteries.[SEP]good safe location as well and the entire staff is friendly from door man to front desk to housekeeping.[SEP]another plus is rooms are almost sound proof could nt hear anything in hallways or next door.
5	the roosevelt's lobby is it's best asset.[SEP]beyond this it is a very dated hotel.[SEP]we booked a double double, thankfully, as the rooms are small.[SEP]the bathroom was basic, but did have a good supply of towels and the beds are comfortable.[SEP]everything could do with a make - over.[SEP]some of the staff were quite rude and left a lot to be desired.[SEP]on the positive side it is in a fantastic location for everthing and eamonn's pub, just two minutes away, is well worth a visit for great bar food.
2	i stayed at the hotel for 2 nights from feb 18 to feb 20.[SEP]a very small property in the old montreal area but very well appointed and absolutely charming.[SEP]the staff was attentive and friendly and provided excellent service.[SEP]i would definitely stay here again!
2 11	my first trip to las vegas and i stayed in las vegas.[SEP]i had the best time i thought i would never have.[SEP]the hotel and was really cheap but excellent service and cleaniness in each room.[SEP]hey, the rooms were nt the best as other 5 star hotels but for what you pay to stay there they are great![SEP]i loved being able to walk to the other great hotels right from excalibur.[SEP]they were so close.[SEP]i had a great view of both the pools.[SEP]i went in the pool and waterslide and they were great.[SEP]i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone espically family types.[SEP]the theme was awesome and the arcade was really fun.[SEP]the buffets and resturants had the greatest food and prices out of the other hotels i went to.[SEP]i loved staying in excailbur i had no problems with the staff and not alot with the rooms.[SEP]anyone traveling to las vegas should stay in excalibur.[SEP]i will never forget how wonderful it was.
1 2	found hotel room to be slightly grimey ; mini bar fridge looked like it hadn't been cleaned in months.[SEP]also maid came in and made beds but, failed to empty bins despite them overflowing.[SEP]tv wasn't working in our room and when we asked at reception was told that in some rooms they didn't and there was nothing he could do about it (or, in other words he couldn't care less) carpets also dirty and furniture looked about 40 years old ; bed also horrible.
1 5 6 10 13 14	i stayed at the windsor court for a girls weekend trip to new orleans, and this hotel was the best part of our stay.[SEP]every employee we came in contact with was so warm and welcoming.[SEP]they knew our names and treated us like royalty.[SEP]the hotel itself is amazing.[SEP]so old world charming and beautiful with wonderful artwork everywhere you look.[SEP]the tea service in the lobby is so lovely and the lounge is relaxed with great service.[SEP]the concierge service, adam and travis were amazing![SEP]they were able to help us with suggestions for places to go and directions.[SEP]they took such good care of us, we didn't want to leave.[SEP]the room was spacious and very well appointed.[SEP]the housekeeping and turn down service was perfect.[SEP]we had a great view from our room.[SEP]we met sarah the sommelier, and her knowledge and enthusiasm for all things wine was absolutely infectious.[SEP]it is a fantastic hotel with a staff that really knows how to take care of people and make everyone feel welcomed.[SEP]they really understand the word hospitality.[SEP]if you ever get the chance, you want to stay here in new orleans!!!!
0 2 8 10	my stay at the wneworleans was horrible.[SEP]my wife and i were staying in the city for a wedding.[SEP]i don't know which was worst ; the dirty room, front desk staff, or the housekeeping mod.[SEP]i checked into a dirty room on the 14th floor (i forget exact room number).[SEP]i asked to switch rooms and was told that there were none available.[SEP]i asked for a manager and a very nice (so i thought) lady showed and introduced herself to me as kenya housekeeping supervisor.[SEP]she reassured me that she would take care of all my concerns.[SEP]when she left my room: i overheard her speaking with a male employee in the halls about her aggravation with my wife and i.[SEP]i was distraught![SEP]i will be reporting this to corporate headquarters.[SEP]wno should hire staff members that enjoy their job.
2 4 5	stayed here last fall after seeing reviews online.[SEP]we were very excited to give it a try after emails with the owners.[SEP]it was the worst hotel we have stayed at in amsterdam![SEP]the room was shabby and not well - tended.[SEP]one day, we left early for a day trip and returned home to find the room not made up and the towels were not changed.[SEP]the surly evening desk clerk initially refused to give us fresh towels and said it was our fault as we obviously did not let the room cleaners in the room.[SEP]from that point on, it was very uncomfortable with one of the owners.[SEP]for the money they charge, one would think that one would receive better value / service for the money.
0	the most rude croupiers i ve ever come across do nt argue with them they will not let you play on tables.[SEP]i know this from experience, they need to review their staff their to old and look like they have had enough og workinh there try another hotel a bit more money but worth it
2	what can i say about a large, spotless, modern room with an amazing view?[SEP]everything about our stay here over memorial day was spectacular.[SEP]the staff was friendly and helpful (including doormen, concierge, desk staff, even bartenders!) even the elevators were fast.[SEP]our room with a king bed was spotless and very comfortable.[SEP]we will definitely be back, great location too.
1 6	anyone who has left negative feedback for this hotel must be thinking of somewhere else.[SEP]sure it's not the flashiest and yes the pool is not large but it was comfortable, clean, rooms are large and the service is better than we have ever received anywhere.[SEP]even before we went the staff (thank you marcus) booked activites for us and helped us with advice.[SEP]the free " minibar ", dvd library, popsicles at the pool are all really lovely touches that help make the stay great.[SEP]location is brilliant just one block from hollywood boulevard.[SEP]if you have kids we'd recommend the brunch at the magic castle magic club on saturday / sunday - great fun and one of the things the hotel organised for us beforehand.[SEP]if we ever go back to hollywood we will definitely be staying here again.
3	the location of the hotel is excellent.[SEP]it's right in the centre and in a pleasant area.[SEP]it is close to all public transport: buses, trains, metros, tourist buses, and airport bus.[SEP]the reception staff were extremely helpful and friendly and answered any questions we had.[SEP]they also spoke excellent english.[SEP]we had a double room with a sofa bed.[SEP]a cot with proper baby bed linen was provided for our baby, who was free.[SEP]the room was a comfortable size and had a good sized balcony / terrace which was a godsend with the baby.[SEP]at least 4of the 6 rooms on the first floor (floor p) had access to a similar terrace.[SEP]breakfast was included and had a vast choice: yoghurts, pastires, cakes, cereals, cold meats, salads, savoury baguettes, fruit, cooked meats and scrambled eggs.[SEP]the lounge on floor p had internet access and refreshments avaialable for guests all day long ; bottled water, tea, coffee sandwiches, pastries and some cava in the evening.[SEP]i thought it was excellent value for the location and facilities
2 5	my wife and i had a five days stay at the hotel sapphire (hotel safir in turkish) in june.[SEP]for me it was my first time in istanbul, whereas my wife had lived for a few years in the city, though that was over 20 years ago.[SEP]we chose hotel sapphire because of the excellence of its reviews in trip adviser and our expectations were fully fulfilled.[SEP]if you are looking for a hotel that has character, is located conveniently for all of the usual tourist sites (it's roughly halfway between the blue mosque and the galata bridge) and does everything within its power to look after and assist its guests then this is the hotel for you.[SEP]we can not fault its cleanliness and the quality and variety of the food that it offered.[SEP]but best of all were the ever friendly, helpful and courteous staff.[SEP]all of our requests for assistance regarding the booking of a restaurant (we went to rami whose rooftop restaurant overlooks the blue mosque), a performance by the " whirling dervishes " and a bosphorous boat tour were met with infectious enthusiasm.[SEP]istanbul doesn't need our praises to persuade you to go there.[SEP]would we go again - yes.[SEP]would we return to the hotel sapphire - yes.[SEP]would i recommend the hotel to friends and family and to the wider public - yes without any hesitation.
6 7 9	i was a part of a group that stayed at this hotel for a weekend getaway.[SEP]when we arrived in the lobby it was absolutely beautiful.[SEP]the elevators were equipped with televisions so that you could watch cnn on the way to our floor.[SEP]when you stepped off of the elevator, that's when you entered the twilight zone![SEP]we went to our rooms... it smelled, was dirty and just old.[SEP]and we were in the newly renovated wing.[SEP]there were no towels and it took us hours to receive them.[SEP]i had a bed that looked like it had been slept in, so i called maid service to have it changed, and was reprimanded by the maid on duty.[SEP]my friends and i couldn't even get a good night sleep because we were so uncomfortable.[SEP]we then had native new yorkers visit us at the hotel, they were so excited because they heard so many wonderful things about this hotel, until they too entered the twilight zone!!![SEP]my only advice after this experience is to enter at your own risk!!!
2	4th time staying at jw orlando- lobby bar down for 3 weeks with no notice prior to checkin..[SEP]roaches galore if you sit outside lobby bar... chair cushions around pool / lazy river have holes coming through and should have been replaced 2 yrs ago..[SEP]room service expect 90 minutes + and substandard quality... won't come back and we loved the place on our first visit
4 6	we first got room 401 which is located on the main street but the noise was so much we could not sleep all night![SEP]it's like the windows were still open.[SEP]we requested another room (807) which was a little better but still quite noisy.[SEP]all rooms are small to very small and their king bed seemed to be just a queen.[SEP]the staff is very unfriendly and even rude, don't expect to get much more than a grunt as a response.[SEP]the location is ok, a few blocks from union square where some public transport is located.[SEP]on our trip we stayed in 14 other (lower - priced) hotels (including new york city, washington dc) and every single one of them was a lot better... i would certainly not recommend this hotel to anyone.[SEP]tip: avoid their 14$/day charge for internet and go to the starbucks close by at the chinatown gate for your internet needs.
0 3 4 6	this hotel was perfect form beginning to end.[SEP]the room itself is great with a very nice bathroom and cable tv.[SEP]the room is clean and smells pretty good![SEP]the hotel staff were very nice.[SEP]they tried there best to meet our demands.[SEP]they helped us also with info on how to get around the city.[SEP]great staff.[SEP]plus it is located right next to a subway!!![SEP]i recommend this hotel to everyone!!![SEP]have fun in new york!!!
1 2 8	well what can i say that other reviewers have not already said, yes this is only a travelodge but for the price we paid (55.65 for one night) we thought this was well over the top.[SEP]ok bed was clean enough but 1 towell between 2 people is not good!![SEP]why should guest have to asked for another towell they must have known there was 2 people staying when we booked.[SEP]the bath needed needed something doing to it as it was not dirty but black in the bottom!![SEP]if it was enamal then it needs re enamalling.[SEP]this place needs a real good makeover, it might then be passable.[SEP]very drab room not helped by poor lighting.[SEP]also as with another review batterys run out in tv remote.[SEP]was not to pleased at returning at 12.20am to find main door wide open and no sign of any reception staff, any old tom, dick or harry could have walked in, so security did not get 10/10 from us.[SEP]if we had to stay here again would only do so if they paid us!!!![SEP]surprise, surprise we will not be returning!
0 2 6 6	got confirmation even though hotel has no room left.[SEP]so unethical![SEP]they sent us over across street for mgm which i did not even like in the first place (overrated hotel for the look but no quality of service).[SEP]our original reservation was for 3 nights and excalibur's manager promised to take care of it at mgm, but only to find out we got kicked out after second night (again unethical).[SEP]i'd made it very clear that i do not want to move back and forth with luggage and check - in / out hassle.[SEP]i called up excalibur and being transfer from place to places, put on hold for a long time.[SEP]management were so rude, at one point a manager intentionally put me on hold and hung up (ways unethical).[SEP]we come here every new year and major holidays for past 20 yrs and things'd gotten worse every year.
8 9	we had booked a standard room, but on arrival we upgraded to the business floor and it was an excellent decision.[SEP]we had a beautiful room on the 10th floor, bright and spacious with a full sized tub and a luxurious shower.[SEP]the bed was huge and very comfortable.[SEP]the room also has a nespresso coffee machine for coffee lovers.[SEP]we also had fluffy robes and slippers, daily fresh fruit and newspaper delivery.[SEP]we had access to the club lounge and had breakfast there every morning.[SEP]there was an excellent selection and eggs were cooked to order.[SEP]lovely coffee, tea and soft drinks available all day and in the evening, cocktails, wine and hot canapes are served.[SEP]the lounge staff were extremely friendly and helpful.[SEP]this was our first visit to sydney and they had lots of helpful advice and suggestions to make the most of our time.[SEP]the hotel is in a fantastic location for everything, we were able to walk everywhere.[SEP]we hope to come back to sydney and will stay here again.
6	don't be put off by the not - so - welcoming entrance to this hotel.[SEP]once you've gone up a flight, you are in a lovely spot.[SEP]the public " living room " is large and comfortable, with a long table that's beautifully set every morning for the sumptuous continental breakfast.[SEP]the rooms are good sized and charming, very comfortable.[SEP]throughout the hotel is a display of artwork that ranges from etchings to oil paintings to exhibit posters to funky sculptures.[SEP]it's fantastic![SEP]the staff and manager were delightful and helpful.
1 2	my sister, father, and i stayed here from march 14 2011 - march 18 2011 because we found a " good deal " on priceline and we had to go pick up her wedding dress in hollywood.[SEP]the price for parking at this hotel is $35.00 a day and it is not convenient at all, the valet service was never on time and the cost of parking cost more than breakfast everyday.[SEP]the only other option was to spend $25.00 and choose not to do the valet and park in a different lot, extremely inconvenient.[SEP]we were also in the hotel during the playboy golf experience, other than lots of skanky girls in the lobby, they were nt harming anyone other than making way too much noise.[SEP]the fridge in the rooms is nt even a fridge its just a ploy to get you to drink their microsized $5.00 bottles of water, you are designated one tiny spot in the fridge for something of your own but the only thing you can fit in it is a can of pop.[SEP]i would not stay at this hotel again if the parking was free.[SEP]p.s. internet is like $12/day stick with the hampton inn = free high speed internet
1 5	we got our laptops and a digital camera stolen the 2nd night we stayed there.....[SEP]the general manager never contacted us we never got any reports from them concerning the issue.[SEP]all they offer was a free breakfast which is a joke since a night in this hotel is close to $200 a night!![SEP]i can buy my own breakfast any day!!!!![SEP]ps.[SEP]the staff and even the hotel president were indifferent and unprofessional regarding this issue!!![SEP]worse experience ever!!!!
6	its good but not as good as people make out i have read the reviews on here and they all seem to love this hotel.[SEP]it is a good hotel but once you look past the few nice touches it is no better than most other hotels in london that charge 拢115 a night.[SEP]the bottles of water and milk in the fridge are very welcome and so is the decent quality coffee.[SEP]the bathrooms are pretty impressive a spotless clean.[SEP]the local area hox guide is very useful and the funky art on the walls in the room is cool too.[SEP]but once you have taken that all in it just becomes another hotel.[SEP]room service is terrible.[SEP]the menu is tiny and the quality is dreadful.[SEP]i didn鈥檛 like the yogurt in the breakfast bag but was told i could not change it for anything else so would have to pay extra fro breakfast in the restaurant 鈥?when you are paying more than 拢115 a night you would expect a choice of breakfast to be included.[SEP]the lobby area has a bar and restaurant which are always packed with locals and guests.[SEP]i couldn鈥檛 get a table so had to eat out as i couldn鈥檛 book a table when i didn鈥檛 know what time i would be eating.[SEP]the hotel does some offers from time to time where rooms start from 拢1 but when paying full price the hotel is on a par with many others 鈥?don鈥檛 get sucked in by a few nice touches here and there and see it for what it is, a hotel
3 11 11	just returned from a week stay at floridays over christmas visiting disney and universal.[SEP]our 2-bedroom suite was very nice, clean and i had absolutely no complaints.[SEP]i have two teenage kids, 15 and 16, and they both had a great time in the hot tub and game room.[SEP]customer service was outstanding and the staff very accomodating.[SEP]there is a publix supermarket only a block away and very convienient for shopping for food / supplies.[SEP]there is also a very nice shopping center down the street from publix (prime outlets).[SEP]universal and disney are a short drive away-- we rented a vehicle, so we had no problems driving the 10 - 15 minutes to the parks.[SEP]during prime time, get to the parks early![SEP]we were at universal and disney parking lots early (one hour before the parks actually open) and on christmas eve and christmas day, we had a wonderful time before noon.[SEP]after that, the park gets a little crowded and wait time for rides is longer.[SEP]we're all early birds, so we had a great time before the parks got too crowded.[SEP]housekeeping was great and by the time we returned from the parks, our rooms had fresh towels / washcloths, beds were made and trash was removed.[SEP]not sure about a recent post where they had no washcloths-- we had fresh towels and washcloths every day.[SEP]we had a wonderful time and i would recommend this resort to others.
0 6	the check in lines were terrible long, even with the massive lobby.[SEP]the odor of cigarette smoke was simply everywhere, even in our room!!![SEP]even in the grand buffet!!!!!![SEP]ugh![SEP]we did enjoy the lion habitat: but one month later we watched tv at home with horror as that trainer was attacked.[SEP]we did not visit the casino because of the smoke.[SEP]all night long we had a person banging on our door to get in ; the fellow was lost or drunk ; we finally had to call security to remove him from our floor.[SEP]a room service breakfast was the only nice highlight of our one night stay.
3	in the 21st century, it seems inconceivable that a modern hotel in a major chain would have a problem with hot water but the manchester grand hyatt does.[SEP]my room, 601, would have scalding hot water followed by ice cold and would mostly stay cold.[SEP]this happened over several days at various times of the day.[SEP]when i complained, front desk staff said there was nothing they could do.[SEP]when you add that to the dirty carpet, peeling wallpaper and cracked bathroom counters, this place is a dump.[SEP]never again.
6 9	i donâ€ ™ t know where to start.[SEP]this was my second trip to montrã © al and a friend of mine booked the hotel online with 2 queenâ€ ™ s size bed.[SEP]we arrived at our hotel and the next thing we find out is that what we reserved was not what we got.[SEP]we got a room with one dirty bed.[SEP]the place smelled like smoke and dirt.[SEP]there was only one staff working in the entire hotel.[SEP]the receptionist could not even communicate with us properly.[SEP]omg i been to so many hotel, but this place was worse then a motel.[SEP]i would not never ever stay there again nor would i recommend this place to anyone.[SEP]overall the hotel ws not clean ; we did not get what we booked, the staff was very rude and overall customer service was lacking.[SEP]please refrain from staying at this hotel.
3	the palace really is a class act - but then it should be for the price![SEP]it's perfectly located close to the prado and the stunning parque del retiro, while all other sights are easily walkable.[SEP]the shopping and nightlife of malasana and chueca are nearby too.[SEP]reception staff were friendly and professional - as indeed were all staff in the hotel.[SEP]the bedroom and bathroom were spacious, spotless and comfortable with all the normal facilities.[SEP]the only niggle was that the mattress felt as if it had seen better days - i kept rolling into the middle![SEP]the focal point of the hotel is the stunning rotunda, its glass dome as impressive in the daylight as it is at night.[SEP]a great place to have a drink, have breakfast or a meal.[SEP]we only dined in the hotel once but the food was exceptional - and 150 euros for three courses.[SEP]breakfast was excellent too but 35 euros if you haven't booked in advance.[SEP]so this hotel isn't cheap but we did resent having to pay for wireless in our room.[SEP]not everyone wants to go to a business centre to check emails and more and more hotels these days offer it free.[SEP]overall this is a fine hotel that deserves its reputation and i would definitely return.
6 7 8	we booked 3 rooms for 5 days in may.[SEP]when we arrived, i was very disappointed in the hotel lobby.[SEP]the leather sofas were cracked and worn and the whole room looked disshelved.[SEP]all 3 bedrooms were extremely small, which we expected, but my husband and i could not even pass each other in the room.[SEP]the furniture was very worn, the beds were practically on the floor, and overall, no ambiance.[SEP]however, the bathrooms were modern and very nice.[SEP]the only reason to stay at this hotel is the service and location.[SEP]all the staff was very helpful.[SEP]the front desk was attentive and very nice to help with questions, reservations, calling taxis, etc.[SEP]one day after sight - seeing all day, i came back to my room to find my bottle of white wine on ice by the head housekeeper.[SEP]what a nice surprise![SEP]the neighborhood, rue cler, is absolutely fabulous.[SEP]my husband and i both agreed that when we return to paris, we will definitely stay in the rue cler again but probably choose a different hotel.[SEP]the hotel is in the midst of renovation and they had a photograph of what the renovated rooms will look like and they will be " ultra modern " which is not in keeping with this old hotel.[SEP]so, for that reason, we will look at other hotels in the area next time.
0	i don't have words to say " thank you " to all the staff of del prado hotel, great value for an extraordinary service, huge rooms with a beautiful view.
3	just returned from easter break in venice, the san clemente was not my first choice but booked late and this was best option.[SEP]the hotel and staff are really good, i have stayed in some of the best hotels in the world and would say this would be high on my list of favourites.[SEP]booking late i got an incredible rate of 185 euros a night and expected to be put in a small room with no view, quite the opposite happened we were given a great room with walk in closet and a view over to st marks square.[SEP]the service was impeccable from the concierge to the maids, our room was always made up when we left and we appreciated the note left at turndown giving the weather forecast for following day.[SEP]the restaurants and bar were good and they make some mean cocktails, although as all of venice overpriced.[SEP]the only negative is as some other reviewers have mentioned the place does lack a certain atmosphere, you sometimes feel you are the only people in the hotel.[SEP]this said we were quite happy as did not go to venice to spend it with other people and the plus side is you get to leave the day trippers of st marks behind.
2	the location of this hotel is quite good as right by the tottenham court road station and the shops in oxford street.[SEP]however the hotel is extremely tired and in desperate need of refurbishment.[SEP]the check in staff lack personality and are rude in their approach.[SEP]we were passed from pillar to post with one girl looking at us as if we were aliens![SEP]the girl that finally dealt with us was very nice but one out of four is a poor ratio.[SEP]the first room we were given smelt so we requested a change.[SEP]the next room smelt exactly the same... assuming they would all be the same we accept it.[SEP]the rooms are very small as was the bathroom.[SEP]when the shower was on the rest of the bathroom was soaked.[SEP]if you want a good nights sleep i would not suggest this hotel as extremely noisy.[SEP]if you open the window the traffic noise is unbearable.[SEP]breakfast was very good.[SEP]the concierge was also very helpful.[SEP]considering the price of the hotel compared to a premier lodge i think it is quite good.
4	staying at mostly 4 stars and up hotels, i was really impressed with this one.[SEP]the price of the hotel is great even when i stayed during the weekend.[SEP]the hotel room feels super new and clean, things which i liked compared to the nearby hilton(it feels unkempt i dare not take off my shoes).[SEP]the overall decor of the hotel is very modern as well.[SEP]the customer service i received was excellent and they are very helpful.[SEP]however, the pool and hot tub are pretty small.[SEP]this hotel is not even listed in the local hotel magazines.[SEP]i wonder why?
0 1	just need to advise the bar and waiting staff that the customer needs to be acknowleged and chats between themselves can wait..[SEP]happened too often to be a one off.
6 8	i have just returned from a long weekend, at this hotel a birthday treat for my daughter for her 16th birthday.[SEP]we stayed in a family room with my neice and her daughter also.[SEP]the location was great, i especially liked being able to access the north and south grayline tours just outside the door.[SEP]anthony the conceierge was particularly helpful and informative.[SEP]we had really comfy beds and pillows unfortunately the beds were smaller than had been booked.[SEP]i was stunned by the complete lack of tea making facilities, and over $29 for tea for four was ridiculous.[SEP]the staff at breakfast were inattentive and slow, they only had to sort the tea and coffee orders and for two days out of the four we stayed the drinks order had to be chased, thank god the view was good i had to organise to post a parcel back to uk and asked at reception to borrow a pair of scissors only to be refused!!![SEP]helpful not.....[SEP]rubbish customer service i would think twice before returning
3 5	as a starwood platinum member i normally love w hotels.[SEP]this time was not the case.[SEP]i was not a big fan the first time i stayed here 6 months ago but thought i would give it one more try - a mistake.[SEP]this hotel is a) not central b) extremely small c) has rude and minimal staff.[SEP]valet parking is $32 and we waited 15 mins just to park.[SEP]there is not enough staff (waited 25mins for our bags, waited 15 mins to check in).[SEP]the hotel is also not at all central - i would stay at a lot of other hotels over the w in san diego - the new marriott in gas lamp, the ivy or us grant.[SEP]do nt pay the top dollars w ask - you will get nothing in return.
2 6	my husband and i were gifted an overnight stay at this wonderful pearl of a hotel![SEP]it's a charming blend of modern and traditional, and sits in a terrific location that lets you spill out into the heartbeat of union square.[SEP]staff - everyone from the front desk folks to the housekeeping staff -- actually smiled and made it a point to " connect " with us on a personal level.[SEP]what a nice feeling![SEP]we look forward to a next visit without hesitation![SEP]they live up to their parent company name -- personality hotels![SEP]p.s. loved their fun treatment of the usual written messages one normally finds in a hotel room.[SEP]kudos for the creativity!
6	we arrived during the night only to find that there were no parking facilities.[SEP]we were directed to finsbury ncp by travelodge staff.[SEP]i drove to the bottom of the ramp only to discover that the charges were £ 36 for 24hrs i had difficulty reversing back out as the ramp was steep.[SEP]we drove around for ages trying to find another place to park.[SEP]the next day we found another car park they charged us £ 20 for 24hrs.[SEP]they said that travelodge claim that there are parking facilities and usually direct their customers to them.[SEP]i thought that this was quite deceptive as travelodge hotels usually have parking facilities with reasonable rates.[SEP]i won't be staying there again!!!!!!!!!!
8	overall hotel was ok * room was on 5th floor.[SEP]nice view outside.[SEP]however we were only allowed send our bags up in the lift and we had to walk the stairs for the 3 nights we were there.[SEP]* inside needed upgrading (they were renovating next door and woke us up early 2 mornings).[SEP]there was torn wallpaper and leak marks, a broken bathroom door with no lock.[SEP]hallway had beds, laundry and rubbish.[SEP]looks like re - furb is still very much in progress.[SEP]room was clean just physically poor condition.[SEP]* reception staff never said hello, good evening etc.[SEP]until we did (poor show).[SEP]reception looks lovely.[SEP]* breakfast was decent continental style * wifi was patchy * location was great, same street as sorbonne * * * * go to le petite perigourdine * * * * restaurant a couple of doors down.[SEP]better meal than any of tourist haunts closer to quai st.[SEP]michel or rue severin / huchette
8	in paris we expect small rooms but our room was so tiny that one person needed to lie on the bed while the other moves around.[SEP]we are not big people and we travel light with average sized suitcases (combined weight of 32kg) which we could not fit in tiny wardrobe so they took up a third of the floor space in the room.[SEP]i actually looked at the rooms across the hall which were advertised as being larger but they appeared only marginally bigger and the added space of an impractical use.[SEP]free wifi was so slow it was of limited value.[SEP]each day we were at the hotel, we returned to our room at 5 pm to find it had not been cleaned so we would have to leave the hotel and sit in a bar until room cleaned as impossible for us to be in the room with the cleaner.[SEP]at that time of night we prefer to be resting before going out for dinner.[SEP]we are regular visitors to paris, we always stay in the same hotel but thought we would try something different.[SEP]this hotel is not good value and we are returning in may but will go back to our old hotel as we now appreciate how good it is.[SEP]that aside, the nice things i can say are the staff in the hotel were friendly and helpful, the hotel is clean and cute and in a good location.[SEP]it is just too small for comfort and not worth the room rate.
1 5	it is exactly two years since i stayed here, but a recent discussion with colleagues about lost property in hotels got me back to trip advisor to write this.[SEP]the property and room were very much catering for asian customers, with little english apparently spoken by reception staff.[SEP]it was a fairly low cost hotel for our transit stay.[SEP]however in our haste to leave, we did leave clothing and some other items in the room owing to my girlfriend slipping on the tiled floor and requiring medical treatment.[SEP]within an hour of leaving the hotel i called them to notify them that there were items in the room that i needed and was prepared to pay for postage back.[SEP]after at least six phone calls to the hotel singapore in the following days and weeks, nothing was ever done about returning the items.[SEP]i see that the reputable website that originally did the booking is no longer accepting bookings from parkview is probably testament to the problems too?[SEP]there are better alternatives in singapore.
1 5	hotel had a great package price.[SEP]the hotel and room was clean and the staff was very friendly.[SEP]helped me find places to eat and watch the game on saturday night.[SEP]the bed was firm and very comfortable.[SEP]nice pool.[SEP]work out room could use some primping but was overall a good place to stay the hotel has a free shuttle to universal studios so you do not have to worry about the parking hassle.
7	wi - fi is not free in the room.[SEP]really?[SEP]it's 2011, this is a no - brainer.[SEP]check - in is slow if you are not a preferred guest.[SEP]front desk, in general, not helpful or friendly (did i suddenly time travel to france?).[SEP]the concessions around the elevators to the rooms are crowded and busy ; they run out of popular items quickly, like a newspaper or yogurt.[SEP]restaurants are hit and miss: mon ami: good food ; spotty service.[SEP]the crepe place: long lines ; dispassionate service.[SEP]the buffet is excellent, but inefficiently run.[SEP]go across to the bellagio or down to the monte carlo for equally great selections in a better - run environment.[SEP]the paris las vegas is a three stars hotel and does not try to exceed those expectations.[SEP]shame on the paris, in this economy![SEP]bright spot: housekeeping.
2	and a touch of elegance too.[SEP]sure, it's not cheap but it's dead centre of all that is happening and but a stone's throw from robson street.[SEP]the fairmont people do an excellent job of keeping up the traditions of a vancouver landmark.[SEP]we were fortunate to be upgraded to the executive floor so had a very comfortable and clean room with impeccable service from the executive desk.[SEP]the dogs in the lobby, i think the original mavis passed on, continue to attract returning guests and new arrivals equally.[SEP]a pat of the dog and you feel like you are home.[SEP]i like the hotel vancouver and would recommend it without hesitation.[SEP]however, if you bring your car, get ready for a big gulp - it's $33 to park it overnight.
1	this was a perfect place to stay for our first trip to nyc.[SEP]the hotel was clean and comfortable, location was perfect and the service was excellent.[SEP]we will definitely stay here again.
1	average everything about this hotel is average.[SEP]i didn't find the staff terrribly friendly.[SEP]rooms have been cheaply refurbished.[SEP]advise against a room on the upper floors unless you want a workout climbing the narrow stairs.[SEP]breakfast is limited and hotel is actuially closer to pimlico than victoria.[SEP]unsure why other travelers give this establishment such rave reviews.[SEP]have been to london half a dozen times and first time staying here, won't stay here again.
2 3 3 9	i decided to plan a trip with some friends to azul fives and could not be happier with my decision![SEP]the minute we arrived to the hotel, we were amazed.[SEP]we were welcomed with cold, fresh towels.[SEP]the check - in process was quick, easy, and the front desk agent did an excellent job of explaining the location of my room.[SEP]the golf carts on property are great and took us to our rooms and wherever we needed on the property![SEP]my room was beautifully decorated and the beds were very comfortable.[SEP]on our last day of our trip, we decided to treat ourselves to a massage at the spa.[SEP]it was the best massage i ever had![SEP]my massage therapist, fanny, was amazing![SEP]the spa was one of the largest spas i had ever been to and the service i received was amazing.[SEP]the food at the hotel was delicious![SEP]i ordered room service one morning and they told me it would take 20 - 30 minutes... they were at my door within 5 - 10 minutes![SEP]i would definitely suggest to dine at the sea olive terrace for lunch at the resort.[SEP]the food is great![SEP]with all the wonderful service i received, delicious meals, and beautiful room, i will definitely be returning soon!
4	just checked out of the radisson edwardian bloomsbury.[SEP]it is certainly not a 4 start hotel as they claim.[SEP]the rooms are run down and quite small.[SEP]but the worst part is the awfull smell in the reception and restaurant.[SEP]they insert some perfume to their ventilation system which is very, very heavy.[SEP]i made this remark to the staff in the restaurant as all food tasted of the perfume - and again upon checking out.[SEP]i guess they do it for a good reason and believe the guests like it - but we certainly did not.[SEP]so we had breakfast in the hotel the first morning.[SEP]it was bad, expensive and had this perfume taste.[SEP]so we never ate there again.[SEP]despite knowing that of course a city like london is not cheap for hotels i think find that the value was very poor.
4 5	the astor crowne plaza was just ok.[SEP]the rooms were clean.[SEP]the restaurant was good, but very expensive.[SEP]parking was $31.50/per night.[SEP]no free internet.[SEP]the staff, namely the lady in charge of the housekeeping, was less than pleasent.[SEP]she dropped by the room three times to ask if we wanted room service.[SEP]we were trying to sleep![SEP]the book in the room said check out is at 12:00 however she insisted that it was at 11:00.[SEP]we love crowne plaza's but were a bit disappointed with this one.[SEP]we'll look around a bit more before staying again.
9	we planned a mini vacation to new york in sept.[SEP]2009 and stayed at laquinta manhattan.[SEP]while my family and i were there i left my cam corder in the business center and the next day it was gone.[SEP]i reported the situation to the general manager who immediatly took actions and reviewed all the camera recoding of the hotel with me.[SEP]based on the review of the recordings, staff identified the person who took the camera, but he no longer was in the hotel.[SEP]general manager asked his staff to keep an eye for the person who stole the camera and meanwhile he contacted the local police and the local hotels with information and the picture of the person who stole the camera.[SEP]surprisingly the same person showed up at the hotel and wanted to use the business center.[SEP]the general manager mr.[SEP]victor alim and his staff confronted the thief and got the camera back.[SEP]during the whole ordeal staff and the general manager conducted themselves in a profesional maner and i certainly believe that a good hotel is run only by capable people.[SEP]thanks.
3	ignore all the poor reviews on this hotel.[SEP]we had a double double room which was clean and spacious for 4 adults.[SEP]the foyer of the hotel is lovely.[SEP]we found the staff helpful throughout our stay.[SEP]the gym was a good size and well equipped compared to other hotels previously stayed in.[SEP]the main selling point to the hotel is of course the location.[SEP]it could nt' be better if you tried.[SEP]just a couple of minutes walk to central park and a short walk to times square with the entrance to the tube next to the hotel.[SEP]would definitely recommend this hotel for a leisure stay!!
7 10 11 17	we have just returned from a week in vegas, we spent 3 nights at south point.[SEP]this place is very nice, spacious, clean and comfortable.[SEP]the elevators were never crowded and ran swiftly.[SEP]the pool was clean, and towels were available for free.[SEP]we enjoyed the 42 " plasma tv and comfortable beds.[SEP]the room and bathroom are huge.[SEP]july is a very busy time in vegas, but this spot was a break from the maddening crowd.[SEP]it is 5 miles from the strip, but they have shuttle service.[SEP]we rented a car, and found that parking was easy.[SEP]we used the garage once, it was more convenient for us to park in the front of the hotel.[SEP]we asked for extra coffee in our room, and the clerk was very kind.[SEP]everyone was friendly.[SEP]we received a coupon book after registering.[SEP]and enjoyed a bogof at the garden buffet.[SEP]they had a large variety and good eating - drinks included!![SEP]our only complaint was, we had to walk a long distance, and open two doors to get to our room.[SEP]i did ask for a quiet room, but that was a bit overboard.[SEP]they also have bowling and a theater.[SEP]check out your coupons for extra savings!![SEP]we will definitely return to south point again.
1 3	used the hotel as a resting point for an overnight stop over before flying out the next morning.[SEP]hotel staff were very friendly, the concierge was extremely helpful.[SEP]the room was adequate without being outstanding, but the close location to the airport caused problems getting to sleep because of aircraft noise.[SEP]airport shuttle service was good, but could be a little drawnout depending on how many hotels had to be visited for pick ups.
5 5	i stayed in this terrible 5 star????[SEP]hotel just for 2 nights, also have a problems with a dental kits, but its nothing with what happend later... after i packed my lugguage and gave it to reception, it was the last day, went for a walk, because had a few houres before flight... when i came back to the hotel pick up my staff, i realised that forgot jacket and trousers in a room wardrobe.[SEP]i told it to reception, they checked room and........ didnt find anything![SEP]than called to person who cleaned my room, and she even said " that saw jacket in my lugguage ", probably she was in a room at time i packed or checked my bags after?????[SEP]i was so shoked and nearly cry, that this discusting situation happend in a one of the " luxury " hotels![SEP]one hour later the hotel staff basically admitted the clothes had been stolen by the staff (" we have a problem with the albanian staff ").i was quite upset & late and my husband phoned the hotel to see if they could transfer me to the airport, but be told " we don't offer that service ", which he suggested is contrary to what's on the hotel website.[SEP]they backtracked & offered to call a taxi, which they never did.[SEP]that was my first trip to venice, as you can see very romantic, peaceful and nice!
5 7 10	stayed four nights and was pretty satisfied with the stay.[SEP]it's a smoking hotel, so all of the rooms smell like smoke, the hallway, lobby and elevator smell of it, too.[SEP]the carpet in our room seemed like it hadn't been cleaned in awhile, but the hotel must have heard this one before because they provide complimetary slippers.[SEP]when i first sat on the bed it was like sitting on a block on cement.[SEP]it was so hard that when i plopped down, i hurt myself.[SEP]there is absolutely no cushion, no bounce, no movement to this bed.[SEP]but surprisingly i had one of the best sleeps i've ever had.[SEP]it's the strangest thing... the wifi was hit or miss.[SEP]i asked the front desk to help and they were pretty useless.[SEP]if you're expecting good customer service, you're not going to find it here.[SEP]the front desk doesn't have any interest in telling where to go, how to get there, or provide any general information about the property.[SEP]this wasn't a problem for us since we got in late every night and left really early.[SEP]it's a prime location for the price.
3 3	third year of a girls' trip to cancun.[SEP]this is the place.[SEP]we will make our fourth trip here and i hope to bring the family one day.[SEP]what makes the resorts above the best is the staff ; and this staff is absolutely above it all.[SEP]i can not name all of the people who made our stay wonderful, but daniel at the desk, vi and vite at the pool, ureal behind the bar, sandra outside the bar, oscar and jose during our meal, andia and luis the chef, rudy and charlie the waiters at chef plate, and the whole entertainment staff are some of the people who spoil the heck out of you.[SEP]i can only say thank you by coming back, and i will, recommend you to others and tell you that there's nothing i can think of that will stop me from returning!!!!!
4 5	loved the majestic loved it.[SEP]was there oct.20th -oct.[SEP]24th.[SEP]went to celebrate my birthday on the 21st.[SEP]it was just plain majestic, the hotel, landscape, food and the staff were all above my expectations.[SEP]the animation crew work hard to please all the guest of hotel, they are very good at what they do.[SEP]big shot out to leo, jesus and jon oh an i can't forget ebalissa she was great too.[SEP]can't wait for my return trip.
1	my wife and i stayed here just last week on a business trip for my company and we were delighted by almost everything on the property.[SEP]every single member of hotel staff were friendly, helpful and easy to communicate with.[SEP]the rooms were quiet - the sound proofing work that has been done in this property is very high quality.[SEP]unlike any other hotel i've ever stayed - in, we couldn't hear anything other than ourselves the entire stay.[SEP]the bed was comparable in comfort to my sleep number bed (an extreme rarity!).[SEP]the room was beautiful, in perfect repair and spotlessly clean - albeit a little small (but this is expected in prime real estate areas like downtown sfo!).[SEP]the location is incredible.[SEP]the fitness area is not to be underrated... it's a rare treat to get a fitness area that's well equipped with free weights and circuit machines... all of which are in good working order and clean![SEP]most hotel fitness areas just have a few bicycles and treadmills, this one had elliptical trainers, stair climbers and much more![SEP]i could probably ramble for a while longer about how much i enjoyed this property.[SEP]lacking was a pool of any kind and the hotel food wasn't the very best i've ever had but was certainly " good enough ".[SEP]great job westin sf market street![SEP]thank you for an awesome stay.
3	i've stayed at the soho grand a few times in recent years.[SEP]for some reason the hotel (but not the wonderful lobby level lounge!) seemed tired looking and more than a little worn out.[SEP]for the $500 a night i was paying i got a tiny king bed room with concrete ceilings and all the ambience of a motel 6 with none of the value.[SEP]yes i know i was paying for location but i couldn't help but feel that i was also paying (through the nose) for some kind of phony nyc chic experience that the shg was not delivering this time around the service seemed labored and/or non existent (did they cut back on the front door staff for some reason?).[SEP]i found it hard to get through to the front desk when i had a question or two.[SEP]stood in line for 20 minutes at the check in desk when my keycard stopped working one day, etc etc.[SEP]just so this isn't a total complain session i can say that the recently remodeled shg lounge on the lobby level really is wonderful.[SEP]great place to hang out and watch the people that are still in awe of nyc chic.[SEP]also it was a pleasant surprise to get free internet for once staying at the james (next door) next time
0 0 0	the most terrible things about this hotel was breakfast, the breakfast was awful with bad smell, the room was dark without cleaning service, the bath was dirty and without hot water in the morning, i had vary very bad memory of this hotel and advice no body go to this hotel.
0 1	enjoy the shopping, restaurants and sites near this well - situated hotel because the rooms and service at this westin are disappointingly average.[SEP]stained comforters, yellow - ish pillows peeking out from their cases, motel - style bathroom and amenities, confused staff (unable to locate a map of the city)... glad this one was on my husband's platinum points.
0 9	charming staff the reviews on tripadvisor persuaded us to choose this hotel and we were not disappointed.[SEP]even after a long and tiring journey, it was easy to drag our bag from the railway station to the porta faenza.[SEP]once inside we were kindly welcomed and immediately felt at home.[SEP]the room (at the back opening on to a courtyard) was small but extremely quiet.[SEP]the bathroom was a good size and well equipped.[SEP]in the morning the breakfast, which included fresh fruit, was all we could have wished for.[SEP]the position of the hotel is ideal.[SEP]the via faenza is not busy but it is in easy walking distance of all the artistic and architectural attractions that we wanted to see.[SEP]in the evening there is a good choice of restaurants a few minutes away.[SEP]the staff, from the chamber maids to the management, were very friendly and extremely helpful, charming in fact.[SEP]we stayed four nights and would use this hotel again.[SEP]we felt it represented very good value for money and we liked its atmosphere.
2	we were one of three families meeting at paradise point.[SEP]the grounds are quite nice, well laid out, good pools.[SEP]all three families had the same experience - very poor in - room service.[SEP]for instance, our 1 bedroom came with a " kitchenette ", which had nothing additional of use to the normal suite - there was no cutlery, no dishes, no glasses or mugs.[SEP]we had to request these to be provided, which took several calls.[SEP]calls for any in - room service were consistently responded to in a friendly fashion, but there was often minimal follow through (requesting something that arrived 7 hours later).[SEP]the resort was quite expensive for the value delivered.
0 2	i guess when i pulled in the parking lot only to find a security staff member asleep in his truck i should have known.[SEP]the lobby clientele resembled a homeless shelter.[SEP]after a 25 min wait at check in i was given the wrong directions to the elevator.[SEP]the room was ok but the wet stain on the carpet grossed me out so i asked for another room.[SEP]the second non smoking room smelled of smoke but i didn't want to change again.[SEP]television was inoperable several times and i had to call.[SEP]bed was clean but not comfortable.[SEP]decided to try the breakfast buffet one morning and wished i hadn't.[SEP]runny eggs & other gross entrees made not so hungry all of a sudden.[SEP]never again![SEP]bottom line: you can do much better for the price.[SEP]this place is owned & operated by the same folks that brought you terrible's gas stations - nuff said.
2	i don't think i could even think of something to complain about..[SEP]food was excellent, the rooms were clean and beautiful, and the location was great.[SEP]the service was exceptional, friendly, and helpful beyond expectations helping us with directions around the city, transportation, and anything else we needed..[SEP]the only thing that was kind of an eyesore more than anything was the construction on the building next door to the hotel, though we couldn't hear or see it from our room, and there was construction all over the city while we were there.[SEP]i would highly recommend this hotel and would definetly stay again.
0 3	i stayed at the hotel place d'armes for business and was treated to lovely accomadations a friendly staff that treats every guest like a vip and a luxurious atmosphere.[SEP]unlike other hotels i stay at for business, this felt like a mini vacation.[SEP]i walked into my room and found music softly playing, a large standard room with natural lighting, a large comfortable bed, a large bathroom (shower only) and was delivered cookies and water that evening.[SEP]i had cheese and wine in the bar and the bar manager was very friendly, remembered who i was and who i was seen with the following evenings so he could point me in my parties direction.[SEP]he made sure everyone was comfortable, had a drink or food in hand, without being overbearing.[SEP]breakfast in the morning was full of choices, the food was good and the coffee was strong.[SEP]i had a lovely stay and look forward to my return.[SEP]i would stay here for business or pleasure without hesitation and highly recommend this hotel for either.
4	we had a wonderful time at this resort.[SEP]the pool area was beautiful with a tiki bar.[SEP]room was very generous with a small patio.[SEP]checking in and out was a breeze.[SEP]all of the staff was very friendly and helpful.[SEP]we would definitely stay here again.
2	paradise point is physically beautiful![SEP]lush, mature landscaping greets you at every turn ; there are several pools for individual taste ; and the location can not be beat.[SEP]what is lacking is customer service, and service problems can ruin any potentialy great vacation.[SEP]room cleaning service was marginal - had to call several times for cleaning that just was not done initially.[SEP]one of the staff at the barefoot bar got so frustrated at our questons about the bill that he actually threw the menu in a corner and walked away.[SEP]with comprehensive staff training in customer service, this would be a world - class resort![SEP]without it, it's just another place in san diego that's beautiful.
1 7 8	we went to vegas for my friend's wedding, there was 22 of us who stayed at hooters.[SEP]we were all very excited to stay, and when we walked in the front lobby (where there was nowhere to sit down, nobody offered to help with luggage) we only got looked at from the not so pleasant hooter's girls that were bartending.[SEP]since it took 35 minutes to check in, we decided to get a drink at the bar.[SEP]$7 beer, way too much for the atmosphere at this place.[SEP]there was black hairs in our room when we finally got our keys to work (out of our 10 rooms, 6 keys did nt work!) we had to go up and down 3 times for 1 room's key to work.[SEP]this is when we figured out the elevator was messed up, it took us to floor 3 when we pushed 2![SEP]we asked for new blankets on the bed and they came a half hour later.[SEP]not so speedy service.[SEP]front desk people were rude when we called and asked for anything.[SEP]the food at the restaraunt was bad![SEP]outdoor bar wasn't open when they said it was going to be when we booked, you had to run all the way to the front lobby to get a drink.[SEP]ridiculous and dirty![SEP]we are going back to vegas in march and there's no way we would ever stay there again!!!!!!![SEP]serious updates needed
8	marco soso i stayed at this hotel for 4 nights just last week.[SEP]yes, it is a good location, and yes, it was clean.[SEP]that's about it.[SEP]the breakfast was not very good, runny eggs, undercooked bacon, unattentive wait staff and a chef that didn't want to cook.[SEP]the rooms are very plain and out dated.[SEP]toilet paper is more like sand paper.[SEP]thin towels and they didn't want to give us anymore unless we turned in the ones we had.[SEP]the carpet seems clean, but looks very used, in the rooms and in the hallways.[SEP]the lobby staff was nice, but none of the doormen we encountered spoke english, and were unable to help with making sure our taxi driver knew where to take us.[SEP]thankfully, we had a business card that had the major sites written in chinese that we could show to our driver.[SEP]we also stayed four nights at the marriott beijing west, what a difference![SEP]see review on marriott for more info.
3	stayed 2 nights in july in this hotel.[SEP]firstly the room was not clean the bedding was dirty and had hair in it - that wasn't ours.[SEP]the air conditioning roared all night i appreciate that all ac units make a noise but this was like a low flying plane.[SEP]the staff are false and not interested in helping- the concierge look at you like you are something he trod in and grumbled about people using the' free' wifi - it's only free in the lobby.[SEP]the only staff who were friendly and helpful were the doormen who were able to tell me where to eat and which subway to get after the concierge was too busy chatting to the reception staff.[SEP]i'd promote them any day!
1	we stayed one night on june 21, 2007 and were very pleased with our experience.[SEP]hotel staff was friendly and knowledgable about local attractions.[SEP]the room was spotless and nicely appointed.[SEP]free internet, available room service and a nice little restaurant and bar on the property.[SEP]hotel is located a block away from the civic center trolley station.[SEP]i will definitely stay there again.
5	we stayed here on the last leg of our honeymoon.[SEP]great location and the entrance is quite grand.[SEP]however as we were checking in we overheard another couple complaining about the size of their room and how the pictures did not do them justice ; we decided to make up our own minds.[SEP]our room was on the 4th floor, had two double sized beds and seemed to be clean enough.[SEP]yes its a bit shabby in places but it was ok for not being in the room much.[SEP]our problem was with a member of the reception staff who was quite rude when we had a problem.[SEP]the maintenance staff were lovely and almost made up for the rudeness of the reception staff.[SEP]would recommend this hotel for budget sightseeing but do nt expected to be treated well by the reception staff.
1 3	the roof terrace that looks so pretty on the website was closed, despite the fact that it was 92f and april, so according to their website it should be open.[SEP]the staff however is too cool to serve a client, so when asked about it they had no idea why this was the case and they did not seem to care.[SEP]same experience the next day when the noise in the room during the night was unbearable due to roadworks and very noisy aircon.[SEP]again the staff gave the impression that even mentioning this was not very cool... the people that run the front desk don't seem to have had any training and are the worst i have ever dealt with - and i travel a lot (!) for work.[SEP]big thumbs down for this place!
4	the hotel was in a great location with easy access to metro.[SEP]rooms were modern (strangely set out) the hotel is completly white.[SEP]we did nt fancy the restaurant to much looked a bit fancy and pricey.[SEP]hotel was very clean.[SEP]the staff i found were a little rude, they did nt ask how our trip was or told us to enjoy the stay.[SEP]i did nt feel like i could ask them much about the city etc.[SEP]however i found this was the case with most of the germans i came into contact with.
13	stayed here feb 2012 for 4 nights.[SEP]location.[SEP]3 mins walk from bus and train station.[SEP]30 mins walk to san marco or 10 mins by ferry.[SEP]being so close to the bus station makes it easy to find when you get lost which everyone in venice does.[SEP]signs for piazzale roma are everywhere.[SEP]at the front of the hotel is the grand canal, and behind is santa groce which is off the main tourist trial, but is beautiful and a change from the crowds of san marco and per rialto.[SEP]hotel.[SEP]we stayed in room 252 which is at the back of the hotel overlooking an alley.[SEP]it was spacious enough and kept clean.[SEP]the decor was traditional with some faded charm.[SEP]good value for the price we paid.[SEP]the only negative was a patch of mould on the bathroom ceiling![SEP]the reception and breakfast area is first class and the staff very smart and professional.[SEP]breakfast itself was good quality.[SEP]there are no tea / coffee facilities in the room and you have to pay to watch tv.[SEP]use of the safe though is included in the price.[SEP]booked everything through jet2 and got a good price.[SEP]i would stay here again.
1	the hotel itself is on one of the main streets in paris and is close to numerous underground stations that are on different lines.[SEP]the reception staff were very attentive and had good english speaking skills.[SEP]the room itself was on the small side with a narrow balcony that ran along the length of the building.[SEP]this overlooked the street.[SEP]the room and bathroom used to get quite warm as the sun was shining straight in on that side.[SEP]the cooling in the room was fine but the bathroom used to warm up quite considerably.[SEP]the location was great - being close to opera as well as the shopping precinct.[SEP]further down towards the ritz and beyond to the eiffel tower and the louvres and the river.[SEP]overall, a pleasant stay and would recommend if the price was right.
1	i have used this hotel four times over the last two years as it is convenient when i am working in dubai.[SEP]the service has become more superficial on each visit.[SEP]this time the complimentary airport pick up was not waiting despite the confirmed email of date, time and flight arrival.[SEP]not what you want when arriving from europe at midnight when i arrived at the hotel the booking was wrong - contrary to the email confirmation.[SEP]spending 15 minutes at 1 am sorting this out is not fun.[SEP]when i got to the room, went to get into bed only to find a live cockroach in the bedding.[SEP]now its about 1.45 am and i am stripping the bed to make sure i have no other six legged surprises![SEP]the room key was then disabled at 12 midday despite late checkout and paying 75% of the room rate for the privilege - which means walking down to reception to get the key reset.[SEP]every time.....[SEP]tiresome to say the least i will not be going back.[SEP]there are plenty of other hotels that want business.
2 3	the stay at the novatel was convenient with places to eat and the convention centre next door.[SEP]the happy hour was a great idea to get together after the expo.[SEP]the food was great and the service was fantastic.[SEP]you have cheerful and helpful staff both behind the desk and at the entrance.[SEP]i really didn't know what time check out was, as leaving at 3 on sunday left us a bit lost.[SEP]it was a bit of a shame the weather didn't hold out for the whole weekend.[SEP]our stay was one to remember.
0	this hotel has it all - excellent & courteous staff, eager to please, superb location, lovely room, relaxing roof top deck, outstanding view of the harbor and near to many excellent restaurants.[SEP]we loved everything about it and will stay there again if we return to seattle!
8	we stayed at the venetian earlier this month and had a great stay.[SEP]the hotel is situated pretty central on the strip, which was one of the main reasons that we stayed there.[SEP]the hotel was clean and really beautiful.[SEP]we had a great room, though we paid extra for a view of the strip, we were really disappointed.[SEP]we had perhaps a 1/4 block view, and yes we saw a bit of the strip, but not enough to really call it a strip view, and it was a waste of money.[SEP]the room was really nice though, and clean, which is always a plus.[SEP]not too sound proof, so we could hear loud people in the halls at all hours.[SEP]overall the stay was great though, and we would go back for sure.[SEP]check out the sin city bar- amazing service, and a great little place to watch a game, if you can get a seat![SEP]we watched super bowl there, and it was one of the best parts of our trip![SEP]also, there was pretty decent shopping in the hotel.[SEP]it's always nice to be able to run out and spend some of that money you win gambling, and the shops were convenient and close.[SEP]lots of little bakeries which was also great- a nice place to grab a pastry and coffee for your first meal.
4 6 10	i was very happy with my room on the 18th floor with it's magnificent view.[SEP]the room was spacious and clean with a very comfy bed.[SEP]there were actually two king sized beds in the room.[SEP]it is also very central - you can walk pretty much anywhere within the city area.[SEP]the staff are not that friendly.[SEP]it is quite a busy desk.[SEP]on arrival, the female clerk curtly told me the room was delayed in it's availability so i would have to come back in a few hours, another day a different clerk was yawning and acted quite bored as i was talking to him ; and another charged me for 3 days parking when i didn't even have a car - luckily i picked this up on my cashcard statement.[SEP]the hotel does not supply breakfast but will give you a discount voucher to have it downstairs at ` the (something - blue?) parrot'.[SEP]don't.[SEP]twice i went there - waited an eternity - and still did not get served.[SEP]the staff there are slack and arrogant.
1	we have been staying at bally's for a number of years now.[SEP]the hotel is getting older, but is still clean and customer service rocks![SEP]we had 2 small maintenance issues that were dealt with immediately.[SEP]it was disappointing to see the rewards centre & the sports betting area closed but i suppose, given the current economy it's not entirely surprising.[SEP]i love the pool area & always have but do wish it was possible to get a pool towel prior to the pool actually opening for swimming.[SEP]we will definitely be back again next year!
4	this place is really horrible.[SEP]the rooms are clean, but worn down with holes in the carpet, grafitti on the furniture and a horrible, horrible smell of cannabis that surely stems from the fact that you are allowed to smoke in the rooms![SEP]everything is secured to the wall like a juvenile prison and alot of noise from the backyard where people where partying.[SEP]we stayed there with my boyfriends mother, and had we known this was not a nice, but cheap hotel in a quiet part of amsterdam, but actually a place to stay for young people getting stoned we would have never booked it.[SEP]the staff is not friendly or helpful in any way, so i'm afraid i can not recommend this " hotel"in any way.
1	well done, from when we entered, unit we left.[SEP]clean room, nice furnishing and, professional service.
1	situated literally within yards of dam square, and easy walking distance of the nearby coffee shops and sex area this hotel is situated above a restaurant and of basic nature.[SEP]the staff are very pleasant and the rooms clean.[SEP]only bad point is the smell from the restaurant downstairs which is noticeable in the hotel, but strangely not apparent when inside the rooms.[SEP]location on a budget best sums up the experience and i would stay here again because of its proximity to the action.
2	this was an all around great hotel.[SEP]it is a 5star hotel with a 5star price though in comparison to other 5stars it's one of the more reasonable ones especially if you have an american express platinum card as you get a discounted price and added amenities booking through them.[SEP]the service is top notch from the minute you arrive to the minute you leave.[SEP]the hotel is very clean and has it's own signature scent though it's barely noticable, nice without being overpowering at all.[SEP]the only thing overpowering may have been their signature statue which was everywhere you turned![SEP]this hotel is very modern with just a touch of traditionalism.[SEP]it has an art deco style to it i'd say.[SEP]the rooms are a nice size and love the double sinks in the oversized bathrooms.[SEP]we stayed in the park deluxe which is just the 2nd room category up but an amazing room.[SEP]you are within an easy walk of the louvre, the opera and many other attractions.[SEP]i honestly can't say i had any negative experiences during my stay and i highly recommend this hotel.
1	i really enjoyed this hotel.[SEP]the staff is wonderful, the property beautiful and the rooms are clean & comfortable.
4	we loved the hotel.[SEP]we stayed in a king room that was lovely.[SEP]there was plenty of room, great lighting, great tv, and nice marble bathroom with cool shower.[SEP](no separate dressing / shower area made me glad i was travelling with my husband.) the bath products were a nice touch as were the comfy robes.[SEP]friendly staff, nice atmosphere.[SEP]one problem was the construction noise.[SEP]although i realize nyc often has construction, our room (10th floor, even side) was directly above the construction.[SEP]on friday and monday at about 4 am something was going on, garbage pick - up?[SEP]moving equipment in?[SEP]not sure.[SEP](i was too tired to get up and look) the workers arrived before 7 and it was quite noisy.[SEP]i asked whether there would be construction on saturday and if so, could we be moved.[SEP]i was told they would know by noon friday and would let me know.[SEP]no one ever called, i hope it was because there was not construction that particular saturday.[SEP]i would need to be assured i would have a quieter room to stay again even with all the other positives about the hotel.
3	stayed over a weekend in november.[SEP]to confirm the information in previous reviews: the rooms are tiny.[SEP]bed was however confortable.[SEP]hotel lobby is noisy, crowded and service is unpleasant (doormen are the exception to this) hotel room was very clean.[SEP](positive note) extremely expensive.[SEP]would not stay there again.
4 5	great hotel, expensive if you take the corner room (fashion week u$600 per night.[SEP]clean room with very good bed and great view over the city.[SEP]large windows, make the room feel bigger.[SEP]handsome bell - boys.[SEP]rather arrogant and slow service.[SEP]breakfast at the standard grill is really anoying, too many waitiers, but bad service.[SEP]located at meatpackers district, which is the place to be.[SEP]i will definately go there again (hope the hotel reads this review!)
2	i arrived on a saturday without reservation, so the price went up $60.00 and they gave me a room right next to the elevator, which upon check - in i did not notice yet.[SEP]the room was small but looked very nice on the surface, however, there was blood on one towel, the jacuzzi bath tub was a little moldy and the toilet was plugged.[SEP]at 2 am some people decided to check out the pool, of course not so quietly as they were supposed to and when i asked the hotel staff in the morning they told me that they heard it, but decided to do nothing.[SEP]upon my complaint they granted me $40.00 discount which i gladly accepted.[SEP]and if you find a safe inside your room which you decide not to use, you should mention it upon check - out or they'll charge the full amount.[SEP]parking can be a problem if you arrive late.
1 5	completely dissappointed when we were told that this was a 4 star hotel, when it is really a 3.[SEP]service from start to finish was the worst i've ever seen except for david the bell - man, the youngest and most hard working of the entire crew.[SEP]the valet manager (i believe) was a snot and argued with my wife in front of a group of guests calling her a liar.[SEP]the room was cute, but the fireplace (heater) doesn't ever turn fully off and we had to keep the window open for ventilation.[SEP]the fresh air was nice, but the trains and traffic didn't allow us to sleep.[SEP]back to the terrible service... at breakfast in 6 7, the waitress was friendly and the food was pretty good, however the restaurant or bar manager decided to call our waitress incompetent and say, " unbelievable, unbelievable![SEP]" as he shook his head and walked away.[SEP]from our point of view she didn't even do anything wrong.[SEP]overall i'd have to say that there was nothing about this hotel that we enjoyed.[SEP]it was one of the worst overall experiences we've ever had and i wouldn't stay there ever again!
3 8	ok so every thanksgiving my family goes to vegas this particular trip was sort of last minute and we asked our boys where they would like stay... now i will say we normally frequent the venetian so our standards are pretty high.[SEP]however, this place was a nightmare... parking was just awful even if you did valet (the wait was just not acceptable).[SEP]first off, they checked us into a room that was in the middle of a re - model.[SEP]when i called down to front desk to explain the clerk was rude and could not comprehend what i was telling her... she didn't believe me?!?[SEP]hello?[SEP]why would i lie about something such as this?[SEP]after finally getting the situation resolved we were moved.[SEP]apparently, security is not tight here... the whole trip teenagers were running the halls at all hours, walls are very thin.[SEP]every time we were in the halls it reeked of pot... not that cared just the fact that it did... the elevator waits were insane... because kids were constantly playing in them... i could go on and on, but i won't basically i would never recommend this place unless you are a young couple out to party and don't care about service and cleanliness.
7 8	is this the worst hotel i have ever stayed at?[SEP]no.[SEP]but the price / quality ratio has to be the lowest ever in 15 + years of traveling overseas.[SEP]the price was over 150usd, i've been far cheaper for budget rooms in paris / manhattan / tokyo, etc.[SEP]i was given the " dungeon " room, by far the smallest, no windows, the bed takes 90% of the room so i have to crawl from the tip of the bed to get in bed, there is no bathroom per say, but a toilet and a shower without any separation so you can smell the toilet from the bed that is 2 feet away.[SEP]for some reason the installed the biggest sink on the smallest counter so you have no way to place anything on the said counter.[SEP]there's also a small kitchen counter and another sink that serve no purpose since both sink are withing 2 feet of each other, no work space, the hardest bed i have ever been in.[SEP]the noise from the other room can be heard, the doors are hard to open and make a loud noise, so when someone goes in or out, you wake up, the staff makes round at 1 am with their walky talky in full volume.[SEP]and don't let me get started about the elevators.[SEP]i'll just say that it took me 10, yes, 10 minutes to go up, grab something and comeback down.[SEP]unless your life depends on it, stay away from this place.
1 3	this is a great hotel in a very good location literally a minute to a metro station, and very close to a variety of shops, including bakeries, supermarkets and cafes.[SEP]the staff were extremely friendly and helfull with travel, tips, on where to eat, and what to say if your french is limited..[SEP]the room itself was quite small, but that is typical for paris i am informed, despite the size, we had every convenience including a great shower, complimentary soft drinks etc, but oddly there was no access to an iron, the staff though arranged for my shirts to be ironed for me free of charge.... the room was spotless and was also soundproofed, and the bed very comfortable, the towels were good quality as was the bed linen..[SEP]the staff though are a real pleasure to deal with and very attentive, the management even gave my wife complimentary champaigne as it was her birthday.[SEP]if you are looking for a good clean friendly and comfortable hotel with easy access to the metro..[SEP]which is a must.... this is it!!![SEP]we will be back.....[SEP]hopefully soon...
0	what an amazing hotel, and the staff was beyond friendly![SEP]personalized postcards from staff members underneath your door etc.[SEP]i asked someone at the pool about where to get a specific alcohol, she directed me to sunset sams then saw me five days later and asked me if i made it there and how i liked it.[SEP]thousands of people... how did she remember.[SEP]the property is impeccable, and incredibly beautiful.[SEP]easy to get to conference center and find restaurants & other amenities.[SEP]great great experience.
2	stayed here 1 night on hhpoints over thanksgiving weekend.[SEP]while the location is wonderful, the management of crowds was poor.[SEP]when checking in, a staff member in the entranceway looked at me with a puzzled look as we removed our bags from a taxi.[SEP]the check - in / out line was quite long - even using the hilton diamond area, i waited for close to 15 mins to check out.[SEP]the executive lounge was crowded and to capacity both in the evening and in the morning.[SEP]the room was nice size and comfortable.[SEP]the location is nice close to 5th ave shopping, central park and times sq / theater dist.
8	i was suffering from a bad cold at my last stay at the hilton new york.[SEP]i ordered food from a delivery service.[SEP]i got a call from the concierge desk letting me know that the food was at the concierge desk for me to pick up.[SEP]i asked if it could be delivered to my room and i was told no.[SEP]in the time it took me to get out of bed and get fully dressed to go downstairs, i received a second call from the concierge desk (different person) basically giving me flack for making the driver wait for me and that the driver was about to leave with my order.[SEP]i rushed down thinking the driver needed my signature or something.[SEP]when i got there he just handed me the food and left.[SEP]besides not helping the situation, the first call from the concierge desk didn't tell me the driver was waiting and the second call i received was rude.[SEP]i was very disappointed with the service i received.[SEP]i pay extra to stay at a four star hotel for the service.[SEP]the room wasn't even that great.[SEP]it was small, one of the phones didn't work, there was still garbage from the previous patron when i checked in the room and it was incredibly noisy at night (not from outside noises - must have been some kind of service elevator).[SEP]i will never stay here again and i'm a hilton gold member.
1	i loved this hotel, it had a great feel at home feel.[SEP]i love the staff so friendly and terry in the boutique shop was so nice and lovely and i felt as if i had known her all my life.[SEP]this hotel is in a great location, near the freeway and the shops.[SEP]the parking was easy and the room was lovely so comfortable and clean and nice.[SEP]i would stay here again and hope to someday.
6	had to wait over two hours for our room.[SEP]not enough staff all the way around.[SEP]the worst experience ever.[SEP]don't do it!![SEP]the pictures on the website are faked as the hotel is old and shabby looking.[SEP]the " continental breakfast "' was some stale muffins.[SEP]the staff was the rudest i have every seen in the service industry.[SEP]parking was a nightmare.
3	nice small hotel in central but quiet location, close to the major sights.[SEP]the jacuzzi was very small though.[SEP]the best was the rooftop terrace where there is a view over the bosporus and the blue mosque.[SEP]the staff is very helpful indeed.[SEP]we could select our breakfast and put it on a tray and the staff would carry the tray up to the rooftop.[SEP]very recommendable!
0 1 3	the only reason i selected this hotel was for its shuttle service and i had to wait for 25 min.[SEP]at the cold of the night for a shuttle to come from 1 km away because non of the super brilliant receptionists told me that it runs on a schedule.[SEP]not even the one i called to ask for sending the shuttle when i arrive to pick - up point.[SEP]it is also very frustrating that they even charge for the usage of the computer at the reception.[SEP]i would say it is totally not worth the money to stay here.[SEP]pay 5 euro to taxi and get another airport hotel even if they don't have shuttle.[SEP]they also advertise on booking.com that they have a pool but they dont!!![SEP]i paid extra 10 euro to access the spa which was really money thrown away
2 4 6	we stayed on the 16th floor in masquesrade tower, large room very quite, pools are nice.[SEP]there is a kids pool, 2ea other pools and an adult pool with tops optional.[SEP]outdoor dining and bar service is speedy.[SEP]we ate at the all american sports grill and mcfadden ’s both were very good and carnival world buffet is amazing (hint text rio to 227466 to get coupons) voodoo rooftop nightclub good place to have a drink.[SEP]check in & out was very fast and pleasent.[SEP]the wife used the spa and workout center and truely enjoyed her self there.[SEP]the property is off the strip but they have free shuttle service to bally's or harrah's on the strip that runs every half hour.
5	we enjoyed the three nights spent here.[SEP]the single rooms were spotless and small but quite adequate.[SEP]there were good reading lights, the free wifi worked with no hitches and there with thoughtful touches (like a kettle)).[SEP]because the hotel is on the main road there was a bit of traffic noise in the early morning but we did not find it a problem.[SEP]the buffet breakfast was very good - much more than the usual continental breakfast.[SEP]the staff were friendly and the receptionist exceptionally helpful and gave us excellent suggestions for local restaurants.[SEP]the location is good - very near a metro and useful buses and rue cler which is lined with cafes and small restaurants is round the corner.[SEP]a very pleasant place to stay in central paris.
3	i was there for a conference but would defintely return for a personal stay.[SEP]the rooms are great with nice views.[SEP]the property is gorgeous... took me 30 minutes to run around the golf course.[SEP]every staff member was about customer service.[SEP]the spa and fitness center are fabulous!
3 4	this hotel is very trendy and the decor was great.[SEP]being a new hotel it was very nice but the room had a sticky substance on the desk.[SEP]also, the bathroom had some hair on the floor.[SEP]i understand things get missed but what got me the most is that when i informed the front desk they simply apologized and told me they were soldout.[SEP]i would expect that service at a lower chain, cheaper hotel but didn't expect it at a hilton product.
2	i love staying here for so many reasons.[SEP]the setting is contemporary, open, airy and just puts one at ease.[SEP]the service staff takes this and runs with it as every need is anticipated and delivered with a smile.[SEP]the rooms are spacious, thoughtfully composed and super comfortable.[SEP]and then of course there is solbar - the restaurant where i eat more frequently than anywhere else in napa - love it.
3	impressive lcation overlooking ground zero.[SEP]we got the other side for our room, very quiet.[SEP]rooms are small (like in most hotels in ny) but well arranged, modern and confortable.[SEP]hotel is modern, trendy and staff extremely helpful and fast.[SEP]they did all our restaurant reservations giving us also advice and maps to get there easily.[SEP]they have a free car service (you can use it once) but we did not book enough in advance but it is great to know.[SEP]the gym is really good, clean.[SEP]the only thing to improve is the room not 100% clean as we can expect for such a high standard hotel.[SEP]of course good but not spotless![SEP]overall very recomandable and we would defibâ¡nitely go back!
2 6	my wife and i just returned home after spending a week @ the royal lahaina resort celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary.[SEP]we had a deluxe room on the 10th floor that had an outstanding view of the ocean.[SEP]all the staff were more than helpful courteous.[SEP]one of our favorite things to do was spend the sunset hour @ the poolside lounge and listen to the guitarist / singer (i'm sorry but i forgot his name) and watch the hula dancer (i believe her name is wainani).[SEP]these 2 folks were so interested in the guests and always took time to ask people where their are from.[SEP]upon finding out the purpose of our vacation, wainani presented my wife with a beautiful lei to bring home.[SEP]the bartenders and waiters / waitresses provide excellant/ speedy service that is 2nd to none anywhere that we have travelled.[SEP]we will recommend this hotel to all our friends and relatives.
18	we booked here because of a sale on travelocity.[SEP]we got a great preview of the grounds when the resort aired on jon & kate plus 8 a few times.[SEP]the grounds to the hotel are beautiful![SEP]i felt like i was in a rain forest.[SEP]many recent reviews are talking about poor room quality, but our rooms were great-- especially for women ; the bathroom and closet area is huge![SEP]i went with my boyfriend and his family.[SEP]everything was clean everyday.[SEP]the pools are nice, although at times, the main pool is just overun by kids, but there is an adult only pool, which is a great idea.[SEP]we ate at barefoot bar & grill, and the food is great![SEP]the prices are moderate for a resort.[SEP]if you are looking for more food for your buck or a bigger menu, i do recommend walking over the bridge to the blue pearl restaurant on dana landing.[SEP]the one down point is location.[SEP]everything is a cab ride away - restaurant, beaches, etc.[SEP]but i think san diego as a city is really spread out in general.[SEP]because we were a party of 5, to many to fit in a regular taxi, we had to call for a shuttle every time we wanted to go anywhere.[SEP]i recommend utilizing the resort's private beach.[SEP]our best day in sand diego was when we rented a kayak from the resort and paddled and laid on the beach all day![SEP]i would go back to paradise point in a heartbeat![SEP]great staff, great rooms, great food.
1	we stayed for 6 nights and enjoyed the very pleasant, green and quiet area the hotel is located in (25 minutes from the city centre by bus).[SEP]the rooms were comfortable and renovated, the staff very friendly and the breakfast buffet offered quite a lot compared to italian standard.[SEP]the in - house restaurant offered good value for money.
3 11	stayed here for a girls out long weekend getaway.[SEP]from the moment we stepped into the lobby of the hotel, we were quite underwhelmed.[SEP]the decor was decent, but it felt more like a 4 start marriott and not up to the usual ritz carlton pizzaz.[SEP]service wad decent, but not stellar.[SEP]the hallways and rooms looked old and weathered.[SEP]the paint job very drab and rather depressing at times with paint chipping off on the ceiling in public areas.[SEP]everything about the property seemed very forced - like it was not naturally meant to be there or to look that way.[SEP]the section of the beach was clearly not " prime " beach real estate for that area and the hotel is surrounded by other less expensive hotels (and at times nicer looking properties) that seemed to have better beaches.[SEP]the view of the ocean here is quite subpar compare to other beaches throughout puerto rico.[SEP]food and drink service on the beach and in the pool area was awful.[SEP]we couldn't get anyone to come take our order, and several times we flagged down a staff member and were snapped at because they did not cover " this section " of the beach / pool.[SEP]as expected though, everything from food to sundries in the hotel was super expensive, but we would want the service and quality of the goods to warrant those prices.[SEP]no way we are coming back to this property.
1	this hotel is one of the cheapest on the strip but not one of the best.[SEP]firstly the rooms are very comfortable and well decorated thye are also very large and the amount of shops and activities in the hotel are rather good but it is at the wrong end of the strip me and my family decided to walk to the other hotels and ride on the' new york new york' rollercoaster which was very fun itself but it took about one hour to get to it and one more hour to get back, also it is lacking in staff to help you around the hotel and one night it took me and my family about an hour to find our room and when we asked a one of the shops they said they had no idea either.[SEP]this hotel needs alot more improvments before my family returns!
2	recently stayed at the buckingham with two colleagues.[SEP]what can i say?[SEP]the service was shocking, the room was the worst i have ever seen, the bathroom was disgusting and there was a strange smell.[SEP]all for 420 dollars per night.[SEP]avoid it at all costs.[SEP]if this is the only hotel available then delay your trip.[SEP]how anyone can rate this higher than terrible is beyond me.[SEP]i stay in a hotel at least 2 nights a week, in many different countries.[SEP]this was worse than the night i spent in a rat infested hotel in guyana.
0	i had a wonderful time, the service was professional and made my first overnight trip to new york really special.[SEP]stella at the welcome desk and richard the overnight welcome ambassador were especially nice and fun to speak to.[SEP]aisha at the concierge desk was helpful with directions and activity planning, all and all it was fabulous and i can't wait to return.
6	this was our first trip to vegas and we chose the bellagio because we were told it was the best.[SEP]naturally i researched the hotel in tripadvisor and reviews varied from the exceptional to the exceptionally bad.[SEP]i have to say they are all correct.[SEP]i do accept that my experience might be typical of vegas itself, however.[SEP]the hotel was beautiful, opulent, exceptionally well furnished and equipped.[SEP]so why the three stars?[SEP]quite simply because you are treated as one of the thousands of' ants' that move through the hotel every day.[SEP]the place is literally swarming with people.[SEP]although we stayed in a penthouse suite there was absolutely no appreciation of the enormous amount of cash spent on our rooms.[SEP]the staff ranged from superb to downright supercilious and superior, with little consistency in between.[SEP]i have been fortunate to stay in some of the best hotels in the world and the bellagio misses out on so many of the small details that add together to make you feel special.[SEP]at the end of the day that is the crux of the matter.[SEP]my advice to you is by all means try this hotel because it really is good, but do n’t stay in a posh room.[SEP]save your money instead for all of the incidental extras that seem to crop up, because nothing in vegas is for free!
3	stayed for 4 nites in a tower 2 room, clean no frills room.[SEP]tower 2 has been reno'd with what seemed like a new bed, carpet, bathroom, nice tv.[SEP]avoid buffet.[SEP]friendly staff throughout the hotel.[SEP]if you are not hung up on high end spots to sleep the ex is alright![SEP]if trying off strip restaurants look up the ghandi restaurant on flamingo by terribles casino.[SEP]lunch buffet is $11 and yummy!
5	we visited vancouver last summer and our travel agent put us in this hotel.[SEP]our room was very dark, the hotel is older.[SEP]we opened the window which looked out onto a rooftop and a brick wall - which didn't help with the light.[SEP]got up for breakfast the next day and there was no coffee downstairs so i had to go out and get coffee.[SEP]spent $70 on breakfast for 4.[SEP]i also remember the staff at the front desk was not the friendliest.[SEP]we wound up moving around the corner to another hotel.[SEP]the room was less expensive, breakfast was included and the room had a window that looked out over the city.
1 1 1	service varied among employees.[SEP]great servidce from club room attendee, front desk and bartender the conceriege was less than helpful.... not there when scheduled and pre - occupied when on duty, reading newspapers, appearing disinterested in providing service.
6 6	i booked this hotel after reading the other trip advisor reviews and ratings.[SEP]what a find in paris!![SEP]my daughter and i were in paris to celebrate her 21st birthday and although i was on a budget i still wanted a' nice' hotel in a' nice' area and the acacias etoile hotel fits these criteria 100%.[SEP]there are many cafe's, shops, bakeries etc.[SEP]right on your doorstep and with the arc de triomph looming large, metro, train, bus and taxi stations just up the road or just around the corner this hotel is in the perfect location![SEP]the room was small'is but perfectly clean with a spacious, clean bathroom (including a tub & shower).[SEP]the staff was helpful and friendly but i have to give a special mention about carla she is the star of the show!![SEP]she went out of her way giving tips and directions and helping with our flights.[SEP]the next time i'm in paris this is the hotel i will stay in!!
0	the pan pacific in seattle is a top notch hotel, staff couldn't have been friendlier and the location has more of a residential feel, than a hotel feel.[SEP]there is a residential building within the complex, along with a starbucks and whole foods, which was very convenient for grabbing a low cost bite.[SEP]fitness center is within the complex, just across the parking lot and very nice.[SEP]also access to the streetcar is right there and walking distance for the more adventurous, doable.[SEP]iif you're looking for tours, " let's tour seattle " is a fantastic one, ask for charles, he's outstanding and takes you off the beaten path a bit, which was great - also " savor seattle " food tour of pike place market, terrific look @ things in the market, nice staff to work with as well.[SEP]the pan pacific is a great choice if you're in seattle and want to be within walking distance to the tourist stuff, yet away from it a bit.
5	i was pleasantly surprised on how cute and confortable soho was.[SEP]the rooms are so modern and i love the buttons to open and close the blinds in the widows and also, check out those sexy showers.[SEP]don't miss the " hot " light button.[SEP]the property is very clean.[SEP]the free internet downstairs was much appreciated.[SEP]the staff was so friendly and willig to assist in any way.[SEP]great location and just across the street from the metro.[SEP]i can't wait to go back.[SEP]thanks soho!
2	hands down, this hotel exceeded my expectations![SEP]for a first visit to the pacific northwest, the maxwell understands the essence of what it means to create the ultimate customer experience.[SEP]we were greeted warmly by the staff at the front desk and they even allowed us to check in early.[SEP]the lobby is spacious and elegantly decorated.[SEP]the room was amazing.[SEP]from the cozy bed to the sleek decor to the large shower, all our senses were engaged.[SEP]we had time to use the pool and gym, although they were on the smaller side they were clean spaces which is always nice![SEP]my spouse and i are planning to take another trip to seattle and we will be repeat customers.[SEP]thank you maxwell for an amazing stay and intro to your beautiful state!
0 3	service is excellent and very clean.[SEP]good location being close to all destinations in town.[SEP]if you require a cab it is instantaneous.[SEP]very friendly staff and coffee to go of a morning.
7 8 9 10 12 16	just returned from a week at the catalonia playa maroma.[SEP]check in was at 3 we were not able to get into our room until 5.[SEP]we were told they had overbooked the hotel and we were offered a room at the sister hotel.[SEP]we declined because we had other family members joining us the next day.[SEP]we had booked a priviledged room..[SEP]and requested a king bed.[SEP]this room had 2 very small queen beds..[SEP]the air conditioner wasn't working..[SEP]the coffee pot spewed coffee all over the counter..[SEP]ants were all over the room... cigarette butts all over the balcony and the mini bar was a very small fridge with 2 beers, 2 cans of pop and 2 bottles of water which were all warm because the fridge didn't work.[SEP]the next day we went to the front desk and complained.[SEP]the only thing they had available was a regular room..[SEP]so we had to down grade with no type of refund.[SEP]we had no iron, no ironing board, no clock and no alcohol in the small warm fridge..[SEP]the air was a little cooler but the ceiling fan had to be kept on to make it comfortable in the room.[SEP]the phone also didn't work..[SEP]the service at the pool or on the beach was not very good.[SEP]food was average.[SEP]the lobster was excellent, but came with a $50.00 charge for each person.[SEP]the lobby is open air as well as 3 of the 5 restaurants.[SEP]it was very hot eating.[SEP]the beach was gorgeous.[SEP]the only plus for this hotel.
8	we traveled to seattle from the san francisco bay area by amtrak and stayed two nights at the hilton.[SEP]the location is good.[SEP]i would describe it as an upscale area of the business district.[SEP]a beautiful view of the sound or bay from our window.[SEP]we had a bit of a walk to pike place market that was mostly flat, then downhill for about a block.[SEP]the area is beautiful, so walking around was no problem.[SEP]the room was very nice and clean.[SEP]the hotel was quiet.[SEP]i really appreciated getting away from the tourist hubbub each evening.[SEP]the only downside, there was not much in the way of dining onsite for a family with small children.[SEP]there is a bar off the lobby with a few tables and chairs and this was the " restaurant ".[SEP]i thought the limited menu looked pretty good for a business traveler, however, for children ages 6 and 11, not many choices.[SEP](i suppose that most visitors to seattle prefer to eat out since there are so many excellent restaurants.) the hotel staff readily recommended a family friendly restaurant (rock bottom) less than 1/2 block walk away, which was a very good pizza / brewery with a varied menu but specializing in gourmet pizza choices.[SEP]so, the inconvenience was very minimal.[SEP]in fact, when we got to the restaurant, there was another family from the hotel that had been directed there by staff.
3	my husband and i stayed at the w for our 10th wedding anniversary, just one night.[SEP]i loved everything about this hotel except the price.[SEP]we would have loved to stay longer, but couldn't afford it.[SEP]the service was impeccable.[SEP]the room was clean and luxurious... love the brand new look![SEP]the bathrooms were particularly impressive.[SEP]the heavenly bed is just as it states... heavenly.[SEP]we stayed on the 30th floor, so no noise issues to speak of.[SEP]the view down on times square was impressive.[SEP]the hotel is conveniently located to everything we wanted to do... broadway show, times square, rockefellar center and the train station.[SEP]i recommend it to anyone who wants to splurge!
1	is this the best hotel in venice?[SEP]i believe so ; the staff went out of their way to make us feel comfortable in our new surroundings, the room was truly breath - taking from the glass chandalier to the fourposter bed and the morning breakfast was above standard.[SEP]to add to this every morning me and my family were awoken by the view of the rialto bridge which as you can imagine was a once in a life time experience but the best thing for me, in terms of simple pleasures, that the hotel had to offer was the panoramic terrace ; available to all visitors although few ever take the time to see, it has views all the way up and down the grand canal and admittedly my favourite part of my trip to venice was buying a italian wrap from the shop downstairs, taking it to the terrace and sitting in the sunshine all afternoon.
0 2	great hotel well located, with friendly and efficient staff.[SEP]good value for money.[SEP]housekeeping was however a bit lacking with room on one occasion only being made up at 1600 hours!![SEP]tv / radio system went offline every night so when one was dressing in the morning there was absolutely no tv available to watch news etc.[SEP]this happened three nights in a row.
2 4	we've just been spoilt.[SEP]spoilt so badly that the thud back too home life has left bruises.[SEP]the quality of staff, decor and location, place the sir stamford cq at the pinnacle of excellence in sydney.[SEP]if your ideal is concrete and glass suspended well above the heart of this city, immune to the gentle breezes and vibrant sounds, (when desired), then this hotel is not for you.[SEP]however, if you wish to experience manhatten service, grand english country house decor coupled with a gentlemans club style bar and food that is fresh and well prepared then please do yourself a favour and base yourself here.[SEP]myself and three family journied home after ten days of memorable experience but agreed there was none better than our two nights at sscq.
4 5	i travel about every week for business and stay in the hilton / hilton chain for the points and usually my stays are fine there.[SEP]this was my first and last time at the hilton downtown miami.[SEP]where do i start?[SEP]checking was fine and the room view was outstanding... that's the good.[SEP]valet service is god awful.[SEP]there is a dedicated attendant in a booth working but she doesn't pick up her phone... what's the point.[SEP]then when i got my car 10 minutes later the attendent just handed me my keys and walked away... a total joke.[SEP]the room,... bathroom had hair on the sink and tub.[SEP]the ventilation system (not the ac) was loud and could not be turned off... i am not the type that needs total silence to sleep but i was counting the days to get the he'll outta here.[SEP]i was 5 rooms away from the elevator and the noise in the hall of just the elevator was annoying.[SEP]i asked to change rooms and was met with attitude and a " check back later, we have no rooms left ".[SEP]i just smiled and went to work.[SEP]you need to take an elevator to get to the registration.[SEP]then after registration you need to walk to a different set of elevators across the hotel to get to your room.[SEP]a design genius put this hotel together clearly.[SEP]my lesson![SEP]all hiltons are not the same.[SEP]i will be back on business in miami soon and am damn sure i'm not staying here.[SEP]don't make the same mistake i did.
5 5	good hotel for airport stopover whenever i fly out of schipol / netherlands, i stay at the ibis the night before my flight.[SEP]the rooms are a litte small, but they have a long counter along the window that is great for organizing the suitcases before going home.[SEP]the rooms are always clean and the water pressure good in the shower.[SEP]the shuttle service to the airport is on time.[SEP]this hotel has a lot of people coming and going.[SEP]hotel staff tend to be stressed and for me they did not go out of their way to enhance my visits with them.[SEP]once when i was there, the elevator was broken, so we had to take our suitcases up the escalators - no one asked to assist us.[SEP]they have a few restaurants inside the hotel.[SEP]not great food, but prices are fair.[SEP]this is a noisy hotel, depending on the other guests.[SEP]i've had some stays that are very quiet, and others when the high school kids are in town and are running from room to room.[SEP]they have no smoking rooms.[SEP]it is a very large hotel, but the price is good if you just need a place to sleep before catching your flight.
4	so, the 2 most important things to me in a hotel ; good beds and bedding, and good ac / heat.[SEP]the sheraton had very nice beds and bedding, however, the ac (80 degrees outside) was so poor that i never could get the room cool.[SEP]with the fan on high, it barely blew any cool air.[SEP]it was very uncomfortable.[SEP]good location, nice staff, average room service.[SEP]but it just needs to be comfortable, so i would not return.[SEP]also, paint was peeling off the bathtub??
1 2	they will try and rip you off, read your invoice before you check out.[SEP]this hotel needs new management and staff.[SEP]they were not nice people.
1 4	very well located but very expensive for a 4 stars hotel.[SEP]with a rack rate of 600 euros per night you can expect a minimum service.[SEP]we had to bring our luggage up and down by ourselves and the internet broke down for half day.[SEP]the amenities dodn't get refilled and the fresh towels were dirty.[SEP]the night staff was nice although the day staff was very unpleasant.
2	stayed for 2 nights and wanted something close to the docks since i was going to the cape via the fast ferry.[SEP]the hotel is under a major renovation but understand that all properties go through this.[SEP]the staff was very helpful and friendly ; from check - in to the bellhops who happily helped you with your bags.[SEP]room had a great view facing the italian north end toward the old north church and was perhaps a bit quieter.[SEP]had a room with 2 double beds and was very comfortable.[SEP]especially liked the in - room safe where you could store valuables.[SEP]did not experience the dining room or other amenities in the hotel other than room service.[SEP]for the convenience and location, would make this a place to stay on future trips.
1 9	we had only 2 days to spend in paris so we needed a central location to make the most of the time we had.[SEP]we were able to get into our room early in the morning after our overnight flight, which was greatly appreciated.[SEP]our room was enormous by european standards, very modern and clean, and quite comfortable.[SEP]even with the overcast skies, the view from the hotel balcony overlooking the parisian rooftops was glorious.[SEP]we were able too purchase hop on ticket buses from the hotel, saving us more time.[SEP]it was a quick 5 minute walk to the bus stop on the champs elysee.[SEP]after a day of sightseeing, we had dinner in one of the many cafes along wagram avenue, and we felt perfectly safe in the vicinity of the hotel after dark.[SEP]we had no trouble sleeping in the hotel bed which was supremely comfortable.[SEP]we checked out early on day 2, and the hotel stored our luggage in a locked room until late afternoon.[SEP]the staff was pleasant and helpful.
5	the hotel was my first stay in london and i was looking forward to good sleep after long flight.[SEP]got to room and was taken back.[SEP]small with absolutely no privacy to talk inside room because i could hear other guests in adjoining rooms.[SEP]it was challenge to move in bathroom and very little in terms of toiletries.[SEP]so beware if u forget anything.[SEP]the housekeeping and room service don't respond and phone calls are unattended for long time.[SEP]breakfast is spartan at best and if you are vegetarian then forget about having food here.[SEP]it though looks great on webpage in reality it is just found lacking in everyway.[SEP]you would definitely think twice staying here unless you don't mind all the above and most off all indifference.
0 3 8	despite its enticingly modern build, this hotel could expedite its service.[SEP]we tried checking in around noon on a sunday, however, the front desk was packed with at least one hundred people in unorganized lines.[SEP]the people behind me were checking out, we were checking in, there were no signs or anyone directing " traffic, " so to speak.[SEP]there was nobody at the front desk until we complained about waiting for at least half an hour before even getting assisted.[SEP]once we were assisted, we were told our room wouldn't be ready until about 6 pm and that we could leave our luggage at the bell desk.[SEP]the bell desk's line was even worse than the check in![SEP]once we finally got our room hours later, our room was absolutely beautiful and huge.[SEP]the amenities are stunning and modern.[SEP]the staff is helpful, however very slow.[SEP]all in all, a great hotel but they could use a little more help in the check in / check out department.
3	entering the hotel i look sowhat old fashioned, sad and dark (lot of dark brown colours.[SEP]from there everything was very pleasant and comfortable.[SEP]all business trip were to this part of town so location was ok.[SEP]good choice of restaurants all with excelent food and exceptional pleasant service.[SEP]my rooms was orientated towards garden and pub activities that caused some sound disturbance in the beginning but later on i joint the pub and club so understood better the noise.[SEP]tge ratle snake looks a bit out of place with too many girls looking for company but the live music is good.
5	the only good point was the location, but it smelled so bad around there.[SEP]you can hear people snoring next room.[SEP]there was no window.[SEP]we had to share the bathroom and it was not clean.[SEP]they didn't have the elevator, so it was really hard to bring the big baggage to upstairs.[SEP]when we asked the staff to bring up the baggage, they told us to pay for that.[SEP]the room was really small.[SEP]we even couldn't open the baggage on the floor, so we had to opened it on the bed.[SEP]the bed was not confortable at all.[SEP]the bed cover was too small for the bed.[SEP]i strongly recommend not to stay there.
0	from the moment that pass through the front doors to the moment you leave, the service from the the staff at this hotel could not have been better.[SEP](they can plan you route however i would just try and get lost... more fun) book taxi's, gondolas, recommend some of the best off the tourist path restaurants.[SEP]not to mention some a amazing cocktails.[SEP]the rooms can only be described as palatial, they are at a very high standard and extremely clean.[SEP]i would challenge anyone to fault it.
3	my family and i were a bit concerned reading the reviews, but we just can't understand the negative feedback.[SEP]we stayed in the marina section, the room was terrific and up to date.[SEP]no problems at all with the room.[SEP]the staff was ok, but i can see how people felt that they were too negative.[SEP]the only bad thing really was the restaurant quality for the prices.[SEP]many options, including otellos italian cuisine.[SEP]the meal at otello's was certainly lackluster and way overpriced.[SEP]trips to palomino were terrific.[SEP]the funicular was being serviced a couple of times, but it did not seem to slow us down too much.[SEP]one of the pools was being serviced.[SEP]i would certainly recommend this hotel and stay there again.
2	stayed here for 5 nights in november 2010.[SEP]had a 10th floor room facing the central shaft but that high up i didn't hear any noise and could still see out into the street.[SEP]i thought everyone of the staff that i interacted with was exceptionally friendly - room service, house keeping, front desk, and the bar.[SEP]they didn't put out a room service menu one day so the room service people contacted housekeeping and i got a personal note of apology for what is really a small thing.[SEP]everything was clean and tidy.[SEP]the location is great - immediately adjacent to the gaslamp quarter and to the trolley.
4	this hotel was everything i had expected from reading other reveues on ta and from the hotel's own website.[SEP]it is beautifully decorated with a nautical theme running throughout the hotel.[SEP]there is nothing dated about this place, (unlike many other hotels in venice), indeed on the inside it looks like it was built only yesterday, but it still has a traditional charm thanks to the beautiful wood panelling, brass fittings, plush soft furnishings and marble bathrooms.[SEP]we really couldn't have expected more.[SEP]the staff are extremely friendly, helpful and couldn't do more to make you feel welcome.[SEP]all the rooms have fantastic views as far as i can see and we enjoyed a picture perfect view of the lagoon, san giorgio, along the waterfront to st marks,... it was like a postcard![SEP]breakfasts in the hotel were very nice - a lovely selection with baked goods, etc and the usual attentive staff and again a lovely setting inside or out on the waterfront.[SEP]i would strongly suggest anyone should stay at this hotel if visiting venice and i would definitely go back to this hotel, no question.[SEP]very highly recommended!
3 9	here are my pros and cons pros - rooms have been renovated so the beds and sheets are comfy and the bathrooms are nice.[SEP]if you like vietnamese food they have a great menu selection, the noodle bowls were amazing![SEP]central location in the heart of everything.[SEP]cons - long waits to check in - as much as 2 hours in line.[SEP]checking out at 7:30 am on a friday took much longer than expected as well.[SEP]i called with a few questions and the front desk put me on hold for minutes before picking up (not typical of vegas hotels) this is an old hotel so it is not sound - proofed.[SEP]you hear the explosions of the pirate show as well as any noise coming from the strip.[SEP]if you want to sleep (many don't in vegas) don't stay here.[SEP]fitness center was poor, you couldn't find a cardio machine because they were all occupied plus when you came in the am there was yet another line waiting to get in and it closed at 7 pm so you could not get in later at night.[SEP]overall my thought is nice rooms with really bad service and sound proofing.[SEP]there are too many other hotels in vegas for the same price to stay here again.
3	there are many hotels in sf and i travel here often, so i thought i would try the w.[SEP]well, the hotel is cool, and the rooms are decent but i will not select this hotel again.[SEP]it's just not woth the extra money when you can stay at many similar styled hotels that cost much less in the city.[SEP]the staff is excellent and i did like that they will deliver a coffee maker to your room and another good thing about the room is a long desk with plenty of plugs.[SEP]i do wish more hotels would think of female travelers and have more plugs in the restroom.[SEP]the air in the room never really got very cool.[SEP]at 4 am noisy people in the hallway, cheap small little travel hair dryer (come on).[SEP]the location is not that great but i did walk about a third of a mile to the nearest starbucks.[SEP]the walk was nice but the neighborhood is a little sketchy.[SEP]a little difficult to find the valet parking and the parking is over $45 a night and the one thing that just got me was a tiny bottle of water in the bathroom that was $6.[SEP]that is just ridiculous as it was probably around 8ozs.[SEP]they could make money and charge half that much and not looked so greedy..[SEP]that just really erked me even though i wouldn't buy it at $3.
1	i stayed at the avni hotel in february 2008 as i thought it was a cheap and convenient way to stay in london and visit friends in the area - however i quickly realised i was mistaken: 1) the room was small, freezing cold and the heating did not work 2) when i moved the bed 10 cm to one side to be close to a lamp (only one lamp in the room which was very dark) there was so much dirt under the table (would be to impolite to describe what it was).[SEP]3) i could not lock the door to my room (on ground floor so very uncomforting) 4) the front desk staff and the manager (sunil) were extremely rude and unhelpful when i asked about the possibility of getting another room (which i did not get).[SEP]5) i checked out one day in advance and despite giving notice they still charged me.[SEP]all in all a very unpleasant experience which i would not recommend to anyone.[SEP]their cancellation charging practices are also unethical and i wish to see them out of business soon.
0	we enjoyed 3 nights here and found the staff to be so helpful and friendly.[SEP]the rooms were comfortable (small, but this is paris!) and nicely decorated.[SEP]the bathroom is small, but usable.[SEP]the location is great - just 1 block from the tuilieries metro stop and the garden.[SEP]you can walk from here to many areas of paris.[SEP]there are wonderful pastry shops and restaurants nearby.[SEP]we would definitely stay here again!
0 1	stayed at the st regis for the first time and was completely shocked by the service quality and rooms.[SEP]for the price i would have expected the rooms to be perfect and the service to be flawless but in reality neither the rooms or service met expectations.[SEP]i asked a member of the hotel staff what was occurring that could impact the hotel and he mentioned that the hotel was cutting hours due to the current economic environment.[SEP]next time i will stay in the four seasons as i hear the service is still quality.[SEP]this hotel seems to be in a bit of a death spiral as the rooms are not full, service is being cut as a result and guests are now going else where which will most likely result in further cuts to services.
1	we stayed at the renaissance harbourview in late september, and were impressed by the location and qualities of the hotel.[SEP]however, we found the staff were somewhat keener on extracting a profit than on providing old - fashioned service.[SEP]based on past experience, i prefer the grand hyatt opposite!
2	come with no expectations and they will be met![SEP]before staying here come with absolutely no expectations and they will be met.[SEP]from check in to check out staff showed no signs of being glad we chose the ambassador.[SEP]mold could be seen growing on our tub.[SEP]walls seemed to be made of paper as we shared in most of our neighboring rooms conversations and laughter until 3:00 in the am.[SEP]staff did have them turn down their tv about 2:00am, how do you control how loud people talk?[SEP]our last night a drunk tried coming into our room!![SEP]they are renovating this old coffee warehouse, you would think the staff would work extra hard for guests - not.[SEP]back at home now - if you are looking for a place to stay in new orleans there are over two hundred better than the ambassador and just as close to all the excitment this beautiful city has to offer.
1	i am currently staying in your hotel and the room is fine.[SEP]however your restaurant is horrible -- the food is terrible, the service is awful, and when i ask for fresh dessert, the waitress tells me the desserts are frozen, they are microwaved -- are you serious -- i just had the wild bc salmon and that was disgusting -- sitting on only 2 tbsp of rice, fish smelled awful.[SEP]i will never eat at your hotel restaurant again -- you need better food on your menu.
1	great location just stayed for a few days at grant plaza.[SEP]location was perfect for us our room was spacious and clean (we think it was the one shown in the brochure) the staff were very helpful.[SEP]we thought it was good value
5 6	i stayed in this hotel with my husband and our 3 year old daughter.[SEP]we are frequent guests to nyc and since this hotel is in the short distance to all attractions we always booked it.[SEP]however, last time we stayed in, we were robed by a maid.[SEP]nasty [ -- ] took $4000 us from my purse when we were enjoying christmas concert in radio city.[SEP]when we came back to the hotel after the concert i noticed that the room was cleaned second time, so i decided to check all my purses and suitcases.[SEP]at that time i discovered that money were stolen.[SEP]when i ran downstairs to complain the security guy did not even care, i was advised to wait till the morning.[SEP]we had to call the cops but they said to forget about our money.[SEP]next day a manager on a duty told us that it happens very frequently here and we are not the first one being robed.[SEP]i could not stop but wonder did i come to the third world country?[SEP]unfortunately that was a day when nyc lost its glamor in my eyes.[SEP]so, if you are looking for a cheap deal do not come to this hotel.[SEP]it doesn`t worth it.[SEP]i could be reached by e - mail at: oxana142003@yahoo.com
1 4 6	this is a great trendy neat hotel in a great location right near times square.[SEP]however, i received terrible service from the managers but not from all other low - level staff.[SEP]i had called to ensure i could get a room with 2 double beds.[SEP]i could not because they were sold out but was able to get a king bed for a very reasonable upgrade.[SEP]this simple transaction involved a 20 min wait on the phone and being shuffled around between various different staff who didn't seem to know how to help but just kept passing me off.[SEP]on top of this, they then double charged me for the upgrade.[SEP]given how expensive this hotel is, i thought they gave particularly poor service.
11 14	this is a great location to stay.[SEP]close to union sq station on the subway, which makes getting almost anywhere really easy.[SEP]lots of cheap food options and a good quality supermarket (whole foods at union square).[SEP]union sq also has a farmers market 4 times a week which has lots of good food.[SEP]the hotel itself is pretty run down.[SEP]it trades on the fact that madonna stayed there once and woody alan made a movie there.[SEP]this hasn't help the dated decore, old furnishings, flaking plaster and tiny bathrooms (which are shared!).[SEP]we stayed 8 days and usually had no problem getting a bathroom in the morning or evening.[SEP]the room has it own hand basin and towels were supplied, but you had to ask for fresh ones (see below).[SEP]the room had aircon which was very loud but kept it cool.[SEP]in fact the noise of the aircon help drown out the noise of the street and other residents slamming doors.[SEP]the bed was reasonably firm and the room was only made up in the mornings if you specifically asked for it, otherwise the maids wouldn't go near it.[SEP]reception staff were typical of most us hotels in the budget range.[SEP]courteous but don't ask too many questions as it just annoys them.[SEP]usually they looked bored when you spoke to them and their responses were lacking any enthusiasm.[SEP]overall, the hotels location is it's saving grace.[SEP]great for anyone wanting to experience manhattan, but don't expect the ritz when you stay here.
1 6	we booked this room on a discount hotel site for a great price so i wasn't expecting a lot.[SEP]i was so pleasantly supplied![SEP]our room was beautiful - very clean & modern and very large.[SEP]there were two queen size " sleep # " beds (so great!) and a pull out couch.[SEP]this was great because we were traveling as a family of 5.[SEP]they gave us a great little welcome package with little necessities in it (from altoids to a shick razor).[SEP]positives - great rooms, friendly service, very close to disney![SEP]downfalls - it's on a boulevard so being unfamiliar with the area it is hard to get to ; the standard orlando hotel sales pitch with the enticement of free tickets.[SEP]no breakfast included and the breakfast buffet is pricey.... but there is a waffle house in the same parking lot that was delicious!
1 1	i've stayed and eaten in many shangri la's around the world but this was very poor.[SEP]i ate in the cafe restaurant, service was very poor, whilst they have nice staff it lacked management and organisation of a world class hotel chain.[SEP]i was served a chicken cesear salad with pork and a poached egg on it when i pointed out it was pork not chicken they took it back and just removed the pork and placed re - cooked chicken on it and ohhh a new poached egg........?!![SEP]i ve never had a poached egg on a cesear salad.[SEP]my starter of 3 scallops took 30 mins which was nice but the restaurant was empty.....?! when i eventually got served and asked for the bill and the manager came to see me - she offered me a complementary banana so i wasn't hungry as i didn't eat the salad.[SEP]i took time to fill in a complaint card and gave it to guest relations who wasn't interested as she was gossiping to another employee, when i tried to discuss it with her she just said thanks for filling in the card.......,, really not good at all and unusual by shangri la standards
2	i stayed in animal kingdom lodge in 2007.[SEP]everything about this hotel was fab![SEP]the swimming pool was great, the food was great, the staff couldn't have been more friendly.[SEP]the savannah veiw was amazing.[SEP]imagine not only waking up to a blast of heat when you go out onto your balcony, but you're welcomed by a giraffe staring into your window![SEP]which is totally unique for hotels.[SEP]we only had 2 main problems when we stayed there which was the hotel was quite far away from any parks- the nearest was' animal kingdom park.' also, in the evenings there wasn't much to do apart from eat and go for a walk.[SEP]however, i'd definatley stay there again and i would definatley advise people who are trying america out to stay there![SEP]we're going back this year and staying at a different hotel, which will hopefully we just as brilliant as animal kingdom lodge.
4 4	we booked a suite with two beds and ended up with a double room with one bed.[SEP]multiple " sorry " and limited effort to fix the issue - a free breakfast was thrown in.[SEP]shower leaked, modern lights were non - functional and rooms are loud.[SEP]i say forget it... there is a huge selection of fantastic middle - class hotels in barcelona.[SEP]the great location of this one doesn't make up for the below average rooms, ammenities and service.
3	we went in november 2010, the weather was a cold drissle that weekend.[SEP]we walked to many places from there, including a liquor store to pay half the price for a.375 l patron, which we drank and had a great time in the room one night.[SEP]you get a bose radio that has a music connector also.[SEP]the staff was really nice and the rooms were modern but functional.[SEP]the price was great.[SEP]also i'm a car junkie and someone had a ferrari outside for the night.[SEP]pretty sweet.[SEP]anyways, the walkability to michigan avenue is a 7 in the winter and probably 8 - 8.4 in the summer.[SEP]there was a bar, which i think was intended to be a club, that was empty, but it was awesome because we didn't have to pay $450 to get a table, and it was literally a club atmosphere, which too was sweet.[SEP]it was right next to the house of blues too.
3 4 8	my wife and i were booked into the empire hotel for three nights commencing 23rd, april 2011.[SEP]this hotel was booked on our behalf by a cruise company as part of a 14 day trip covering las vegas, new york and returning on the qm2.[SEP]when we arrived at the hotel we had trouble getting into the reception due to lots of people outside presumably waiting to get into the hotel for partying.[SEP]we finally got to reception and to be honest the attitude of the staff left alot to be desired.[SEP]we got our room key for a room on the first floor and struggled with our two cases into the dirty lift, no one offered any help at all.[SEP]when we entered our room we couldn't beleive how small the room was, there were no wardrobes the floor was dirty and when we opened the blinds we looked out into another walled area.[SEP]there realy was not enough room for us to unpack our suitcases.[SEP]my wife was in tears so we went down to reception to say we were cancelling our booking and going to find a more suitable hotel.[SEP]the assistant guest manager was quite blase' about our concerns and really didn't seem bothered that we were leaving.[SEP]we then got into a taxi and stayed at a real 4 * hotel in lexington avenue and made sure we enjoyed our time in fantastic new york.
11	we recently stayed for 3 nights at the paris las vegas.[SEP]it's one of the few resorts without resort fees which saves up to $40 a night per couple.[SEP]free parking and super convenient location on the strip.[SEP]be sure to ask for a bellagio view- we watched the fountains all evening![SEP]we stayed on the 23rd floor and we could still hear the nightclub on the 10th floor.[SEP]our concierge had warned us about it and even provided earplugs, which we appreciated![SEP]it only happened on saturday night so it wasn't a big deal.[SEP]the restaurants in paris are good- we ate at the crepe place and went over to nosh in bally's for breakfasts.[SEP]the downstairs lobby area and casino are very interesting, painted and decorated to look like paris streets.[SEP]it was a " themed " hotel but without being ridiculous or overwhelming.[SEP]the rooms were large and comfortable and the bathrooms were ridiculously huge.[SEP]very good maid staff as well.
5 5 5	just got back from spending four nights at the carter and have to say believe what you read.[SEP]we travelled with another couple and both our rooms stank, theres of damp(although improved after 2 days by a new shower curtain so the whole room smelt of plastic) and ours of what can only described of as s#*t.[SEP]they really did stink.[SEP]our carpet was filthy and looked like it could be housing all types of creatures whilst our friends room had a damp patch on the wall about 2 foot long.[SEP]the handles on the draws in there room was cable flex as was the light pull in our closet / wardrobe, which also stunk and was filthy so we lived out of our cases.[SEP]we had no problems with the staff but had a laugh at the $1 charge for your key and $2 charge to leave your baggage after checking out.[SEP]on the plus side the location really is first class, 300 yards from times square.[SEP]our sheets and towels where clean and had no need to use the ones we took with us after reading other reviews.[SEP]the air con worked and there were no signs of rats, cockroaches, druggies, murders or prostitutes, all of which we expected to see in the lobby after looking at our room for more than 5 minutes.[SEP]i would certainly never go back but am allready looking back and laughing at the experience, so if you can stand the smell and are prepaired to slum it the location really is fantastic for the price.
